review_description
The interface is so mot intuitive....
"I love to use it for music but after my ""30 minutes of ad free music"" ends I get an ad after every 2-3 songs unless I change my playlist. I can also play any song w/o shuffle on any other device rather than on my phone, which, imo, is quite stupid. It would be nice if they re-added that feature on phones w/o having to buy premium. All that aside, it's a good app to listen to music on if you have premium"
There's always some kind of technical difficulty happening within the app but usually quick to fix em. Other than that it's a great app for music. (Unless they keep removing stuff you like)
"Obvious stuff, they don't care about fixing long standing problems of their app on androids. I would appreciate if they could at least post the the version number of the last version that actually worked, so I wouldn't have to scour the internet to see what I can do to get a Spotify app that isn't half broken. But I guess that would also require admitting fault which I can only assume their attitude toward is ""why bother‚Äù"
Please Fix the goddamn UI. It is getting frustrating to you use the app.
Big shoes to fill lol. My suggestion would be to keep a functional non expiring app that is free sure throw in adds you deserve to make money too. I rarely have the luxury of purchasing anything above my immediate required needs like many but when I can and I've given this a lot of thought over the years I will go with what I trust like sure I want music without ads so I would stick with the app I already have and trust but I wouldn't stick with a free app if I have to redownload it every week.
literally this was such a good music app but than after this dumb update it ruined everything now I can't even listen 2 the songs on my playlist to check them out real quick and than you always add songs to my playlist even when I add enough songs so you don't do that it's it's annoying I might just delete this app and find a different one to listen to music on.
"I pay for premium but it will not let me save downloaded songs to an SD card. It just keeps moving them back. I go off grid a lot so this is very, very frustrating as I run out of space quickly. I'll change my rating to five stars when this is resolved as I have no other issues to note!"
I hate your ads it ruins everything
"I don't know if it's the latest update, but after skipping 3 songs Spotify stops playing in my car. Every other app with sounds works, but Spotify just stops and the play button turns gray."
"My review has gone down a star or 2 due to the recent bug in mine where (in a premium family plan) I've been getting to where I will hit a song in a playlist and evertime I click on any song it will skip down like 5 songs! It did this a couple of days ago and now it's doing it again! I even Uninstalled and reinstalled and it still isn't working properly, get yourselves together. I can't even listen to music properly anymore. Other than this I enjoyed the app, this kinda ruins it :/"
I like the app but there is one slight problem now and then I'll be listening to music on my headphones or just my phone and it randomly goes from Sami quiet volume to full on blasting music without touching the volume button and never had this problem with any other app. Using the s22 ultra
"If I could do 4.5 stars I would. It super annoying how easily you or just a messy screen can make you just instantly block songs. Like why is the button RIGHT BELOW ""add to playlist"" bruh for real put it at the bottom, or possibly only make it a little side button option. I have lost way too many good songs because of how close they are üò´"
Why dont you add slide gestures like in iphone? It makes the UX/UI way better on iphone and thats not fair!
It's a very cool app but what kinda gets me is there us no way to play the song you want due to there being only one button which is to shuffle
Too many choices demanding an immediate decision. Very difficult for someone trying to learn how to negotiate the procedure required.
"This most recent update will only play the first song, and then nothing unless you restart the app. I've been using Spotify for years and this is quite annoying."
"Need to move the like button somewhere else! I keep accidentally removing liked song from library, when I scroll or skip song."
deleting the feature that allows to add songs to your playlist quickly was ur worst decision. now it takes forever to add some songs to my playlist. thank you üòã okay in other hand this app is like... nice to use. even though now i can't even listen the parts of the songs to add in playlists like i did before.. üòî
It was working quite well but for the past few days the playlist of *liked songs* isn't opening and whenever i am searching for a song it shows *no results* and when i close the app and search the same thing again the results show can u pls fix this bug it's totally annoying me for the past few days
"I think that Spotify is amazing and I've been using for quite a while. Pretty much listen to all my music on here but I think that you should still be able to listen to your music in an order you choose, without premium because it just gives you a sense that you know what you are going to be listening too, especially if the playlist you have is a long one."
Its alright just wiah id quit getting ads of stupid rappers that dont know how to make good music when im a metal head
"No way of getting back old song lists or account after reinstalling if you forget password, On a Duo account this being the extra . Think it ,the app; should be programmed to regonise your device and guide you then on . Oh well roll on the future..."
Not sure what has changed on the app but I've noticed tonight that my play list now won't play every song on the list which as I have a playlist that is 55 hrs as I like a range of music it just plays maybe 20 songs then loops back. Please fix this cause it's quite annoying
"Is this what I have been paying for? When you listen to podcasts there is commercial every 10 min. I thought that my paid subscription is paid for this reason, to do not get a commercial every 10 min. It is so frustrating that I am about to quit and leave Spotify unitl it is fixed. Overall it is a good App but those ads every 10 min on paid plans are driving me nuts."
"I have been using free spotify for 5 months or so, and I use it a LOT. The whole day I am listening to music, and my experience has been mediocre. The main problem are little inconveniences while using the app. First of all sometimes the app says I am offline, but I am NOT. Second it keeps stopping my songs at random (its not my connection). The like button stops working some times. These reoccuring issues can be solved only by REINSTALLING the app. Which is really annoying."
"I'm an artist on this platform and because I choose not to pay for an upgraded account I wasn't allowed to simply click on MY song to listen to it, the Spotify system or algorithm or something forced me to listen to song after song after song of ""related music"" which is also a very flawed system. I'm an underground alternative hip hop artist and the songs I have posted on Spotify do not have any ""Pop"" elements...song yet I was forced to listen to mainstream pop for quite awhile before I gave up"
"I loved it for years, but recent ""updates"" have completely wrecked the user experience."
"I think that it is quite good, but the ads just make me dislike it a lot. Other than that, my only issue is no on-demand listening. It's a ridiculous idea, and makes me dislike them even more."
I feel frustrated by the frequency that I can not access the bar for play pause etc. Recently almost half of the time I wish to use Spotify. I will quit soon if I can find another way.
The background play is good but it always stop every song afterwards when I play Minecraft the song player in the quick panel suddenly disappears and there's always an ad every 10 songs and it's forcing me to pay for the premium trial and that bug/glitch causes my games to stop (even offline games)
"The app is okay, the UI is really bad for such a popular app. YouTube Music is a way better alternative in terms of interface and functions. The spotify phone app is basically useless if you don't buy premium, the subscription plan is overpriced and having to pay to skip a song is redicilous. The desktop app is better but still not the best, again the interface looks really outdated and basic for an app like this."
It's a good music app but there are always tons and tons of adds between the songs and it ruins so I prefer using Pandora or YouTube Music
"After reading the most recent reviews, I'm glad to see it just isn't me experiencing these glitches where Spotify just stops. I quite literally thought my headphones or phone was messed up. It's quite tiresome having my music stop suddenly or glitch out. And it's battery draining to keep my phone unlocked constantly, because that's the only time the glitch doesn't happen üôÉ. Anytime the screen times out is when the music suddenly stops or glitches and as soon as the screen is back up, it works."
Ads are very annoying it ruins all the fun of music
"What a way to ruin Spotify guys. Taking 2 features that were free (skipping tracks & listen to music in any order) and putting it behind a paywall. I uninstalled the app cause I can't listen to the music I enjoy the way I want to unless I give you money. Not cool guys, not one bit. And I've been with you guys for years too. üò°"
"I have not been a fan of many recent UI changes in the app, and I am opposed to Spotify's attempt to monopolize the podcast industry, but hey, there sure is a lot of music in here"
"Great app for my music, but one small problem. My songs glitch out and then get quieter for no reason. This makes me have to turn my volume up just to hear my songs and can be annoying. Other than that the Spotify is exceptional."
"The ad breaks have become far more frequent, and the opposite has happened to the 30 minutes of ad free listening. There are Ads EVERY time you open the app, and the ""learn more"" button regarding the ad appears inconveniently where the mini-player for the song is."
Spotify's complacency in the market has led to a buggy app and user experience. It's a shame that there is no serious competition that fits my needs because this app is so constantly glitchy. Luckily I'm good at quickly force closing and reopening it these days!
Spotify please fix this ‚Üì‚Üì So lately when I use Spotify and turn of my phone after 3 songs it turns the sound off and then quits me out the app its not the phone cuz it happened on 2 other phones aka my friends phones
"Used to love this app until just recently seems to have dropped off the rewind, fast forward and pause buttons. I'm a premium user and will be looking to find another platform if this isn't resolved. I see other users are having the same issue. Incredibly frustrating."
Whose idea was it to make the repeat button and navigation Bar on a song unavailable and only usable for a premium member?
"Where did the pause button go? I've used the app for over a year, mostly for listening to educational podcasts. Now, I can start playing, but the bar that allowed me to pause or stop is gone! What the heck? Prior to this, I'd have said 5 stars. Now, not so much. Hoping it's simply a glitch, and will be repaired on the next update, and soon!"
Can't able to see resume button in new update version. Help me out as soon as possible.
After the last update the app stops playing and doesn't show the pause button. Only way to stop is to force stop the app. Then I delete the cache. Then I restart the app. It's not my phone. I even tried deltwd all the data and have uninstalled and reinstalled it three times. This needs to be fixed. I pay for premium.
"I've been using Spotify for years, and I love it for the most part. After their recent update, however, the play/pause bar on the bottom disappears randomly multiple times throughout the day. It's super annoying and inconvenient, especially since you can't even pause using the button on wireless headphones when this happens. Strongly considering moving to a different music platform if this bug continues."
Its a great app and all but the thing is that i cannot choose the designated song i want from my own playlist and also how you cannot replay a song and have limited amount of skips in disturbing me a lot. I hope the moderators consider this.
This has always been my go to music app but now I can't see the stop pause and fast forward menu??? Literally can't stop what I'm listening to without quitting out of the app
"Nice selection however it is extremely annoying that due to the placement of my aux cord, my phone has to be upside down when in the holder and every other app will rotate, except for the ONE app that would make it safest to use the holder in the car. Will rotate sideways, but not full 180...please remedy, then 5 stars."
Love the app for functions/content. It's had a couple of bugs lately with 'currently playing' requiring shut down to bypass. And the continued support of Joe Rogan will keep the rating down.
Missing the equaliser and bass settings. When I play local audio files I experience the quality of sound is very mediocre. It would be best if you can add built in equaliser
still one of the best experiance music apps there enough adds at the time to keep it free any more would ruin the experiance
Quite expensive but fairly decent app
"Hey Spotify, fix the control bar and let my songs keep playing when my phone goes to sleep or I'm going to cancel my sub. This UX is currently untenable."
"I just downloaded this last week, but when i opened it now, the repeat button is gone. I tried to reinstall the app, still the same"
"App often won't show the play/resume/skip buttons while running, and drops out frequently."
Good content but the UI sucks.
"Have been a premium customer for years now and generally really enjoy the product but I had to come on and write a review here because the latest updates / versions of the app are infuriatingly buggy. The play / pause / fast forward / rewind buttons keep disappearing, making podcasts basically unlistenable. I keep having to delete the app and reinstall it, which works for anything between a few days to just a few minutes. It's incredibly annoying. Please fix what was a once great service."
Please add a Remove From Playlist button to songs that are currently playing from a custom playlist so we can filter our playlists as they play.
Ive been a happy subscriber for several years but recently the app has been extremely buggy. The playback will often times stop for no reason and also while listening the part of the menu that typically shows what's playing randomly dissapears which requires me to close the app if I want to rewind and leaves me no option to pause.
"It's got a great selection of music and podcasts but lately I've been having quite alot of issues with the app having alot of hiccups. Firstly, I'll be listening to a podcast or whatever and have no control panel for what I am listening to (the play/pause button, skip and rewind. It isn't there when I pull the control panel down and I can't seem to pause or skip when I need to. Secondly, my other issue is that the podcasts randomly pause for no reason and I have to repeatedly play it again"
"There is a prevailing issue with the play queue, a lot of times the app just decides to stop responding to the add queue feature, and then the music keeps shuffling. The show queue icon is greyed out. Also one of the most irritating issues is removing songs from playlists. To od that I need to touch the three dots on the side of the screen, however the three dots are so close to the side scrolling bar. So most of the times touching it just moves me 300 songs down on the list. Bad design."
Please add a not recommended button bcoz when i use Spotify there is a lot of innaproprate stuff And i do not like it so please make a not recommended button Or like stop these people
A few things with this last update not quite right. I dont know which playlist is playing anymore. Can't view the song that is playing either and it random stops.
"Premium user - playing button missing So I've been using Spotify for years but the new update seems to have messed the whole playing button and now playing up. It's disappeared and I can't see what I'm playing although music is playing out loud. Deleted snd re installed nothing, got rid of cache etc. Nada. Nothing working. Please sort this."
"Often glitches out so I can't see the player or control the current song. Music keeps going but there's no way to pause go to the next track or see what I'm listening to. Can choose new song or podcast but it's like the player window has disappeared. Can even go to the song in my library and hit the play button even though its already playing! This is a long term problem for me on multiple samsung devices, including new top of the line phone."
"Have been experiencing a lot of sudden stops while I'm listening to something. Or, if I want to pause or skip while something is playing, the toolbar is gone and I have to close the app and reopen. I have been a subscriber for years so its quite disappointing to see these glitches recently"
"Update: when it acts up, force quitting seems to fix things."
"The app is good of course.but there's one problem l faced in this app,it is possible neither save my favorite song to my playlist nor download it ,there is no any download button why?is it feasible?"
"I have had spotify premium for 6 years. For the last month or so, it has been awful. The buttons no longer appear for me to fast forward and rewind. I have Uninstalled and reinstalled it twice and same issue."
"As a person who doesn't have premium, I have a complaint about the ads. It tells me I will get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening, but 2 minutes later I get 2 ads in a row? It's quite annoying with the amount I get in general, I keep on getting 4 in a row and it can be really annoying when you're just trying to enjoy a bit of music and in between every 2 songs you get 2 ads"
"I love Spotify great app, but I honestly think the limited skips is ruining it because there's also a new update that shuffles it automatically and sometimes it plays songs I don't want to listen to at the moment and if I skip to many I have to listen to what they shuffle so maybe remove those two updates please other than that it's a great app :)"
"Great content but the UI is all over the place. Seriously, someone has to be fired. Spotify is the only app I have ever seen where UI gets progressively worse with each update."
"Really easy to use with tons of ways to organize your favorite songs, and a large variety of music to suit everybody's taste. Only problem is the amount of ads popping up during the actual listening which just distrupts the whole experience and it's not worth it to pay a unecessary fee."
"I was using the lite version then j installed this and i think that lite is better. The like button and skip are too close to each other, so it dislikes the song instead of skipping it and there is undo option for that u have search it again and also it crashes a lot. My phones literally telling me uninstall it bc of the crashesüòï. And sometines the player also dosent work and it dosent have background player like the lite versionüòê. I getting rid of this one, getting the lite versionüòß"
This is a very good service for laptops and desktops but the new updates are totally ruining the experience for mobile users and making it horrible. There used to be a kebab menu (three dots) icon whenever you searched a song which allowed you to add it to a playlist directly. Now you must play the song before adding it to a playlist because the three dots disappeared. Also mobile users don't have the option of rearranging the songs on a playlist. Please resolve these issues ASAP.
"Please change back the old insta story design, the new bold font design is so ugly. At least let us choose what design we want when sharing to insta story."
"Echoing the feedback from other premium users - the app was working perfectly fine until a few months ago. Now podcasts and music pause without obvious reasons, and some of the buttons disappear randomly. It's really frustrating."
"it is a great app but it has a skip limit time now and it does not have the shuffle button anymore it does it automatically and if I click on a song it takes me to a different song that is not the one I chose, I will like to listen to my playlist in pieces üò§"
"3 stars until I see an update to fix this issue. I love this app, I've been a paid subscriber for years, but for the love of God if I have ""unedited"" songs in my liked songs, Do Not! Switch them out for edited versions!...I'm 30 years old and if I wanted to hear the edited version of ""gin and juice"" I probably wouldn't be listening to r & b in the first place, please fix this has happened to me so many times!"
"the app is pretty ok but the newish design changes are annoying and intrusive. I just want all MY playlists in one place which doesn't need me to add filters or whatever. adding and removing songs is a chore and in general there seems to be a tendency to adding unnecessary and ugly buttons everywhere. Also, why is the basic menu laggy? do we need WiFi constantly to just pull up the tab to add or remove from playlist. The recommendations and compilation albums etc are very good though."
"this app was really good but the new update ruin the app, I just can play the song that I want for a second. please fix it, thanks."
I've been getting bugs. Pause button won't appear. The bottom thingy won't appear when I'm playing a song. I keep restarting the app but it doesn't fix it.
I like spotify but i hate that i can't just play my entire library without having to add songs to a playlist or like all songs. Can you just create a shuffle button to play all songs in a person's library?
"Generally fine. Not always as intuitive as the developers perhaps assume. Also hurry up and make a way to completely disable group sessions. If it's not something you want, the fact that someone in your group can change what you're listening to is very annoying. Especially when they don't even realize that they are doing it. See above for the app not always being as intuitive as developers assume"
Spotify has gotten much better than ever before. Great app and easy to use. Unfortunately they Censor quiet a bit of fact based political information like the X22 Report and Jordan Sather. But you can find them elsewhere
Won't show what's it's playing and how far you are into a song or podcast. Randomly stops when no ones pressed a button even with screen off üòí üôÑ
Gives a bit problem sometimes otherwise it's good and ads come very quickly
"There's no order to shuffling, you'll be listening to an up-beat song and suddenly an extremely depressing song comes on, it really ruins the mood. I'm sure if they can organize their playlists into upbeat and sad songs, they can organize their shuffling."
"UI glitches sometimes. The screen will get stuck and show the same thing even when I switch the song. Also app totally crashed when trying to move from internal to external storage, so I had to reinstall it"
"Sound is great, but someone can tell me how i find repeat button and how i can choose right song i want head"
Less than intuitive user interface.
Want better tamil lyrics in both english and Tamil. Sometimes autoplay song genre based on search is unrelated. Ad appearing in between two songs is quite hindrance
"I've been using this app for years and only recently decided to upgrade to premium. I was very excited with all the perks you get. The only downside to it however, is that for some reason I'm still getting adds whenever I listen to podcasts? Which I don't really understand? Because, you know, I'm PAYING for NO ads? I mean I can understand when you get adds from the person you're listening to cuz they're built into the audio. But I've heard the SAME adds in multiple podcasts. Kinda dumb right?üòë"
"Spotify have always been my go-to music streaming platform, but for awhile now does it consistently happen that the media control buttons doesn't appear in app or in notifications. I've tried to clear the app cache and tried to reinstall the app but nothing seems to work"
I dont know why the app is stuck right now. It does not open. Its for the first time since i am using. I have reinstalled it twice but nothing changed. It was ok before but idk what has happened. Plz guide me!!
"Its a great app but I genuinely hate the fact they took away to preview songs, And the ads have been getting massively out of hand. I get like 5-6 in between 2 songs."
"I suggest App developers reduce ads! It was too much and it made me quite angry when I only heard about 3 songs and the ad appeared while the ad said: ""You will be listening to music for the next 30 minutes"". It's a lie! But these songs are great! Only minus 2 stars because of Ads. ;))"
"Smooth app, but as of the left few days Spotify just freezes when I open it. Hope this is fixed soon! Also, a fast-forward/rewind button would be great!"
"I'm glad the pause button got changed back to where it was before. However, I've been trying to do this new super grouper thing, it glitches out when you search for an artist and no names come up (my internet has full bars so it's not that). I clicked off it to retry it a few times but it's completely disappeared now. So I have no way of taking part now. I love Spotify but at the moment I'm giving it 3 stars because every update has something buggy in it."
"I have been Spotify user for about 5 years now. I love the application on desktop and web but the mobile app is where it gets the 3 stars. ""Car View"" was a feature that existed up until 2021 where it was ultimately removed in November. This was a SIGNIFICANT FEATURE for users without the newer car play and android auto. This feature single handedly improved safety when driving as the buttons were big enough to press. This was not a good change."
"This app just to be fine With the latest update I keep getting disconnected no matter how close I am to my modem or how many signal bars I have, interrupting my songs 2 to 4 times per song. I can't even see what I am playing on the notification bar on android and I have not figured out how to see what I am playing in the app. This app just to be so intuitive and easy to use and now it's riddled with issues."
"Look, the apps functionality is great, I cannot think of a better music app, but the optimisation is very poor, whenever I open a playlist, the thumbnail won't load most of the times, if I play a song the thumbnail on the minimized player too won't show, most of the times!!!! I guess this ruins the experience of just using the app, so please fix this as soon as possible."
to be honest this app is very useful for gamers for many reasons but i only hate in this app is the ads about spotify premium and im teenager i dont have credit card to buy the premuim account so please dont make us watch ads.
"this used to be my favourite app - i'd use it every single day for way too long and rave about it. now spotify is just killing itself. the ui has gotten significantly worse, what with podcasts being continuously pushed in your face, and the extremely slow and buggy scrolling. i've been a premium listener for about two years, and my once astounding quality music has sounded dull, even with better headphones and many adjustments of the equalizer setting. that being said, i love this app"
please instead of shuffling through songs until we find what we initially searched for... make a play next button and let those other songs line up to play after the song we searched
"It's quite annoying sometimes because you can only skip 6 songs at a time and I can't find the song that I want . I have made my own playlist which has like 12 songs, after 5 or 6 songs it changes my playlist. It's unfair only 6 skips an hour having to wait as well as that I can't play a song I want from my playlist but I have to shuffle play. But apart from that, the quality of the songs are good."
"Usually great but recently the app has been bugging quite badly - I'll pause the music to do something outside of the app, and when I go back the control bar has vanished so I can't play, skip etc. Still have the bar in notifs but that stops syncing with what's playing so barely useful and even closing all, reopening the app & picking new song doesn't fix it, just now I don't even have notifs bar to control it. Really ruins the usability."
The UI malfunctioning in dark mode.
2 stars becuase its a way to listen to music when playing xbox but the amount of ads you get ruins the whole thing. 4 songs and then 6 ads is what i tend to get most the time. Im looking for alternatives so i can listen to music on my xbox without being bombarded with ads
"An amazing app for Listening music! Perfect quality and facilities! The only thing I didn't like bout this app is that we get a lot of advertisements which can ruin our mood for listening music üéß. So, the thing that i'd request them to change is 'stop putting a lot of advertisements."
"The app is fine. But it's been 2 years and they're still showing ads during podcasts to premium users. If you want podcasts, go elsewhere unless you don't mind ads despite paying over $10 Canadian. If you only want music the app itself is easy to use and pretty intuitive. I found the ads excessive without premium, but no where near as bad as YouTube."
"I found the app OK on consoles and pc but on phone the standards slip, it plays the songs on my playlist but when its done it plays songs that they added to my playlist and doesn't go back (yes I did turn off the autoplay button)"
"I don't know if y'all would answer the solution for this, but I've been utilizing this music source for nearly 2 years now, had enjoyed every single thing until the last update. Firstly, lot of songs I've played recently depicted a whole different track or album's cover, which made me hard to distinguish what song is. Secondly, specifically lastly, why do some songs have a lag, even if I've downloaded it? I've never experienced this before. Please fix this immediately."
I'm starting to think Amazon music better suits me. They play what I like without me choosing
It's a really good app to use while sleeping or when ur doing work but there are just UNLIMITED amount of ads. Like 1 song plays then there will be like 3 ads and that's just ruins the fun. Overall it's the best app to listen music!
Quite buggy and loads of ads
"This is quite a nice music app, well developed and well thought, but I hate it that when I navigate the app offline, even if I downloaded like 800 songs, I can't play none of them. Like, that should be the perfect ideal situation the download option was created for. Even after closing and reopening the app several times, my downloaded songs won't play. So the thing is, I'm wasting around 4 gb of space for nothing. At this point it's better to get Spotify Free and not the Premium version."
"Long time premium member. Spotify is part of my daily to and from work. There was a problem before with it shutting down when I was using my phone on other apps, the web etc. It seemed it was fixed and as of this morning seems it's back again. As a premium member I would hope this is addressed quickly so I can give it a better rating."
"it's a good app runs smooth simple ui and I've always used the solo premium plan but recently I did the family plan with 6 profiles and it was fine for a month or so but after that it changed my plan to the solo premium again, charged me 10 instead of 16 and canceled premium on my family's devices when I didn't change anything so that was my 1st bad experience with spotify"
Everything is great But ads are very irritating I know if iam not premium then ads will be there but insted of products and all you choose to ruin the moment which is not good It's kinda blackmail
"I've strong network connection but sometimes this app shows there is a network problem so that lyrics can't be load. Don't know why does it happens! And after 2 or 3 Times reboot, the app shows the lyrics, you know when you're looking for lyrics and lyrics aren't here, it ruins the mood"
Can the search be quicker? Maybe priorities musician then song title then lyrics last? Thank you for the service! May the Father of Heaven give you hope and a love and a knowledge of God. May you know the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to be faithful.
"i kinda hate this app now before it was great and when the updte came in its a whole new trashbag my issue is it stops randomly and there is no skip button when a 30 or 40 second ad came in and when i create a playlist for myself random songs just came in even if i didn‚Äôt added it but im still not gonna delete this app since its the only app that i can listen with but please fix it its forcing me to use premium even tough i have no money :""D"
"I have be on Spotify for quite some time. I downloaded the app to continue to listen to my music without having to be on my computer most of the time. As I'm writing this, I am listing through every Dean Martin album. But with the shuffle on, I CAN'T LISTEN TO IT IN ORDER. And I'm not buying premium since the free account is fine with me. But if you pushing me to buy it? Think again. Fix this BS please."
"Premium User here! I'd like you to be able to LOCK the darn queue, I mean everytime im building it up, ONE &$&%&@ slip and u skip through it! Like what was the point of it all? Also be able to view the lyrics without having to click the &$^@% songs...but maybe im just still heated about the other problem. Or add a 'build queue & make into playlist' feature. But please fix this queue thing...its janky and loose."
"no pause button. ever since the update on the 13th, my phone hasnt let me pause/ see what music im actually listening to. im not even able to pause the music without just completely restarting the app."
"I can no longer access my ""Likes Songs"" playlist. Also when I press on the ""heart"" ‚ù§Ô∏è button nothing happens, even the heart itself doesn't turn green üíö. Please help."
The play/pause button has been moved back to the middle. Thank you. Now I no longer have the buttons for changing the shuffle and repeat options.
"Fine for music, terrible podcast player (I'm a paid subscriber). I can't count the number of times I've had a podcast stop in the middle and either be marked played, or jump to another random episode. This has been going on for quite awhile now and has happened countless times on multiple devices. Too bad this is the only way to listen to Rogan."
"I refuse to rate this app well until there is as much polish on the Android app as there is on iOS. Please, Spotify devs, just bring the swipe to queue songs and the swipe gestures to close/open the now playing screen. Once this comes to Android I will be happy to rate 5 stars. Edit - quick queue added, improved rating."
"why did u get rid of the sort playlist button, it was my best friend üôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅ"
"The overall app is good....but one function that they can add and will really help... Will be that.. adding songs to queue just by searching them. By searching it , it just starts playing and ruins the whole queue we set .. So please add this feature too.üôèüèª"
I don't know who thought it was a good idea to move the pause/play button to the left and the skip buttons to the right but it just looks ugly
"Please stop adding songs to my Playlist. It's so stupid, just recommend them to me not ruin my Playlist. Please fix"
"Was loving the user experience until they updated the UI. I know it seems like a pretty thing to be annoyed about. Theyve put the buttons closer together and left empty spaces on the playback page making it really easy to what you want to hit. Also, would love it if they could add an undo button in case you accidentally remove a song from your liked songs playlist (which is really easy to do)"
The app is really good however free accounts have quite a lot of issues. For example it once played 15 (yes I counted them) suggested songs in a row before it continued with my playlist's songs and I could only skip only 6 of those
Spotify is great just lately there's a problem on android where if you go to open your notifications while the screen is locked it'll shift the lock screen player for spotify to the right and it becomes unusable. Sometimes force quitting the app will fix it othertimes I have to Uninstall and reinstall. Any permanent fix?
"Sorry I'm gonna give this 3 stars cause the update made it frustrating to use and there's no loop button anymore, so please fix this Spotify"
"Charges 10 fold for trial - $10 instead of $3/3 months being regular price; gets snagged after about an hour & won't play, & subtitles will not display on TV screen. Ah, now it's quitting after 10 min - via Cast. Yt, Netflix, Prime, Pandora, none have same issue"
"I mean, it's a great app to listen songs with but there are some issues going on. When I play songs, I couldn't rewind a certain part of it though I was able to a few days ago? Why is it that the shuffle buttons are gone like, the buttons where if you tap it, it'll replay the same song? This app is confusing, seriously. I just want to listen to songs that's it."
"Generally good, but local files are an absolute mess, they definitely need to get an update. Another thing that it's lacking in is more social features. Some big bugs and crashes occur quite often."
"The songs that I choose are entirely different, when I click the song I want to play it plays a different song but it still has the album cover with the play button but the song playing is different, hope you can fix this"
The UI is worsening with each update. The app feels slow. The semi-transparent titlebar at the bottom of the screen looks horrible. The artist image in artist pages often cut out the face of the artist for older artists. It doesn't even fetch the actual image sometimes - just loads a random album cover instead of it (although works in the desktop version).
Unstable ui in Android
"Not big on spotify but it's not too bad. Not as intuitive to navigate through as others and it's probably that, that means it's not my go to music app. My main one I find has all the same music, possibly even more, but is just easier to use."
"The ""Added to liked songs"" button stops functioning at intervals"
"Not sure if this is a glitch, but on the screen to play a song it has the pause/play button to the far left of the screen and the forward/backward buttons (the ones to switch between songs) in the center of the screen. Before, the pause/play button was in the center, between the other two."
It would be better if developers optimize this app for andriod Devices as i have seen there's no problem in ui and music quality in apple devices but when comes to andriod it has laggy ui as well as not so good music quality..
Best music and podcast app out there. Large selection of music and very intuitive interface. üòÅ
"I always hook up my phone to the Xbox so I can listen through my headphones as I play but the problem is that I have it set to full volume and it's still quiet. I tried seeing if there was any settings I could use to change this but it's only on mobile, not Xbox"
Please fix the latest update. I cannot play any song. It keeps on crashing once I click play button. Device: VIVO V21 Location: PH
"App works but it's a bit slow, doesn't always load when I try and fast forward a song, it also takes quite a long time compared to the app for iPhone. S21fe."
"Can someone please explain this: this only happens when i connect my pc to my phone so I can easily switch songs, the queue button dosnt work but my biggest issue is with the fact that when I connect my pc to my phone it updates its settings to match mine and keep in mind that my setting are exactly the same on pc and phone so explain why the hell I'm getting my phone recommendations in my pc Playlist this has never happen on pc but it's only when I connect to my phone for control."
What happened to the enhance button on my liked Playlist? It just disappeared I restarted my phone even losing in and out of my account reinstalled the app and its no where to be found
"It's good app, all the songs but the glitching, u have change the song amd then play it again to, (it's sooo annoying) if u accidentally touched that something like - button, the song won't play again no matter what u do try to search and listen or uninstall or something but it won't play, this is the really disgusting feature which is of no use, just a problem"
been using spotify for quite long..but i have a problem when i want to pay for my premium..even after i check everything and re install the app again
"I like spotify, you can look for any genre and artist or Playlist but what I hate is that I can't turn off shuffle mode which is very annoying. please do something about that, I searched for a shuffle button in the apo but could find it, on Google it says that the shuffle button is near the ""now playing"" bar but I can't seem to find it :("
"Great app, sadly since quite a while it is not possible to get a list with all the songs of an interpret of choice... Only the top 5 songs. Why is there no ""show all songs"" button :( And no I don't want to shuffle the interpret to get all songs in the queue."
The app itself offers the best user experience of music apps in my opinion and most likely has the largest library of music. The problem is the fact that Spotify Premium advertisements are pretty intrusive if you're on the free version and the ads between songs are quite annoying.
"I like Spotify a lot, but it started adding songs to my Playlist that I dont know, like, or want on my Playlist. I tried hiding all of them but it gave me more of them. U also can't remove them. The reason I found this is b/c I was playing through my Playlist and a song I dont like started playing. I went to look on my phone and it had added a ton of random things. Please don't tell me to undo the enhance, b/c I dont have an enhance button anymore.i had one last night and did not press it."
Spotify is good but can i have a request that when u pick a song theres a download button so u can listen without internet
"It's great! Tons of music to listen to. But, it'd be better if it didn't had different songs playing when I want to listen to my favorite song. It's a bit annoying but great app!! I gave this a 3-star rating since everytime I'll skip it keeps saying ""You've got a new feature!"" I thought pressing the get 1 month free button will stop it from appearing, it's so annoying. Edit: it also wastes my free skips."
I've had to lower my rating because lately the app is getting worse and worse. You seem to prioritise minimal UI over functionality. Main issue I'm having is that my playlist which has 48 hours worth of music in it will start repeating songs an hour or 2 in to playing through BT speakers (yes repeat is off) and then often switches to playlist radio which I don't want!
"I'm having a trouble listening to music lately Spotify is shutting down on its own whenever I press play button,i tried everything from uninstalling the app to trying various methods to get rid of this bug . My app is also updated .I even tried few times logging out of my account and logging back in (I even tried to make a new account) but i just can't listen to music anymore pls let me know if there's any other way of getting rid of this problem. Thank you üòä."
It's an incredibly uinintuitive app on every device it's different and I cannot find what I'm looking for easily. When you have to google how things work on spotify is not a good indication. The UX designers need to do a better job :(
App is crashing when play button is pressed after update
The interface feels quite non-intuitive
Absolutely loved the app until the latest update. They separated the shuffle function from the play function and now it I have to remember to also press the new shuffle button. Otherwise it only plays one song over and over. Unfortunate..would have been five stars if it was still the old way.
The app is perfect for listening but but but....the ads are too problematic plus the shuffle button isn't available
It would be the best the thing I don't like when I double tap the sound button the music starts automatically that mades me go angry but the features are the like all
"It was initially good (and still is), but now on free they're playing ads for every 3 or so songs, and they've removed the three dots that show up next to songs when searching. Since how I listen to music involves adding songs from search to queues or playlists I am forced to switch to a different service. Is otherwise very good. Decent quality, good UI. Large repository of songs. Extremely good recommendations based on listening history. Has a local files section and some very useful settings."
paid customer since 2015. Latest Android update broke something and now Spotify quits all the time when using other apps like Waze and Lyft Driver. What happened?
"A few UI changes need to be made, more bugs need to be fixed and a few network issues still need to be addressed. Overall a pretty good app except they of course need to pay artists more for THEIR work."
Why why have you changed the ui to something so so stupid I still don't understand the pount of having this non intuitive layout please make the buttons go back to last song-pause- next song this new orientation is plain annoying
"love the app overall but It would d be highly appreciable if u could bring back the Spotify preview button. One of the best features of Spotify so far and it shouldn't be removed, making playlists and discovering new songs was pretty much fun and easier earlier. Hope you fix this problem soon!"
I have had Spotify for quite a Weiland overall am happy with my experience. Why are my podcasts playing backwards all of a sudden? Super annoying
For months now spotify's Podcast have been messed up. It marks my Podcast played when it's nowhere near done. You can't access the play and pause button so sometimes it just restarts and you can't get back to the place you were.
"The app is very intuitive and it also have a big library of songs and podcasts in all languages but at a cost, the max audio quality is not hifi lossless. I stayed with Deezer because of its hifi lossless quality. Well until you guys add hifi lossless then I'll come back."
I can't listen to the songs I downloaded offline it requires my data to be on for me to able to enjoy my favorite tunes .. that's a major concern honestly . Fix this Spotify or you'll lose subscribers
"I don't know if it's a glitch or a feature in testing, but my pay button is way on the left side with the skip buttons on the right. Please I want it back to normal. Rewind , play, skip."
love to make my own greatest hits sets . I wish I could still get the quick music sample so I can see if I want to add song to my play list. I will give 3 stars in stead of my previous 5
"So many bugs and glitches, slow UI, some very annoying ads."
"Desperately needs a ""Replay from start"" for podcast episodes. I love relistening to my favorite podcast episodes, but if I select an episode I already listened to it will often automatically skip to the next episode too quickly for me to manually rewind"
"I don't like the new design of the player. I love the old design where the play/pause button (defaultly) in the center, not on the left side of the player. The new player design looks stupid. Hope you bring back the default play/pause button on the center like it used to be."
Its great but i hate that when you dont have premuim IT PLAYS A RANDOM SONG LITTELRY DONT KNOW! STOP DOING THIS I WANT TO LISTEN TO MUSIC THAT I HAVE IN MY PLAYLIST WITHOUT PRIEMIUM. AND A TOP OF THAT 4 ADS THAT ARE 30 SECONDS LONG?!
"They changed how to play songs from a playlist/album. I do not need another play button for the current song. Before I was able to push play and it would start the album from the first song, now it just continues the song I was listening to the last time I was on the app. If I wanted to play that song, I would have clicked the play button on that song, not the album. Seems like an unnecessary change that makes it harder to restart/listen to a playlist."
"I am in love with this app, higly recommend it. Although the past few months the app has been slow to load, regular crashes and some features stop working smoothly. The new layout with the play button on the left is awfull and aesthetically irritating. Other than that, it is a great streaming service."
"The newest update is the saddest. How can you put the play button on extreme left? & put prev and next button in such close proximity. Change is design is good but this doesn't make any sense guys. Being a designer myself, my thumb shivers everytime I see that screen. Please go back to normal. Even interms of whatsoever ergonomics, those 3 key things (play/pause, prev, next) together are a disaster. Pls switch back to the previous design. Bring the play button to the centre. Pls Spotify peeps."
It was my favorite Intel it got an update I only have 6 skips and I can't put songs on loop anymore. This update ruined it please fix it
"Please change the play, skip and back button to how it used to be"
Ive always had countless ui problems with this app but with that said it will always be my main music platform. I just love the look and the layout of it.
"Great for the most part, but when attempting to sync with other devices - be that a computer, smart home device or similar the interface both lags and sometimes stops working altogether on the mobile app - requiring to force restart the mobile app to get it to re-sync."
Songs get stop and has bug when tap on Play button!
I wish we could use the skip button without a fee and play a song not the entire album
"I've been using Spotify for quite sometime now and I do like, it's not a bad app to say but sometime when I try to pick a song to play I get something completely different and get annoying everytime and I don't know if it's like that or not but I do want to know if it's like it. Aside from that it's a pretty good music app."
Got good music on there but when I don't want to listen to that song it wouldn't let me skip it when I had not touched that button for well other 2 hours
"Album art is frequently missing from areas in the UI, especially the minimized control bar. Also starts playing automatically when connected to Bluetooth even if it was not open or is not the selected input on the device. A setting to disable auto play on Bluetooth connect would be helpful."
"The Spotify version 8.7.30.1221 is very bad , you all have put this play pause button into the left , earlier it was in the middle part, please make it correct"
App quite working after last Samsung update on 5-13-22. Not happy had all my music with you and have nothing yet. Before this I have been very happy andno thinking of upgrading. But if I can't depend on you I will have to look elsewhere.
I enjoy the app but the inconveniences are annoying. Why is there no button to turn off shuffle on Discover Weekly?
The new UI with the Play/Pause button on the left side is the most unintuitive layout to have. Bring the OLD Button layout BACK!
"The shuffle button is NOT working, Spotify will play the same song more then 3 times in one day."
the shuffle functionality is really bad. sorting by genres is a quick fix but not very helpful. Too many duplicate songs. Why is this allowed?
I mean it is top tier with regards to delivery but they can do so much more. . the UI bugs annoy me and plenty other things like tye support team whatever are so unresponsive it succks :(
"Placements for the play/prev/next button on far left, it's ugly"
"I am unable to connect through internet when I am searching song but songs which were added into liked playlist are streaming fine. Hope, need a quick support over this."
"Uhm what? I've been using Spotify for over 5 years and today while I was listening to my music I noticed that the ‚èÆÔ∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚è≠Ô∏è button layout have changed and personally I do not like it at all. I do not know whether it is a glitch or something that can be fixed, but please return it back to normal as it looks like this now ‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚èÆÔ∏è‚è≠Ô∏è. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
Moving the play and skip buttons was a bad move. There's no reason for it. It's unnecessary
why is play/pause button on the left side instead of in the middle for android phones?
"The app requires premium to be free of ads, and it also requires premium to play a song you choose without it being in a playlist."
"The good things about spotify were probably already said by other users so let me review the negative side. Sometimes i feel uncomfortable while using this app because when i listen to music it suddenly stop and i had to go back open the app and check why is it stop and i need to click the pause/play button so i could continue listening the music, after i updated the app it lagging a lot!! and sometimes the lyrics won't show upüò© please fix the bugs & keep up the performance of the app."
"Still nice, but the user experience is declining. Deprecated support for JVC (aftermarket) radio is absolutely unacceptable. Youtube has a better user experience in terms of discovering new music, how come the Spotify algorithms keep missing the mark?"
"Been listening to Spotify for a couple years now and the adverts are just a nuisance. What is the point of a song then a minute of ads after each one? Bit of a money grab going on lately, not impressed. Other than that, it's an ok app but going downhill as time goes on."
"Seriously needs better play/pause controls and driving friendly UI. I could not find the pause button for the life of me, very dangerous!"
A Spotify button integration in tiktok would be super fire... We can play viral songs right from the tiktok app.!
I love Spotify but lately there have been a lot of bugs where Spotify will shut down out of no where and just stop playing. Also sometimes the play button at the bottom disappears so you can't pause. I would give it 5 stars before all of this started happening.
"So i love spotify and I love making playlists but there's been one thing that has been making me want to combust. I can't listen to a little preview of the song. The little play button on the album image is gone and its driving me insane. I find no joy in making playlists anymore, and it's inherently difficult now. This app was amazing before you threw an amazing feature away. Please, bring it back"
"Something broke in the recent update. I have shuffle enabled, but I can't actually shuffle my own playlist. I have to manually select a starting song and then it decides to shuffle. Before I could click the play button and it would auto shuffle, but now it won't."
"I think something broke in the app, as the play/pause button is suddenly off to the left side instead of in the middle of the back and forward buttons. It looks really really weird, though at least the buttons still with correctly I guess???"
A lot of app issues From time to Won't react to play/pause/stop. the bar disappears and from time to time can not be controled from my Jabra earbuds. To stop sometimes you have to exit the app. The UI is not intuitive. takes time to understand. Difficult to find the recent played songs.
Had to downgrade to 3 stars. What happened to the preview play button. Need to check what I am adding to my playlists
"Hi, The app freezez while my music is still playing or it doesn't respond to nex/previous song buttons, therefore in giving 3 stars instead of 5"
"Ive never had problems before with Spotify, but recently, i don't know if its my phone or the app, but everytime i try to listen to music or a podcast, it just stops in the middle of a song and then continues. It happens like 3 times for each song, and it does it on my aux and headphones. It also does not appear on my lock screen like before, idk what i have to do in my settings to activate that. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, but i still dont know if this is a phone issue or Spotify."
6 ads in a row. I hate this so much and it ruins the mood completely
I love the app but having a Playlist that is 3 hours long and only having it play the same 10 songs repeatedly is quit annoying.
"Due to ads üòñ giving less star. Just imagine you are thinking about someone and listening songs, Yes that person üòè And then ad comes ruining your mood. Haha but I won't mind it actually, because it helped to make a playlist with someone together üôäüòÅ Sooooo that's good one"
I want the button for the new songs in 24 hours üôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇ
App back navigation is not good. When I press back button it's show lot of screens.
"I love the experience on this app, but with Premuim it gets better... The only problem is that I can't see or access the Lyrics Feature, Lyrics don't work on my phone (SM A03 Core), This is is big problem."
i cannot find the repeat button it just have the block song i tried everythinf went to yt but they have the repeat button please give me advise on how to fix it ü•≤
You know I really using this app 'cause you can almost find any songs you can think of. But... I don't know if anyone else noticed it the recent updates they changed the spacing of the lyrics it used to be quite wide. But now it looks squishy especially when playing Japanese or Korean songs I feel like I'm reading essay in the lyrics because it's so freaking narrow. I don't know what you're thinking but please give the users of the freedom to changed their prefer appearance of lyrics settings.
"Its a good app I use it almost every day, but there was an update that made the preview of the song disappear when you use the add to playlist button. Also a lot of the ads get repetitive and annoying( but i do know i can just buy premium so take the ad complaint with a grain of salt)."
"Please bring back the ""Shuffle"" button! I'm fed up of my playlists starting at the beginning and playing the same songs over and over. I don't give a stuff about Adele's demands. Not everyone is a fan of her depressing music!"
"If you want to listen to a song, and u press the play button, the previous song plays and it is so frustrating. On a laptop or computer it's better"
"I am having many problems with your app and I hope you fix it soon, please, since in a while if it continues I will cancel my subscription it stops taking time to connect or it doesn't let me move the quiet commands from the screen and that annoys"
Please bring back quick preview songs for free users.
Wonky unstable unintuitive badly organized app. Definitely could use some improvement.
Mostly good. UI needs some work to streamline it.
"Im using spotify (premium) for several years, but last months it's getting really painful. It's just sooo slow, just to start the app takes 15 seconds, transition between online to offline mode or back is very slow. I also hate redownloading the songs, as it does for some reason. I love the broad music library, but the user experience is getting really bad. Im using also YT music, their app works just fine and swiftly."
These ads!!! Every two songs I get 4 adds. This is insane. This is the most simple listening platform and yet it gets ruined by its nonstop ads
It's a really great app. I love how fast they update the songs and playlists and all that but a dislike button would be nice. So that when songs are disliked there not only remove from playlists and also not suggested in another playlists.
Continues to crash. Cant go more than a few minutes before my music stops. Upsetting. Thanks for continuing to fix the problems with this app. Otherwise love it!!!
Longtime user of the app but my only concern is the pausing during playing of songs which requires you to restart the app please fix it....
"Listening to music on the app is great. Good ability to bring up channels related to artists and band is awesome. However, it is horrible to browse and find podcasts. All around the app design is just terrible."
The iPhone version is much more user friendly with guestures compared to Android where everything requires you to do a one more step to do what u want
"I would give much better due too the song I like in there but only had a small window to listen to stuff the I couldn't so that's a problem in my case, but my guess would be it's for the money, all I'm saying is it ruined my experience with Spotify"
"Brilliant but it costs more than it should. Two bucks a month at the most is what it should be , making it a genuine tool worth keeping for life's journey üòÅ"
I app is glitchy. It seams lazily made though maybe it's much harder then I think to make an app like this. Often the bar at the bottom of the screen that is used to pause or skip a playing song isn't there (this is a new issue) and I have to restart my phone or delete the app to stop it playing. If I am playing a play list on random and switch devices it seams to restart the random and very quickly play the same songs I just heard. The recommendation algorithms are way off.
"Well, spotify is good but one of the stuff just gets on my nerves. The problem that I have with it is that I can't even fine the damn shuffle button and sorry for using the word damn but it's the baby who keeps crying which makes me annoyed. But I can't seem to find it and I want to have my songs play in order."
"Works alright most of the time but I don't know what it does with downloads. They keep disappearing. Also, I get logged out when there's no network. It's let me down a lot in no network areas. Fix the offline mode issue for the other two stars. Quite annoying."
Can you guys fix this app in such a way that i can download a single song without necessarily downloading the whole album which i only need one song from?. By the way it's a nice app but pls consider a download button for a single song.
"really disappointed with the removal of song preview feature in search and suggestion bar for free plan user why took something insignificant for you yet so useful for the users? what's the benefit out of it other than ruining the whole experience I know you guys trying to encourage people to buy premium plan but this is just too much, why can't have a little fun with just a song preview feature?"
"I like the app, it is probably the best way to listen to music. One thing that is annoying is that one or twice every month, my downloads delete themselves. This may not sound that bad but I have over 100 podcast episodes downloaded and there is no mass download button for podcast, so I must click download on every single episode. I'm still not sure what causes the app to just delete my downloads but it's very infuriating."
"The 3 stars are for the service Spotify provides (daily mixes, blends, radios etc) but honestly the android app has been quite horrible lately, lagging all the time, there's always a delay between what im listening to and whats displayed, recently i can't even open the app it would stay at the HP with the spotify logo it's frustrating"
"I could given five but now, I've released how hard it is to use the Spotify. Especially when it comes to opening an Artis account, it really hard. I've tried it many times but it seems impossible even Spotify Technical support is not the best, not helping at all. Otherwise it quite simply to find and stream on it, that's what I can only recommend for people."
MAJOR drop in quality over the last couple of years. The biggest being the recent changes to the UI/UX. I wish I had the right words to describe what upsets me so much. I am just so disappointed in the poorly thought out and executed changes that I've been looking for other platforms to stream my music.
Still shows me podcasts but at least it can play music when I press the button now.
"Downloaded to access some of the podcast that moved to Spotify. Using mostly Google podcasts expected a much more user-friendly experience. Too many bugs, no way to easily manage queue and unclear episode list view just isn't working for podcasts. Should have its own properly designed view specifically for podcasts."
"Very useful app, everything's nice; UI, sound quality, music collections, music discover features. But why song preview feature was removed??? I need it to make new playlist with new music to discovered. Bring it back!! Also pls fix the bugs. „Ö†„Ö†"
"There are times that when I'm listening that it won't let me pause it. It just shows the play button even while it is playing. I have updated, deleted, reinstalled, force closed and all. Still a problem. Other than that, I love the app."
Its a good app but there not enough skips and i can't pick which one I want (on mobile) and it shuffles every time but on a computer you can pick and theres a separate button for shuffling.

"Spotify is either reading my brain waves or straight up eavesdropping on my conversations. Way before I opened the app, my school played here comes the sun in the speakers, and that's what Spotify played, and this same thing has happened multiple times. Bruh, just quit and set up an option at least. Thieves."
"It suddenly just stopped my plalist from playing properly/the right order, also it is now different then it was yesterday, and not in a good way. I can't change the order of my playlist and it keeps glitching and only playing like a fraction of the song, it might be because it wants me to go an dbuy premium or it wanted me to write this review. This app is quite fiddly, but you can still listen to songs easily if that's what your looking for"
"Good for listening to music, but it doesn't play the song I want to play. I go to my playlist, press the button that plays the playlist, and it plays some classical symphony. Please fix this."
Slight changes made in the interface graphics made it worse. Was way better and classy before.
"Why you make this so hard. Random and regular play should always have a small button to choose... It should be possible to unlike all kind of musics, so the algorithm get more accurate in which musics we like more or less. And a small button to block all artists or musics we do not like at all... Why i need to listening boring pop music for instance... You should need to pay attention to costumers insted orther marketing publicity..."
It has been acting up on me lately. On my laptop it will show me a black screen and on my phone if I get a notification it will stop playing. And sometimes it won't show the play button when I'm playing a song. But it used to work really well bidk what's up with it now. Please fix
"My app won't automatically play music when I get in the car anymore. I have to open the app, go to my playlist, and press ""next song"" button to make it play. It won't even play if I just press the play button. I actually have to press next song (or previous song). Using S22 Ultra."
I used to could be able to preview songs why all of a sudden I can't anymore that ruins finding new music and I basically wasted buying premium üôÉ which is a minus. I don't recommend this app anymore to anyone.
"The Quality and Quantity of the music is great but have been having this bug; where it says nothing is playing but you can still here the musicüòï, and can't interact with things like the pause button. Would also like to be able to see how long a song is (without playing it - like on a playlist down the side) on phones & Tablets as there is no setting to make it show up. Thanks for a great music appüéß. Recommend if willing to pay."
"The music selection in this app is really good, however this app is absolutely terrible at recommending and/or discovering new music. It seems to prioritize genres/artists/songs that you listened to 1 time and completely disregards all of your favorite artists in its algorithm. I've never gotten a good recommendation from Spotify. It's due to this fact that I would recommend other music streaming apps, who do a much better job at personalizing the user experience."
"Last 2 days since recent update it will stop on and off during songs. Today, started playing and it shows it still playing, but it's not. Hitting pause does nothing and I've tried all suggestions online and from Spotify community. Uninstalled. Restarted phone, which is an Samsung Note 20 Ultra, UI 4.1, Android version 12, latest update March 31 2022. Nothing seems to be rectifying the problem."
"Too many minor issues for the market leader. Playback stops without reason, especially in Podcasts, playback works fine but controls disappear so app has to be force stopped to get them back. The thing were you pick a song on a play list and then jumps to another random track as you click out of Spotify! None of these are terrible but they collectively damage the user experience and should have been fixed."
"App is good... when it works. I store my library on an external SD card which has caused a few problems. One of which is extremely infuriating. When choosing where to store my library, I see three 'SD Card' options. Which do I choose? And recently, Spotify has decided to randomly un-download my entire library 3x. As someone who has limited wifi data usage, these extra 15gigs aren't something I consider to be acceptable. Considering I pay for this service, I'm quite disappointed in the quality"
Love this app for 6 years butbits starting to become bug-gy. My Spotify continuously crashes meaning I have to set up music multiple times while working which is annoying but I've had the app for years and don't really want to switch. I also find podcasts are great but the app is not designed for podcast listening and hoards your previous plays meaning you need to manually undownload or get rid of podcasts you've listened to which sicks for podcasts but is awesome for music. Many pros to Spotify
Music is life. Love the selection of playlists. I'm updating my review. The pause button keeps disappearing then I have to uninstall the app to stop the music. Come on Spotify sort it out
"App recently has a lot of bugs, including randomly pausing or disconnecting. Also when I take out headphones randomly stsrts, playing on my phone and app has no pause button"
The best. But I do hope you guys create an light mode option for the ui
"It's an awesome app but recently I've been experiencing a lot of crashes, music stopping halfway, the play and pause buttons keep disappearing"
"I have to keep Uninstalling to stop the music. Connects great to blue tooth head phones and my car with ease, however once I'm done or need the music off I can't find the pause or stop button... the only option is to turn the volume down or change the song."
"Can't see the play bar,can't skip songs and have to close the app the turn off my music. Not a great user experience at the moment"
"This update on the pixel android software is a nightmare, I constantly have to quit the app and reopen to get the basic functions working. The playing bar down the bottom won't show up neither will the playing preview in the drop down on my phone so I have no way of playing or pausing the music. I love spotify so I'd love an update to fix this"
"As of late this app has had the most annoying random pause or full out crash during podcasts. It will continue to play on my phone once I've left the car, with no pause or stop features available. I use to close all running apps to get it to shut down. Completely unacceptable for a service I pay for. I'm seriously considering discontinuing my subscription."
"Play bar constantly disappears, requiring a force close. Plays wrong songs, example: I press on Fat Lip by Sum41 and it plays In Too Deep by Sum41."
Hello I was wondering if you's are ever going to fix a problem that's been happening for quite sometime now probably it came with the update but apparently it's not showing the bar where you have control of pausing and skipping the music it shows the soundtrack at the bottom of the app when you play a song and when I come back it just suddenly disappears instantaneously. Hopefully you's fix it. I tried uninstalling and restarting my phone and it still does the same thing it disappears.
"i deducted two stars since there are way more ads in the free plan than they promise and their shuffle feature always messes up repeating the same songs which is really annoying but its still the best music listening app by far due to the library, quality, interface, etc. just some very minor technical problems like the play/pause button glitching in app sometimes and becoming a white circle but nothing earth shattering and these also only occur if your device is a old one like mine."
"The interface has some troubles on the pixel 5, the upper menu and the search bar places itself on the upper part of the screen, right behind the front camera hole, which makes its difficult to press some buttons and sometime to read the information."
Great app but playback buttons disappeared recently. Otherwise great app/platform and I'd definitely recommend pro!!
I'm paying 12.00 a month for this app service and for it to be bugging out not happy at all don't appreciate my music stoping randomly for no reason also where is my play pause button! Horrible this needs to be fixed ASAP or I'll be cancelling this subscription
"Plz fix lag. I close the player AND the app but i still hear the song. Why?! Plz fix quickly, then i change rating."
"Spotify did work brilliant but recently I have been having issues. When I play music or a podcast the pause button has disappeared and it appears on the interface as if nothing is playing. It the randomly stops and if I press play music/podcast go back to the beginning. Also, if I am connected to a device via Bluetooth and then disconnect music/podcast carry on playing through my phone and the only way to stop it is to quit the app. Very frustrating."
"Getting really annoying how this app will turn itself on in the middle of Bluetooth calls or just has stupid random glitches constantly, like the pause and play button will dissappear but the music keeps playing and you can't stop with out force quitting the app"
"Such a bad experience for a big companies app. It seems with every update they break something else. The ""now playing"" bar keeps dissapearing while music still plays and the ""like"" button refuses to change colour to show a song has actually been liked. I've had three different devices and have always encountered small problems like this."
This was literally my only sourceof escape but the recent bugs are killing me... i cant see what song im listening to and I can't pause it. when i close the app it still plays. This kinda sucks... ü§® pls fix it. Ruins the whole vibe.
"Spotify has always been quite the reliable app, but recently it has been anything but. A recent large update seemed to create a lot of bugs that can't be ignored. Music would stop randomly when I lock my phone, when leaving the app running the player would sometimes not show up forcing me to restart the app to get it back and sometimes a different song would be playing than what it shows in the player. Not exactly the premium experiance I was promised...Hope at least these bugs get fixed soon"
"How do I keep Spotify from adding algorithm chosen songs to a playlist on mobile? I make playlists where I only want a specific list of songs, but when I leave for a bit during a build and come back later I find that Spotify added like 20 songs and I can't find the option to remove them (and it'd be frustrating and tedious to sit there and remove one song at a time). I don't want the songs that the algorithm is adding on the specific playlist so how do I make them stop"
"I love Spotify, but the most recent updates disturb my listening habits extremely. Music randomly stops playing and I can't turn it back on because there is no play button. Sometimes the app freezes and I have to close it, open it again so my phone tells me that Spotify stopped working and then I can open it again. Also I can't queue more than one (1) song anymore and it's annoying. I don't want create endless playlists just to have a flow of songs. Please fix these issues, I love your library."
It's a good app but downloading songs shouldn't be a premium luxury As a broke student with no income its an inconvenience not to be able to listen to music offline
Love spotify and loved the app until the last update. Been having alot of bugs where I loose some controls over the app with my headset and the controls disappear in the notification bar. Have to close the app and re open it. It makes it quite annoying to use at work. Could be somthing to do with android though. But my buddy with a completely different phone is having identical issues. Will change the review once it's resolved.
"The new update has a nice UI, but the 'playing song'-display bugs and doesnt show up"
"Spotify was a solid app until the last few builds. Now, it crashes randomly, doesn't display player controls if I have it running in the background and call it up again, skips ahead a few seconds if I try to minimize it, and will start playing in my car even if I don't have the app open. I've had to force stop the app and clear the cache way too often. When it works, it works well, but that's becoming more the exception than the rule"
"These latest bugs have made the app unbearable... app crashes ocassionally stopping the music or it doesn't show the music currently playing, requiring me to close it and open it up again, which then stops the whole experience."
Pause and stop buttons keep disappearing meaning I have to uninstall the app to turn music off.
"I've switched to android from using this on ios for 2-3 years, the android version is poor by comparison. I'll play a playlist and there's no UI showing what's playing. Have to close a reopen the app to get the play banner along the bottom to reappear."
"I love this app, but recently it started to malfunction: when I want to play a song from the beginning (or previous song) and I push the button ""previous"" it just doesn't work"
"Quality is decreasing with every update. Quit pushing podcasts on me, and simplify the app. It's buggy and slow now where it used to be snappy and a pleasure to use."
"I'm sure it's known by now but the player disappears and a forced quit is required to get it back. Android Galaxy s20 here, with whatever the latest Android os is called."
"There are bugs in the app. UI is also not too friendly, and i would like u to look after these things - 1) songs in a playlist could not be arranged 2) history cannot be deleted 3) there is no option of add to queue when we search for songs 4) last played song could not be closed."
"I've been using Spotify premium for years, its very easy to use and very convenient but these day it started to lagging quiet a lot and took time to open the app which makes me felt kinda frustrated about it. At first I thought it was my internet problem but then other app that required internet connection works perfectly fine. I happened to see other spotify users review, seems like they also face same thing like me. I hope it will be fix soon."
I've loved Spotify for a while now and its a great app it just doesn't.. work sometimes. My playlist won't update and it says it only is 27 hours long when I know it's way more than that. Songs also won't do the preview thing anymore when I press Edit playlist. The play button isn't even there. :/
"Since update on 5 Apr, the app has been playing up. For example, the stop button disappeared, only shows the play button. This means I can't control the play from my headphones"
"I use this app all the time and overall I'd recommend, but it's a bit buggy of late, seemingly after every android update. Pausing during tracks like it's buffering, control buttons disappearing, refusing to pause or shut down. Reinstall of the app usually fixes it, but no one wants to be doing that every time and all tracks are forgotten when you do"
"The app always has at least 1 bug whenever I run it, for example: ‚Ä¢ The banner at the bottom of the screen which contains the play button and name of the song disappears whenever it wants ‚Ä¢ Music randomly stops playing ‚Ä¢ The app refuses to open or it plain crashes when I'm running it ‚Ä¢ Some of my friends send me songs but when I click on the link it still doesn't open up in the app Most of the time when I have these issues all I need to do is reset the app but lately that doesn't even work."
"latest update is causing a lot of glitches. I've seen several reviews saying the same things. play bar/overlay doesn't appear, have to force quit the app several times to get it to appear, and the random pausing started with this update too. fix it please!"
Hello! Thank you for not removing the storage selection settings. I suggest having Play Next button/option.
Recent update with new UI changes has made the app substantially unstable to the point the app crashes while the phone is locked then tries to play music with no input or display of music player on the Spotify app
Exceptionally glitchy with a UI that is subpar/lacking when compared to alternative options. Forget attempting to switch music on this app while in motion. It's a total nightmare with how cluttered and unintuitive it is.
This app in the past few updates has ruined the experience in certain ways. Using Bluetooth specifically has become a problem and rather cumbersome. The app crashes a lot while connected to my vehicles multimedia system or even a Bluetooth speaker with any kind of controls.
"Latest version is buggy and crashes, the now playing bar often disappears, and controls are not visible from android home/lock screen and notification bar. I have to force stop the app to stop audio playback at times. I also experience issues with headphone controls. I'm not impressed, if this is not rectified quick, I'm going back to my mp3s and saving me the premium subscription."
Bluetooth disonnect and playing needs work. When disconnected from the car or other devices music continues to play. The now playing half the time doesn't show in the app either this requires force kill to correct and even at that time doesn't always correct. Very irritating as I have a paid service!
I play a song and can't see the buttons for play/poss / next... Can't see what sing is playing. Fix please
My music on Spotify always keeps pausing randomly and sometimes when I press play button the music does not play. It's pretty annoying when I'm listening to music in the car and it randomly pauses
Currently having this bug of when i open a playlist and at the same time have it so that i can see my other playlist pr search for songs and leave the app while it's playing that the lowered bar of currently playing doesn't show... While i can hear the song... Clicking the play button on the same playlist doesn't work reopening does but it is a bit annoying when I'm having a song up while playing a game Also the whole premium thing but that is less annoying
"Algorithm is good, obviously music selection superb App is buggy as all hell - constantly something wrong with it Either the Playback buttons don't appear or the current song details don't appear or it refuses to stop. Sometimes refuses to play via Bluetooth or just cuts out at random intervals. Please sort this out Spotify it's absolutely absurd"
Tmobile and they forced updates ruined the app. Its not really Spotify its because your carrier made me upgrade when I never like to install. But yeah the mobile player in notifications window doesnt come up all the time. Itll stop in a second then resume in a sec or 2. The skips dont work if the mini player doesn't appear in SPOTIFY.
"Upd2 I'm a long paying customer, yet everything in the app is designed to prevent me from contacting support, but why?? You want a letter in post? // Do songs dissappear from Liked Songs?? and... Please ... add ""refresh"" function for Daily Mix playlist - when pull it to change your suggestions for another ones (e.g when you've already fed them to me yesterday ) - similar wishes in 2020, nothing changed since 2019."
"GREAT! Love it for downloading songs. Occasionally misses out on more rogue remixes. Why not 5 stars? Far too buggy. On my Google pixel and windows laptop it's buggy more often then not these days. Quite agrivating considering its my most used app. Scared now though... I feel once you've got Spotify you are stuck with it for life lol, so say goodbye to ¬£10 a month for the next decade aha"
I pay for premium as does my husband but over the last couple of weeks while playing music the app just shuts down. Restarts when we pick up the phone and push a button. We both have different phones and it does not matter if the phone is in use or idle. We have a playlist for our wedding in 2 weeks and am now worried it will just shut off in the middle! Not happy at all
"Spotify mobile is a good way to stream music, although it does get annoying to have advertisments every 2 songs, they aren't too long and usually aren't terrible. But for the love of all that is holy you gotta add the ability to stop certain ads from playing, ive been genuinely turned off from listening to Spotify because of that garbage Uber eats ad that plays every break, it doesn't make much sense to force tons of ads every 2 songs, and to give the user almost 0 control over what plays."
The recent update has caused my app to constantly lose track of where I am with my music and disconnect from my phone controls. I can't pause or unpause until I force quit the app and restart it.
"Hello! Something is going on with the play button of the Spotify. Recently it hasn't been appearing. What happens is that, yes I can choose a song but I no way have the buttons to stop, repeat, or go to the next song. I am able to listen to songs if manually go through my list but I can't stop the song or do other play options. I need to close the spotify app just to stop the song. Please fix this soon. Play button keeps disappearing. Thank you!"
"I like Spotify , but it has so many glitches , they seem to get fixed and then reappear and Spotify isn't quick to fix these glitches or inform you about any problems ."
"Recently my play and pause button has started regularly disappearing (basically the playing song never displays, the bottom part of the screen looks like I haven't selected a song). I checked if there's an app update to fix the bug, but no. Could you please check out if more users are experiencing this?"
This app rocks. But I've ran into a major problem in which my local files aren't showing up at all. It doesn't even show the number of songs anymore. My only source of adding my own songs to Spotify is ruined
"Unable to pause audio. In my notifications or on spotify, even when it's playing there is still a play button but not a pause button. Push play again and it just skips back a couple seconds"
"I love Spotify, and I've been using it for years, but this latest update has been terrible, it's got a LOT of bugs and errors compared to the updates that we've had before this one. The music stops itself all of a sudden, the music doesn't even play at all, you gotta restart the app for it to work properly again, the pause button doesn't work sometimes, and idk what else. I'd like it to get fixed though, I love Spotify but this type of things tend to get annoying on the daily."
"Started having problems today with the app not showing the built in player to pause rewind for fast forward through podcasts. Pixel 5a on OS12. After force close, it works, but didn't keep where I stopped."
"It does what it is designed to do. Except, user experience is subpar for all (un)paid accounts."
why the pop up play-next button often to dissapear? it is so disturbing bc i cant turn off or skip forward the music
"Recently started randomly stopping songs, also the play controls do not appear in app unless I force close it and open it again. I wish there was an option to hide podcasts, I'm not interested and it clutters the UI for nothing."
There's an issue where the songs that are playing disappears. I have to keep force stopping the app and opening it again for it to show up again. This is a huge nuisance. Please fix this. I've cleared the cache of the app (within the app and on my phone's system.) I'd install and reinstall however I have 20 gigs of downloads. This shouldn't be an issue if the first place.
I like the app but recently the 'playing now' button keeps disappearing in the app and on my lockscreen. The songs stop playing at random when this happens and I have to restart the app. Reinstalling didnt work.
"The app has been running quite smoothly, expect the last three months, I open the app and there's music ""playing"" meanwhile my player says it's paused (car player). Restarting Spotify seems like the only viable option, clearing my queue and starting from a random song or the last played one, seems random. If this still persists I would rather use YouTube music or other audio streaming platform."
For the past 6 years or so it's worked as intended...most annoying thing had been random songs constantly downloading and deleting themselves. This year a worse problem exists - songs or podcasts will freeze and the play bar doesn't show up so I can't scrub through the playtime to where I was. I have to quit Spotify then wait for it to open again ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è this happens frequently now. It's annoying to have to break focus on work or study to restart the app and find what you were listening to üö´
"Recently the music just stops playing all the time, and sometimes randomly starts again. Sometimes my controls (play/pause button) disappear now. So disappointed. I used to love Spotify."
"Spotify isn't statusing correctly anymore. Music will be playing, but the media control will show that it's paused. Pressing the start button won't do anything. Going into the app won't show any music playing or paused, but music will be playing. Happening consistently"
"Used to be amazing. A recent update has caused issues where it stutters and removes the player controls. This requires a restart for the app to fix. I loveSpotify, but I need this to be fixed."
"I would rate higher, but play back is awful. It's like playing a skipped CD and this is across many different devices. Compleatly ruining the listening experience."
It was the best music platform in my opinion but after all these updates and UI changes it has been a glitchy mess in the past year. Constantly having to close and reopen.
"The app is lagging continuously, which is quite annoying. Right now, every time I open the app, i can play music but don't see the bar at the bottom, same when I go to my home screen. I need to open it a few more times before it appears, and it's getting on my nerves."
"Buggy. Music randomly stops playing, even on strong WiFi. Now the play/pause button disappears and I have to hard reset the app to make it appear again."
"It's not awful, but there are many ways Spotify can improve to compete with rising competition. I've heard praise for the app but it's a laggy, unintuitive mess for me, especially compared to my new service TIDAL. In addition, the quality is worse and the recommendations I got on Spotify were worse for me. Another point is how little Spotify pays artists compared to other services, Spotify pays 0.003 per stream vs Quobuz's 0.04$ per stream. I hope competition improves Spotify a bit!"
"There seems to be an issue with the latest update. I can't see what song is playing nor the control functions, it keeps disconnecting and reconnecting to my Bluetooth, and the only way to stop the music playing is if I force quit the app on my phone."
"Range of music and podcasts is awesome, I love the ""song radio"" Playlists. The app is a pain sometimes. Songs/pods inexplicably stop mid track, the player just disappears so I can't pause or rwd ffwd and can only stop by closing app. Sometimes in library my new episodes of podcasts button is just gone. I've uninstalled/reinstalled numerous times due to these glitches."
"Spotify used to be great! Now the shuffle button has disappeared, and I can no longer change or pause the songs as the option is no longer there. Very frustrating"
"Very good choice of songs and podcasts, but crashing a lot, cutting , disconnecting from earbuds, disconnecting all the time from the car, the user experience is painful"
"Could be better via lyrics search. In the search box there could be a search lyrics. I spend my time going out of app and into google search and back into app. A pain especially at the start. Also when u listen to someones playlist be cool if there was a function to ""dislike/not like a song"" like there is in other sections, just so u dont have to go over the same song a few times. Otherwise very good. Since update on 5 April there is no pause or stop button so I can't stop the music playing!!"
"Since the last update, my music does play on my phone. But my phone and spotify does not give information which song is playing and or you don't have the next, previous or pause/play button. Please fix this."
"Ever since the new updat 4/5/22, spotify keeps crashing, pausing, my now playing button has disappeared and the feature for my to change the song without opening the app won't work and is always showing the wrong information"
"The UI glitches out heaps, I playing a song but it wont show where its playing."
"11.04.22- Currently the android App will not leave car mode, stops playing, and won't give access to standard pause/play menus. Requires manual restart, which is now illegal on UK roads so will have to uninstall until solved."
"Working best utiliza last update (on Samsung S10+ with OneUI 4.0) I start playing music and then it stops. Also playback notification (with music controls) won't work, and in-app music controls won't be shown."
Long load time if you have many downloaded songs (5k for me). Most recent update causes the music control bar to disappear until the app is relaunched. Android 12 OneUI 4 Galaxy S10
"My biggest complaint is the fact that there are many moments where you need internet just to access your downloaded podcast episodes. If I have no internet, the 'Your Episodes' page will just load and spin giving you a message telling you that there is no internet connection. Other than that, the app works perfectly and it's very intuitive."
Have had the app for years good app but seriously for the love of god stop trying to reinvent the wheel with the UI. Current one they just updated too doesnt show the song now playing half the time. Go back to the old UI without all these silly tiles ill never press on. Im not one to write reviews but for the good of the people it needed to be said
"4/10/2022 : The latest update has minorly affected the functionality of the app. My Now Playing (NP) sometimes disappears from the UI's bottom, simultaneously disappearing from persistent notifications. App must be restarted (force stop + reopen) to regain those elements. With a premium account it's otherwise fine, though I do frequently feel ashamed for supporting its executives. Despite their bosses, the devs continue to put out a quality app."
Whete is the song control at? It isnt appearing anymore and totslly ruining the experience on the app!
"The latest update on 4/8/22 ruined the app! This needs an update asap, a lot of people are having problems with Bluetooth devices,it's so annoying please spotify fix all this bugs!"
"Amazing app if you have premium, without it you're really limited on use though. Still with premium there are some anoying bugs like: the playing bar not showing or music cutting in and out. (Android 12, One UI 4.1)"
"I genuinely like Spotify however, I don't think you should have to pay for premium as you get money from the ads"
"Been having issues lately Wirth the player playing, but not haveing the player UI pop up and not being able to stop it playing. Started about a week 2 weeks ago, on and off, now it's every time I use spotify."
"I'm having issues after switching from ios to android. This apps got a lots of bugs and dark mode issues with MIUI, Xiaomi."
"I came for music and JRE. The interface on the app is ok and I get more commercials during JRE episodes some employees don't like. Tell everyone at Spotify who doesn't like JRE- they should just quit, we don't need their b.s. censorship."
It has many problems. Sometimes the song is on but the pause and resume button is not there . Sometimes even the song is changed but the poster of the song remains same.There are two 30 seconds ad after every 2 songs.It is very irritating . The only good thing is the sound quality.
"The bell button with notifications isn't opening, an error ""Something went wrong"" pops up every time - it's not been fixed for 2 updates straight Also please make an access to podcasts for Ukraine!! We are waiting for them too long"
This app is rlly great but it kept adding songs to my playlist like I went to YouTube to see if there's a way to stop it. There was a way but it still kept adding songs I don't even like them can u pls remove this It just ruins my mood
"I love spotify, but the android UI sucks compared to iPhone and pc, like most apps. I don't understand how an app removes useful feature to make it better. The shuffle and radio algorithms are awful, plays the same songs over and over. Finally got a ""swipe to add to queue"" option"
"I see Spotify is pushing updates for their mobile app... some are laggy and aren't as optimized. They make a few tweaks here and there, but I wish there was an option to play next ( next to the add to queue button) it'd be nice to have that, and also the app isn't as fluid as it used to be on my device (also takes longer to load), and I have having a song removed from my Playlist when I hit the unlike button by mistake (through the notification panel)."
"I get podcast recs constantly on my home page and a lot of them have gross cover art, and i want to know if theres a tleast a not interested button, or a way to just remove podcasts from suggestions"
"There's no way to share a song with another Spotify user, through Spotify. You can copy the link to your clipboard, email, text or post the song on social media, but you CANNOT send a song THROUGH Spotify to another another Spotify user. That's like the equivalent of Facebook not letting you share a post with your FB friend inside FB, but instead requiring you to send it to them through Gmail. Yea, I know, it sounds utterly ridiculous, but that's what Spotify does for some stupid reason!"
"This app is okay for the basics but it is missing some key features that the web download version has which makes it 10x better, being able to listen to songs without queuing etc, being fully able to edit your playlists and being able to see friends listening activity as well, these simple things would improve this app so much as right now it isnt the best and i've been a premium user for years :("
"UI is great, simple to use, the problem is with sound quality. Compare to other platforms the sound is not that great."
"Something happened that led to all of my downloaded songs being removed. But when I go online, it indicates the albums are fully downloaded even tho no song is downloaded. And when I try to save new tracks, it downloads forever.... Literally even on fast internet and plenty of storage space. I'm reinstalling the app but this is quite the inconvenience"
"Pros: Stable, fast, Spotify Connect is really quick. Cons: No multi-room streaming (like Amazon), worse selection than Apple Music, Shuffle doesn't work well, Radio still isnt as good as Pandora. Also: Megadeth only has the remasters."
"3 stars. Shuffle has strange behavior that it does not actually shuffle well. This seems to be a bug (or strange design decision) since ages. All in all it's pretty ok. Ps: I left Spotify for podcasts, because podcast management is quite horrible. Podcast Addict app is 10x better."
The app is amazing but the amount of ads are really annoying. The ads are too frequent that it totally ruins the mood of the song...
"It's an okay app, however, I find it very frustrating that Spotify keeps playing the same 10 songs even if you're on shuffle mode. I use Spotify to listen to my liked songs while I work and it really sucks to be in the middle of work and have to skip multiple songs in order to get a new one because you've been listening to the same songs over and over, it's ridiculous, specially if you have thousands of songs downloaded. The only ""solution"" is to hit the shuffle button again, really inconvenient"
"Love this app for listening, but it will just automatically start playing in places. The app has a few quirks"
Spotify has significantly lowered user experience lately. You are unable to listen to a song you want without shuffling through an entire album just to reach the song you want. Ads almost every other song doesn't help either. Is there even a music company not money-hungry?
"I am on the paid version. It's awesome. But I am a heavy listener of podcasts and I dislike the shuffling of episodes - please put those buttons on the ""now playing"" page so I don't need to keep going to a music playlist to turn it off/on. 5 stars when fixed."
"3 stars, at first it was a 5 star rating. Very good at the start, excellent app indeed, but not too long it started glitching, i uninstalled and installed again, it worked fine. But now, only 3 stars, there's no repeat button on mobile, and no shuffle remover button at the bottom, I can't listen to the music i like. Please fix it."
"The spp is great, though some albums are missing and you struggle to find the song youre looking for occasionally, overall id say its still a pleasant experience and most artists can be found easily, also id say its a great way to find new ones. Now a problem with UI pops up every few updates, i had it crash a bunch before, now the playbar isnt working properly, but its still mostly usable and a nice experience if you have premium."
"Just wanted to give you attention and pls listen... Whenever I clicked the ""Gear"" button aka the ""Setting"" it crashed immediately. I tried to restart my phone, clear the app data. Re log in. Still crashed whenever I clicked setting. Fixed this quick"
It's okay. It does the job and without paying a hefty sum of money you can get the music you want. One issue I've found though: would it kill you to make the ads a lower volume? I'm trying to study and getting an ad every 10 minutes which is double the volume of my music really ruins the vibe and kills my concentration.
"A bit better with the latest updates. Can find anything quite easily and it starts playing downloaded songs without internet now. Still stops playing when screen locks, but less frequently than a few updates ago."
Downloaded podcasts goes away after a few days even on premium. Songs not affected. I am always travelling and downloading them is quite expensive. Please fix this issue with podcasts. Been having this issue since February.
Awful UI. How is it that when I view an album it's impossible to view the entire tracklist? Whose idea was this??
"hi spotify, just wondering why is it the widget not changing color anymore following the album color? im on samsung a72 running oneui 4.0 android 12, thanks"
"Ehh, ever since I got the galaxy s22, nothing but bugs. Volume lowers all the way down after one song plays when playing through aux, part of the issue if probably galaxy software as im also unable to record media if my aux cord is plugged in. But please attempt to fix if possible"
"Overall in one word Spotify is great, the UI is the easiest and most efficient compared to those from the competitors, I'm really glad that lyrics are back but what I'd love to see is Spotify changing how the library looks, whether changing it back to the way it was or coming up with something different because this filter based system doesn't really work for me, I feel like it's much more cluttered and less efficient, right now I have to put more effort in finding what I need."
"Very well polished app, if you pay for premium. If not, the experience is horrible. Love the ability to download any song I want at the touch of a like button. Lost another star because they removed support for my brand new radio that I installed in my truck."
"no loop button, only 6 skips per hour, plays recommebded songs that i dont want to hear i just want to hear the song i chose, has lots of music options tho. On laptop i get unlimited skips, i can loop for free and no recommebded songs ^_^ plus the ads suck on mobile. sry for harsh review but I'm really pissed with how bad spotify on android is."
"It is a great app for songs, my criticism comes with the shuffle button. It literally plays the same few songs over and over again."
I've been using since 5 years ago everyting was okey but for now its not showing any play button. Few more things i couldn't see a control bar on notification menu. My device is Note20 ultra after when i download latest upgrade issues started
"The app is not intuitive or easy to use. Once I learned how to make it work somewhat for me I changed from a 1 to a 3. It is average, but youtube music is more user friendly. I still don't like the hearts on download. I download to listen offline, not because I like or love it. After I listen I will decide."
"For such a big company, the app is still woefully buggy. I'd say 80% of the time it works OK, but there are several annoying bugs such as: - after podcasts for offline listening, you can't actually access them because clicking on the podcast requires Internet to load the descriptions etc so you get stuck with the green circle - sometimes the playback section fails to appear even after opening and closing the app, needing a reinstall... - the playback time gets stuck regularly"
Getting better but still have to force close the app on Android when the control panel (play buttons) disappear every few days.
Bthe ads just ruin my whole day I'm just trying to listen to music
The adds are quite annoying but other then that it's a good streaming platform!
"The fact that their shuffle algorithm is clearly designed to pump numbers into more popular songs while leaving more obscure songs in the dust is terrible. I have been hearing the same 40 songs or so out of 600 songs for months and months. At least half of the songs have NEVER been played. I forgot I even had them until I looked through the list. While other songs have had dozens of plays. That is not random, and is really taking a dump on the consumer who pays for this product (me)."
"I have been using Apple Music and Spotify side by side for 2 years now. I realised that I liked Spotify more because it's more intuitive. However, Spotify has very limited music controls if compared to Apple music. It would be great if the developers can add options like ""Play Next"", ""Play Later"", ""Shuffle Play"" and the option to choose whether to download a liked song or not and not automatically download on Spotify for PC or Mobile."
The recently played and new release buttons often cause the app to freeze when I try to click them
Queue is not accessible any more in the Android App. There's not even pause/play button. It's so sad paying premium for the app breaking it's own UX with new error every month!
"Intrusive ads, but good music, not quite SiriusXM quality, but great for free."
"It's pretty good user experience. They still have a lot of work to do, but they are at least working out the kinks, and actually listen to their customers."
"Swipe left for previous, right for next is bad UI. I keep doing it by accident while trying to pull my notification panel down. There should also be a way to close a podcast, or at least put the small window that shows what's currently playing/paused in the Android notification panel."
"If you want free music, go to You Tube. Even the annoyance of not being able to play music in background is better than searching a song and then getting a random pick by the artist. End up switching on radio. All designed to get premium. Kids might fall for this"
"Draws to much battery and the interface is all over the place! I thought you where Swedes? Energy efficient, clean and intuitive design should be the priority! And this ain't it!"
Best app ever... would give it a 5 star rating. I've been using it since 2021 almost everyday but for some reason aonly today it started only playing pieces of the songs. And a circle going around the play button. Ounce the circle has gone all the way around the song immediately stops. Spotify... this is the best app on earth because for someone like me(who loves music to death). I need to listen to the music that I love. But I can't because there is this ANNOYING problem. PLEASE TRY TO FIXü•∫
Super good app but please add the loop button for free users also please
"Just been logged out and nothing is working currently Ive gone to my saved passwords and it only pops with my old acc which I saved both new + Old, so it looks like my account has been deleted for some reason?? I genuinely can't get anything and I had premium, it's genuinely rlly frustrating atm as I have been spending quite alot of money on it, as I do love my music üíÄüíÄ"
"The issue was fixed, I just have to download my music again, thanks for getting it fixed quickly"
"I cannot log in for some reason, it kicked me out in the middle of the song and now I cannot log back in and it's kinda frustrating. Hopefully it's only some sort of update or the servers are down. Otherwise everything's okay, missing quite a few songs/albums from some artists, maybe someday they will be added because I hate going on youtube to listen 10000 ads in between songs."
"Frequently pauses, often the pause button disappears and occasionally crashes."
"UI is confusing. Always plays the songs in random order, even when I want to listen to an album start to finish."
"I enjoy using Spotify, as it has nice colour scheme, a great variety of artists and genres and its design used to be really pleasing to the eye. As a premium user, I can say that my experience with the app is quite nice. But there are some things that are a bit tiring. #1: Why do the ¬´Trending¬ª and ¬´Top¬ª playlists or things this kind keep on showing on my home page? There are users not interested in what is trendy at all... #2: Why have the icons changed to be so rough-hewn and ugly?"
It has a lot of songs I like that is on Spotify but not SoundCloud (and one not on YouTube for some reasons). But I use Android and there's no loop button for Android on mobile.
"The accessibility is quite easy, but ads are annoying for free users. Album can be created by the users, which helps me to listen my favourite track list."
"Not a fan of the new update. I prefer the shuffle play button being an option for the playlists, them being separate now is just irritating and inconvenient."
"For the most part I enjoy Spotify. Don't appreciate the adds they drop in the middle of podcasts. If the add is a sponsor of the podcast it's self and read by the podcaster, that's fine. But I boycott any adds I'm force fed by spotify. Won't ever find me buying a Mazda now. Oh and the offline mode is a bit squirrelly, doesn't always work."
The progress bar not viewable in dark mode. Would like button to remove a song quickly from a playlist if not liked. Also would be great to specify artists or genres Im not interested in.
"It works great on my phone but why the hell can't I watch video on my tv. I only hear the audio and no video. Specially the Joe Rogan Podcast. I have a Phillips 4k Tv. Spotify needs to fix this quick, why not have the option to watch on my tv instead of my phone. Fix this Spotify."
"i like the app alot, but it does not deserve this high of a rating. there are numerous glitches, including randomly pausing my music, infinite skips without premium, and glitchy buttons. ive finally had enough and am getting apple music."
"Sometimes some of my downloaded songs get randomly deleted, and I constantly have to redowload them. There were whole albums as well that just suddenly dissapeared. Also the app closes down despite me not even closing it. These almost happen on an everyday basis. Can you please fix these glitches, because it makes the experience quite bad."
The app is awesome bt after my last update yesterday it keeps pausing itself and I manually have to resume play it's not a network connection issue because everyother thing seems to be working perfectly. It's just annoying to have to leave what you're doing to come press the play button anytime it pauses. Please fix it.
"I want this to be better, but it intermittently cuts out in the middle of a song/podcast, and the UI occasionally disappears. I see I'm not the only reviewer experiencing this either."
Update fix the clear cache and download button too close together !
Include an edit button on the Your Episodes podcast playlist. This is a much needed feature!
"Spotify keeps deleting my downloaded songs on my SD Card after a simple phone restart and I had to download it all again for which I don't have enough time.... Plus the annoying Pause/Play problems plaguing spotify, I really don't see why I should continue paying the premium subscription... A few songs are unplayable because the music player glitches and the following song only plays fir 3 seconds before pausing and becoming unresponsive. Please fix this, if you want people to contiue paying."
"I have an issuse from footer side Didn't display next button,pause button and drag the song segment issuse from spotify -poco m2 series"
Was working great for a while and now my shuffle button is gone on all artists and everything is listed twice under the artist. Not happy. I have premium and this is not what we are paying for at all. Not listening until this problem is fixed.
"Since the update at the start of February it has made my in car experience absolutely dismal. My Kenwood head unit DDX4017BT with built in Spotify feature now only displays connecting, and I have to use the Bluetooth settings, which has poor app control, also the auto connect feature no longer works. I've attempted all options to rectify this problem, and when you travel over 1000kms a week or gets very frustrating. I'm happy to pay my premium account but sort out this issue many people have."
Decided to leave because it can't stream music quite some time although phone is connected to Data/WiFi. And the song options are quite few and it's algorithm of playing songs is weird(keep streaming same songs).
"This app got rid of some very handy things like proper playlist scrolling when you could quickly scroll through your playlist easily and it would show where you were in the playlist alphabetically. Now everyone has to scroll down to bottom while constantly swiping their thumb across the screen like a maniac. Also playlist search could be greatly improved if you searched for one track and you still got your playlist in queue, not just the track I was looking for."
"So I've started uploading my own music onto Spotify. I was able to listen to my first song just fine but now I can't listen to any of my songs. It's not that it won't play, when I press the play button it just straight up plays a completely different song. Is there a reason I can't listen to my own music?"
"I used to be able to quickly filter through my liked songs by scrolling through the alphabet on the right hand side of the screen. It seems with recent updates that this feature has been removed for some reason. As I have over 1000 liked songs, this leads to endless scrolling until I get to the song that I want. Please reprogram this filtering option."
"Honestly love the app, does everything you'd want it to do in order to listen to your favorite songs and/or podcasts. Just wish these low life companies would leave you alone with all of these advertisements like honestly dude get a life and stop ruining mine. Next time you interrupt Limp Bizkit, im committing arson to your headquarters and that's a promise losers."
"This app could just be so much better. If Spotify ever wants me to use their platform to listen to Podcasts they need to incorporate features other podcast apps have had for years. On the music side, everything just feels a bit clunky and never quite right. Also, my Good Morning/Evening section hasn't updated in months (across all platforms), so I'm still being recommended Christmas music."
Doesn't delete the search result quickly upon pressing X after the new update.
"Yes, like all, it's those constant ads. Initially it was 2 ads per 4 or 5 songs, then it was 2 ads per 2 or 3 songs. It was still fine. But now, its 3 ads per 2 or 3 songs and it's frustrating. Not all can afford or would like to take a premium. So kindly look after the ads. Apart from that I'd prefer spotify because it introduced me to different artist with the kind of music I listen to. Also, spotify streams means a lot to an artist's career as well. PS, stream Walls by Louis Tomlinson."
I payed to have prime and I still get dum pop ups The software is maga buggy UI looks like I started to put over the fire and is melting The app doesn't respond The app doesn't uppdate when needing to and the only way to fix it is sigout But hay bunch of music in one place and for a good price I use the app around 7h a day
"Widget shouldn't change colors with every new song, it ruins whatever theme you may have set for your phone, also an expandable one with full screen, art and controls would be awesome, your widget is the only reason I won't subscribe to Spotify"
"Well, they've finally done it, kids! For some reason, it took Spotify's engineers & designers 2 whole years to bring all of the iOS redesign features to Android, but, they've finally done so and for that, I'm thankful. We pay the same amount as iOS users do, and we deserve the same care and attention in our updates. Hopefully, they'll keep pace (and feature parity) going forward, now that both platforms are on a somewhat level playing field!"
"Love the app, but please for the love of all that is good, remove the unnecessary delay before the menu opens, when I long press a song! I usually queue songs I want to listen to, and having to wait up to half a second before the menu appears on every... single.... song... makes it so tedious! It's not there on desktop - so please just remove it on phone as well! It's such a bad user experience"
"Was a good app. Decent quality, decent interface. Definitely trying to get your money though with annoying ads, limited skips, and no on-demand play. Now it's not even letting me see what's on my playlists. Quite glitchy and needs major improvement."
Music stops randomly when i press the volume buttons. (OnePlus 7 Pro)
"Good selection of music and podcasts, but it is not very intuitive to use. And why is the maximum time for the sleep timer 1hr?"
I don't think I really enjoy how the new buttons look. They're too bold and too cartoonish. Can we reverse them to the previous thin ones please?
Shuffle is not really good. Out if for example 500 songs it keeps repeating the same 30 songs over and over. Quit annoying honestly. I don't know if I did something in my setting. Another example If you search and play a new song the following once will always be something that's been played a 1000 times. Very annoying
"Music catalogue is 5-star. App has got less slow but could be much better. It now hangs when history icon tapped. Don't like that Shuffle is now turned on when trying to play Release Radar etc in order. Sorting a playlist (hidden by an unituitive down-drag not in the menu as it used to be) by 'recently added' sorts the wrong way unless you tap it twice. Been like that for ages. Poor design and testing. Could be improved with freq. used buttons, eg 'Add To Queue', 'Add To Playlist'"
"I legit just closed the app because I couldn't switch playlists, went on to a 7th or 8th ad just now.. This app is Full of Repetitive ads ruining the whole experience."
"Great great service but should have better UX, I need many clicks to star listening what I want. I need my personalized home screen."
"When it works it's great. Cold starting the app can take multiple minutes to stream the first song (just gets stuck on the timecode I give it), even on a fast connection. The vertical meatball button isn't very responsive and takes a few seconds to open, really annoying if you want to add/remove songs from a playlist."
No scroll bar in liked list when it had one up until the most recent update is annoying. Makes it hard to quickly get to a certain section of a long list.
Keeps shutting off in the middle of listening. Sometimes can't shut it off when I press the pause button. No way to turn off the app/ exit listening button.
Since the last update it won't show what I'm listening to or what's playing. It's basically like the app isn't open. Been a fan and apart of Spotify for 4 years now. A quick fix I hope.
"Please add a search button when you open a podcast's page. I have to scroll down to check if a podcast on a specific topic has been uploaded or not. Whenever I open an artist/band's page, their general information should be displayed on the top. Also there's too many ads in the free version"
This aap is quiet cool for music lovers (with adds) but has some gilches as there were over 100 songs in liked ones but now it shows only 3 of em
Can you please bring back the slider/scroller bar so that we can quickly scrub through our playlists? It comes and goes with every update and I wish it would just stay.
This a really good music app but really no play button for songs and no repeat like???are you kidding me how am I suppose to play and stop music which is the the point?!!üôÑüò§üò§üò§üò†üò†üò°
"I have enjoyed Spotify thus far. However, if Spotify continues to sensor free speech I will gladly delete the app and never return. And I'm sure I'm not alone. Bowing to leftist extremism is quickly becoming a death sentence for businesses. The world is sick of it."
"I like the mixes, Spotify predicts the music pretty well. Also the music selection is pretty good, the design and interface is okay. However there is a fine line and it goes wrong sometimes especially when suggesting artists. It's cool!"
"I m a person who believes in music to be in cruise control and that is what I came to expect using Amazon Music. Don't like to skip, search songs as it gives a frictional experience. Unfortunately Spotify playlists leave a lot to be desired in this regard. You can tolerate ads, but not poor song selection."
"Been okay so far nothing to rav about just the UI needs a update it's clunky and sluggish, lack of long press for options is soo 2012 UI/UX designs I'm not even going to go into the home page it's just a mess please clean that up somehow How does a music player not have a play next button?? ü§î Or Custom playlist cover if the app is set up to use playlists as the main method"
"Generally good algorithm-generated playlists, but can be too repetitive across multiple mixes at times. Podcast UX is terrible. Not being able to sort downloaded podcasts by date published is infuriating, and having old episodes randomly show up in the queue is incredibly annoying. Having to delete downloaded episodes and remove them individually from the 'my episodes' list is the definition of tedium. I've stopped listening to Spotify exclusives because it's just not worth the pain."
Quite a good app also I'm not bothered by ads but when it gives two ad atta time it triggers me also the new option for sharing the lyrics isn't available on my device yet I've reinstalled and also updated it several times but that doesn't seems to do anything so I'd like y'all to take action on these things and overall I recommend it
"Still great for playing mysic, but the creeping advertisements and recommendations for podcasts I don't care about is making me consider switching to something else. UX is starting to exploit me, rather than work for me."
I keep having trouble with the app the last couple of months. The controls quit working and I have to keep reinstalling to get it to work right.
"One of my favorite apps for all thibgs podcast and music, but latley so many hickups and changes with no reason or rhym, is becoming quite annoying."
"Hey, Spotify team! What's going on with the app lately? For the past couple of months I've been experiencing frequent and random disconnects. It's annoying & frustrating...it ruins the whole experience. I am a premium plan subscriber and a huge fan. Please fix this! P.S. It's not the internet connection ( I have 500 Mbps downloading speed). Thanks!"
I'm cutting two stars from it because there's constantly ads in my playlist. Before it was quite good like I got uninterrupted listening without ads but now it's very annoying that after every song there is an ad. if the user does not want to buy the premium subscription then how can you force a user!! it's your loss only bcz after one point the user will get irritated and then download some other apps of music like I did. so better concentrate on this issue.
"I have paid version and app still takes forever to load. Don't have the greatest phone either so that could be a factor. The update previous to February 2022 erased all my downloads. I also dislike that erase cache and erase all downloads buttons are next to each other, accidentally erased all my downloads."
"The Spotify algorithms work well, but the app has broken UI in dark mode on MIUI Global 12.5.6 (Android 11). The play/pause button has incorrectly set colors, as well as some other elements on the play screen."
"Well, the reason I gave it 3 stars is this, Number 1 problem, ads disturb my music and sometimes ruins the mood. Number 2, they put music in few of the Playlists(Daily mixes) some other songs which I do not like. Number 3, in playlists they play the song in shuffle. I nean, what's the point of mobile if laptop is better. I'd rather use Spotify Web player on computer cuz I can actually choose from playlist which song I wanna hear."
"It's literally a good app. But sometimes it ruins my cellphones technical support! And sometimes it shows ""Unfortunately Spotify has been stopped"" It's so hilarious! üòë"
Good App UI. Excellent music collection. I mainly use it via chromecast and in that aspect it is quite terrible. Loses connection all the time. Keeps on connecting and disconnecting from my chromecast.
"****ckin ADs every time, the idiotic thing is that they play spotify premium ads every time. 2 ads for between every song, pls dont ruin the music feel."
"App is missing a lot of very obvious features. Needs a ""shuffle album"" and ""shuffle artist"" button like every other media player since time began. Needs to be able to scroll back in the Queue to see what's already played."
"Theme and browse features arent exactly tuned for my taste while AI selection is way better than competition. The selection though has either went way downhill or the AI here is starting to slip some. The freemium vs paid i feel needs better tuning. I did eventually subscribe, but hate the family plans. I also used my PS4 initially to start spotify. Meaning my entire built list was news to me on other platforms that i needed a paid account to use the any song feature. That isnt happy experiences"
There are just too many ads. its more like listening to ads than songs. we cant even listen to 2 songs continuously because of the ads. and i'm from north india giving me tamil ads makes no sense. there are other music apps too which we can switch to and are ad free and that'll make spotify users lesser. frequency and amount of ads should be reduced. overall the songs and quality is nice but ads ruin the experience.
I don't know why but the search button isn't working. When i click on the search button the app shuts down automatically and if any song is playing that also stops. If possible i request to fix this problem.
"Have been using spotify for a long time. However, comparing to IOS version, the Android version is worse. Main thing being that I can't add song to the queue by swiping to the right like I could on the IOS, I have to press 3 dots and press a button, or hold a song and then still press a button. And cannot play daily mixes straight away in shuffle as well when adding to mix to the queue"
"Good overall, but the block artist option doesn't seem to always work (new releases and collaborations) and doesn't seem available for podcasts. The option to remove undesirable content would obviously improve the user experience. I've been finding myself switching to other platforms to avoid getting annoyed."
The app is great but one major issue I haven't been able to like any songs for the last few days or remove any liked songs it was working days before but then the like button stopped working and it hasn't been responsive since
Great app but ruined by too many ads particularly if an ad for 30 mins is displayed...within 15 mins another ad is displayed...Ads are running for free service but try to understand that too much of anything is good for nothing... People listen to music in various mindset but continuous ads keep on disrupting the listener... I finally uninstalled this app.
"1 ad, i could deal with, 2 ads ok whatever, BUT 3 ADS??? IN A ROW TOO???? that is so dumb, and idk why but whenever i want to look at what else is the there in an album or playlist, the ""more"" button doesnt work anymore, so i have to go through THE WHOLE PLAYLIST with only 6 skips and ADS!!! A MILLION OF ADS!! That is so stupid, if i could download anything else i would, but unfortunately this is the only app thats decent enough. Spotify please get rid of the million of ads and go back to 1"
"Please combine Stations and Spotify (matter of fact combine all the individual Spotify apps into one). This is one of the main reasons why I haven't switched from Amazon music. Switching between two apps just to hear a STATION is NOT intuitive. Also, it's a fairly interruptive experience."
I can't pause or play with my phone locked anymore. The buttons are showing that they're being pressed but still nothing. Normally wouldn't be a huge deal but since i listen at work it can be a big inconvenience. Otherwise the rating would be much better.
The app is great except the fact that if you don't pay for premium they ruin your listening experience. They play the same songs over and over and over again and they interup you with adds every 5 seconds. I like it but I don't have the money for premium and it really makes me mad to have this happen when all I wanna do is listen to music.
Tried the app again after a long time off it and what a change. The lyrics functionality is now present and the app is no longer buggy and slow. I still don't understand why we have to deal with podcasts though. New artist recommendation deserves a bigger spotlight (front and centre). Tour dates and merch is harder to find now. How about artist interviews and SM built in. Listening parties is still a mission. At this point it's just okay and barely competes with the other services. Music first.
Doesn't have some songs at all. Should have a tab that lists every song by an artist rather than greatest hits and then discography. Also app just quits casting randomly despite strong connection. The feedback below has helped me make a decision on if I want to continue to PAY for thsi service next month when the free sub runs out. Ummm NO.
"After the new update spotify has stopped auto playing with my Ford Focus 2014 SYNC! Before it used to start playing my music automatically from where I left off as soon as I turned the car key. But now I have to manually open spotify & start my playist & also keep spotify app open. If I close the app it stops automatically playing & my widget also goes blank & unresponsive when pressing the play button! Please sort this if possible. Using a Samsung S10 Lite, worked perfectly before update."
"The algorithm is just dumb. Pay the artist! Instead of songs going to a cache, maybe let access them as downloaded tracks? Its just dumb having 5gb of cache and 5gb of downloaded songs when the cache is nothing more then what played after my downloaded artists. The algorithm is also JOKE! For example it will cycle through 2 Ramones songs even though it could pick any of their songs to the same user experience. It is no wonder every artist has two song that are played disproportionately more."
"Decent interface for normal music playback on mobile. However, the removal car mode was a step in the wrong direction. Removing the big-buttoned, simple, driving interface that reduces driver distraction was great, and voice controls are not an adequate substitute."
"Best music app at the moment. ads won't bother you during one or thrice song. the ads are balanced on playlist. but theres one more thing that is not available to the users, is that hiding unwanted podcasts. theres this one podcast about sex and i'm not really interested in that. (that podcast is in my recommendations) its really annoying, it makes me lose interest in listening to my own playlist, it just ruins my day. therefor, this apps good. this app is like my casette tapes back in the day."
"UPDATE: It's getting better. Keeps going back to start after ads... They interrupt podcasts with ads that used to only have ads at the beginning & end. In the middle of a very deep & sad story, Spotify will interrupt with a lame ad that totally ruins the mood of the story. Finally, getting Spotify's web player to work with Edge is a nightmare and it's the ONLY player with that issue."
"I have YouTube music for now. Thinking about switching but I don't think Spotify has a ""play next"" button or ""Starr radio button"".....these things a kind of a big deal to me..."
"The current UI needs work. There's certain elements that work better even in the Lite version, such as album sorting. Create an option to stop being forced upon random podcasts - maybe a seperate tab. Thanks for adding lyrics +1*. Downloaded playlists and albums get deleted often. Maybe add some optional listening stats. It's a good app, there has been some improvements over the past few months but these frustrations are off-putting."
So I used to be able to tap my Playlist and then pick a song or just pick the first song on the top of my Playlist to restart it now I have to press the shuffle button and it annoying and you can only skip 6 time per hour. Spotify please fix this it used to a 5 star but with this new thing it's a 3. Now I have to listen to pandora.
"It's good, but could be better, I'm talking about the layout, how easy it is to move your finger to the buttons you always use, I don't understand why they always want all option buttons to be up high on a phone when 90% of us have smartphones and have to move our finger all the way to the top of the screen just to add the song to our playlists. Like especially when you listen to so much music and AHH so annoying. Stupid Devs and their stupid designs. Also have more to add but there's no space."
I use this every day- but the UI is bad. It has been updated but I prefer the old UI circa 2017. I wish HiFi would drop soon.
"Alright, good work Spotify the latest update that came brought some new aesthetical looks, the whole player bar got reworked, it looks better. Love the design. Also Spotify feels smoother but they still haven't made it so that Android users have the swipe, drag features that iPhones do to queue songs. Would be quicker and easier overall usage. A huge tip for the next Wrapped is to make it actually funtional for Android users. Should be obvious. With users and android users increasing each day."
"There is just too many ads, there shouldn't be that much ads, it's not normal, sometimes. Somestimes you're feeling the song and you're in the mood then suddenly all the ads crash in and ruined the whole vibe."
"I love spotify, what I don't love is trying to get something to play. Podcasts or liked songs on shuffle have a delayed play back time. I'll press the play button and won't hear anything until three, four, five mins later. This has been going on for awhile, the same thing happened to me about a year ago. It takes forever to get a song or podcast to play. Please help."
Occasionally the app will completely shut down and music will stop playing. Ads also require me to turn on my phone before they are able to play.
"Lots of music, plenty mini app flaws. Shuffle button is impossible to deactivate on playlist. Not on a mobile nor on tablet. While listening to the music you have tap like seven buttons to review the list. I'm on a 3 month free account right now and i doubt if this app will last that long on my phone. Due to app flaws, after initial excitment (for about 3 weeks) today was my first use in two weeks meaning that i don't really need it."
"I love the app and always listen to songs through spotify, but I am going to my grandparents tomorrow, and there is no wifi there, so I used premium. i only needed a week, and premium mini only allowed me 30 songs to download. Thanks for ruining my week. Idk if there are other options for only a week, but i checked and only premium mini was there. iadk if it's still there but if not, bring back the old premium before i start 2022 in a bad mood."
"I like this app bcoz I could listen to music while I watched some videos on yt or any other platform. That's impressive for meü§£üëè. But after the newest update which is today, I can't choose the music that I want. Only can press ""shuffle play button"". Seriously!! That's what makes this apps became terrible for meüò≠ plz make this apps just like beforeüôèü•∫"
Love it!! Been using it for quite a while and it's been great! Integration with the desktop app makes it so useful for uninterrupted listening. My go-to app for online music streaming. *Edit- Minus 2 stars due to a glitch that shows I am offline even though I am connected.
"If you have Premium then Spotify is quite good, you can listen to songs repeatedly. Annoyingly it says you can listen to music without WIFI but I can only listen to about 4-5 songs before it kinda crashes and won't change songs. NOW, if you don't have premium then the app is terrible, there are way to many ads. There are about 5 ads between 3 songs. Also when you search up a song it will go into a playlist with that that song but not play it. Best way to enjoy this app is to spend ¬£10 minimum"
Hey there hello...Your app is quite good in terms of song quality but there are some problems also like may songs and albums are not available on the app. In case of lyrics different language for every song. Please sort out Bug ASAP. So that I can enjoy Music
"The recent updates have ruined this app and how it works. It used to be amazing. I wish I could have the old Spotify back. It feels like it's time to stop paying the subscription fee and look for another music option. Sadly I can no longer recommend it. To any that have it, DON'T UPDATE IT or you will be pissed!"
"The problem with metadata over bluetooth is still not solved. Song info is rarely correct when connected to my car and it's ruining the otherwise good experience - this is an ongoing issue, and other players(foobar, deezer) do not have this problem. Have tried jumping through hoops with different bt protocols on my android phone, battery setting etc., but it's not working. Just fix it already, I bet your devs know exactly what the problem is."
"To spotify Thx to u guys, I can listen to music without keep letting my phone on, but there are a tons of problems First, when I want to listen to a music repeatedly, I can't cuz there is no buttons for that, I checked settings and still no Second, I want to restart the order, but still it give me the same order, check the settings already, still no. Third, when I want to listen a specific song, I must go shuffle. Hope u can fix that"
"I'm so annoyed by the fact that some of my friends aren't showing up on my friends activity list.Ik they're active few days ago but still,their names don't show up.Only half of the accs I follow actually show up.It happens when I moved to another device to listen to music.After that,their names are gone,forever. Secondly,sometimes I use my phone as a remote control.But after leaving the app for awhile,it freezes and I have to restart my phone and it really takes quite some time."
"This is a really good app, I have been using it for quite a time now but it doesn't show the lyrics of any song in my phone. I tried to reinstall and try but it still doesn't show any. Please fix this glitch as soon as possible."
"this was a great app tbh but why has spotify now have this ""we added""? because now it completely ruined spotify. I cant find a way to get rid of the songs you added into my playlist like- its there for a reason. I don't want other songs in my playlist, can you fix this? I"
"The 'skip back/previous track' button should ALWAYS skip back to whatever was playing previously. Too many times I've been scrolling a playlist to accidentally tap a song, then I've feverishly tapped the back button (to the left of pause button) to go back to what I wanted to listen to, only to find the button just restarts the current song."
"So Spotify decided to quit the widget just because, the icon to put the offline in the quick settings also disappeared before, I used it always. If I knew this was going to happen I wouldn't have paid the premium and just used other service"
"It's all so tiresome...Update Dec 6th 2021, even more loading lags, of course the extra ads load. Also now crashes when tried on xbox one. Album artwork not matching song being played. App needs a refresh button badly."
"It's a good app but I do have a problem with it,Every time i tap the my library and premium buttons or any other buttons it brings up that black rectangle that states ""spotify has stopped"" or ""is not responding"",i ask that you fix this issue immediately so I could go back to peacefully listening to my music THANK YOU"
"Okay, so the music quality is good, it has basically any song you can think of, from the latest hits to things from the 50's, however I think that 2 ads per 3 songs is quite annoying you barely get any choice of what you listen to on phone and premium is too expensive on computer it's alot better but still not good also wrapped doesn't work, the app just crashes every time"
Cannot see lyrics for some reason. Sometimes my playlist/queue button is disabled. Fix these stuff ppl. Other than that...its an amazing app with superb collection of songs
"Spotify is a great service and I really like it but this app has so many problems, bugs and bad designs. This field has a limit of 500 chars and I definitely could list more flaws than that. For example: who invented that scrollbar on lockscreen? I misclicked on it while listening to the podcast so many times and it is so frustrating to go through >1h podcast and seek where it was interrupted. Why Spotify needs internet connection to play downloaded things?"
For a paid app with downloads I don't understand why my downloaded playlists load so much more quickly than my downloaded podcasts when I have no signal. I'm constantly in doors for work where I have no signal so when I don't have signal initially I can't load up my downloaded podcasts. However my song playlists do not have this problem. Very irritating and time wasting hopefully this can be fixed.
"Awesome music displayed ,easy navigation of music and various artist .An offline experience would also be a good alternative where one accesses any playlist anytime without network requirements"
"I am disappointed in your ""shuffle"" even though I have built extensive playlists, I always seem to hear the same songs over and over. Please work on improving this."
"I really like the app and it's quite easy to use. However it feels like there are more ads then songs and it's quite annoying. Also I can't seem to view my wrapped 2021 because whenever I try to view it, the app just crahses."
It's a great app for listening to music but I won't let me see my 2021 wrapped as it has the refresh button in the screen but just flashed through the 2021 wrapped then kicks me off the app.
"Drive mode was a great safety feature, cause i cant skip songs through my cars controls. Now car mode was taken off the app....but im still going to listen to music while driving....so instead of making it safer....you did the opposite. Cause now i need to unlock, look where to press the next button....miss it and try again and again and again, all while driving. Stupid."
"Spotify Wrapped opens for a moment, and then the app crashes. Can't even view mine. Update: Apparently, you need at least Android version 8.6.80 for Wrapped. Why this has suddenly changed when it seems virtually the same save for the actual graphics than from the previous years is beyond me."
"The app is good with good quality music and ive bern using it for quite a while. I uninstalled and recently installed it again, i wanted to check my spotify wraps 2021 but whenever i want to it constantly crashes and kicking me out. Ive cleared cache, forced to stop but still no improvement."
"What's happened to my widget? Disappeared after updating, now the only available widget is less functional and quite unattractive. You must know this; it was undoubtedly a deliberate strategy. I'd like to know your reasoning.."
"Absolutely love this app. Daily playlists, people also like, recommended for you etc are all brilliant. Love how easy it is to update playlists. BUT.. not being able to switch users on the family plan without logging out and logging back in is completely ruining the experience. I use lullabies for my daughter and they are now clogging up my daily playlists. PLEASE add a Netflix-type switch account option on the family plan."
Update Nov 21: The App is getting bulky and sluggish now. It used to be the best UI/UX Music App out there but unfortunately it is going down. The UI is still better than others but it's moving to the bad side. Keep it simple guys. The music stucks and app crashes since last few months.
"Used for years now - good options for saving to library, downloading etc. Similar song suggestions are hit and miss. Latest updates don't allow non-autoplay. The button is set to off, but no matter what, I get reams of songs I don't want after I play an album. Huge data eater. This needs to be addressed please!"
"So I was a massive fan of this service and the app. And although that is largely still the case. My concern for the frustrating changes being made to the user interface amongst other things. Including only providing 3 pins for my library etc? How is that even a limitation? And why move the playlist, podcast etc, buttons rubbish bubbles inside the library? Cmon guys. How can this be getting worse with time? Your income must be of the charts now. Don't ruin a good thing."
"Guys, you really gotta optimize the new version of the app. It seems like every update breaks the app little by little. I keep getting errors like ""Playback failed"" and the app doesn't want to play the music or the current podcast I'm listening to, and the app freezes sometimes too. More optimization is required."
GET RID OF THIS NOVEMBER UPDATE AND FIX SHUFFLE. I don't know whether it is an algorithm thing but the shuffle feature seems to only shuffle the same groups of songs within a playlist and the best thing about the app which was the car mode and keeping the screen on while in app is now gone with this update and has COMPLETELY RUINED the app for anyone who doesn't have a button on their steering wheel or the damn Spotify car thing. FIX THIS and you will be a good app to use.
"1) The colour distinction under the status bar doesn't make sense when the at the top of the page, and makes the app look like old Material UI design. Moreover, iOS doesn't have this and works as expected only when scrolling. 2) Ask the user if they want to change songs when they tap on a song after having created a queue; it's possible to accidentally tap a song and switch which ruins the environment in social settings"
"Great music player, used it for a couple of years now. However, they are pushing their podcast down you throat which is annoying. There is no settings to disable or hide it. It ruins the home page... Please fix."
"I've had spotify for years. In that time I've been quite happy with the subscribed service. The music is of good quality and the overall library is really good. However, I have recently had little choice but to switch over to the free version, recently. This is due to financial issues resulting from the pandemic. I will return to a paid subscription soon. I have an issue with the free version of the service. They offer you 30 minutes of ad-free service if you watch an ad. Nevaler has it worked."
"Good service, but really annoying that you need a good active internet communication to even listen to downloaded music. Quite frequently you can go to a downloaded album and it just sits there indefinitely trying to load album art and other meta data. It's been like this for about a year, was really expecting a fix by now."
"It's quite nice, but it just don't work right. Sometimes it starts buffering even when my internet connection is good, and sometimes it stops playing songs. Please fix this"
"I'll give it a 3 star because when I started downloading this, it was fun! And I can pick any song to play, but now it got the shuffle mode, there's no even a shuffle mode stop button. Please fix this."
"On mobile, I have to use shuffle play , which is garbage. On tablet, the shuffle play button is there, but I don't use it, making it similar to the PC version. The PC version, is by far the best. Ads are unskippable, but they're not too annoying. I recommend downloading if you are on tablet or PC, but if you're on mobile, YouTube Music is a very good alternative."
Whenever I tried to play a certain song or Playlist it would play some other random song. I don't know if its a glitch or not but its certainly a nuisance.
Spotify mobile is trash my aulbums allways play in random order and sometimes play songs that are not even in the aulbum you also cant skip to parts of the song or just skip the song unless you pay two major issues that just ruin the experience if you ever use it just use it on your laptop or pc
"Spotify has been so good, but you've just got rid of ""car mode"" which is what I loved that the screen would stay on and tge buttons were larger and easier to use. Also my car is not blue tooth enabled so you've screwed my driving experience as well. So sad, please put it back."
"I enjoy Spotify quite a bit, but lately it's been constantly pausing in the middle of songs. Please fix this stupid bug!!!"
"Quite enjoyable when it works correctly. Seems often my family runs into glitches that get resolved by the next update, only to run into different glitches to the update following that. Playlist radio doesn't seem to use the Artist and songs from the playlist, but instead recent songs that I've listened to the most"
"Downloaded podcasts disappear, after about 2 weeks. Which is why I use this app just for music, and the odd podcast that isn't available on Google Podcast (where they stay forever, until you decide to remove them). The other thing that bothers me, is the shuffle button is too small."
"For being such a large company, your UI sucks. It just isn't intuitive or easy to navigate. It isn't any better on my roku either. Spend some time and money making it better and I'll be more likely to use it."
great app but I can't get rid of the songs that are not on my play list. It just automatically changes songs. you need a button to just stop it playing not just pause it
"I still think the app is decent but when I turn on the ""play in background"" setting and it still doesn't work, it becomes a nuisance when I have to repeatedly turn back on my phone just to play music"
"This app has such poor UX. It has become immensely cluttered and difficult to access your most common playlists that you seek out every time to go and use the app. What happened to being able to sort your playlists? Scrolling to the bottom of a playlist thousands of songs long every single time is ridiculous, previously I could have the most recent songs at the top and play it in order that way, why would I want to start the playlist at the very beginning with songs I added years ago."
"I love Spotify, genuinely I do but the free version has gotten a massive downgrade. I can't loop songs, skip more than 6 times with annoying ads in my way and I can't have short playlists because it will add songs I didn't put there playing. I want to have looping songs back and I would also like to able to disable Spotify recommending songs and putting them into my playlists, thanks in advance üòä"
"For me the app isn't that optimised for what I want to do, which is just play individual tracks. Even when you choose an EP/Album, the app proceeds to play what it thinks you want. Not impressed. Makes me think Spotify outsourced the app design but have never actually used it. And being the biggest, have no real inclination to improve. It's easier to use YouTube as a music server as you get what you pick, and the suggestions are not in your face. Or buried in an arcane GUI."
"The app has a poor UI, it is also interesting the podcast I listen to the most never seems to be displayed in my show. Well the listening experience is good, as well as the selection... It's so poorly laid out it takes forever to get anything."
"I'm using S21 Ultra, It's quite buggy. the song that playing isn't the same that shown on the player, the timecode isn't counting too, no matter as I try to close the app and reopen. Eventually I have to force stop the app, and start again. Very annoying, not a smooth experience."
"Pretty good, but could use some improvements: - Google assistant integration in Android Auto is pretty broken (if I search for something Spotify keeps playing the current song even though my search shows up when clicking the search button) - Ability to hide all podcasts - A single queue (the separate ""now playing"" queue leeds to confusion) - Make the big green button ""play"" for albums instead of shuffle (or give us the option to change it)"
I feel user experience could be much better. Things became more messy with time. Also loading times and offline mode definitely need to be faster and smoother.
"The TINY shuffle button on the android app is terrible! What happened to the big green button at the top that was easy to turn on and off¬ø? Why was it changed? The current tiny button is rubbish because no matter how or what I try I can not revert back to normal sequence play! I just want to listen to my playlist normaly. Also, I'd like to be able to edit my playlists with the choice of moving more than one song at a time, If the playlist is large it takes way too long to rearange the songs..."
"The app is good on the phone and it works like a treat in that mode, but it really needs to sort out its podcast feature, especially for car view and smart speaker with video. The UI for Android auto is not an ideal, lots of time I have to take my hands off the wheel to reach the podcast session for too long, also there is no way to visualise only the newest episode in car view in a easy to view playlist. I like it for music but for podcast I'll stick to Google Podcast or Pocketcast"
"The app works great. One thing that should change though, is queuing another playlist while listening to one. The behaviour should be that the new playlist plays at the end of the current one instead of being inserted in the middle of the current one. Or provide an option to choose between both behaviours."
Since the most recent update there seems to be a bug whereby audio suddenly disappears at random even though there is still a paired Bluetooth device and the connection hasn't dropped. I'm using Bose QC35 headphones and a Pixel 5. Skipping around in tracks and changing track sometimes but not always causes the error. Quite annoying as Spotify still thinks the track is playing yet there's no audio even though media volume is turned on in Bluetooth settings. Toggling this sometimes brings it back.
"I have issue on this app, everytime I pressed home button, the music stops! I have had updated this app but it doesn't seem to fix the problem. Please do something about it."
"It is an ok app but you should only use on external things like playstations built in spotify, just add songs to your library and listen on there it will not give unwanted songs or anything I highly recommend you listen on playstations 4-5. It can also be louder!!(use yt music on your phone if you must listen there)"
Spotify has been quite a good app since i started using..but lately it is not functioning efficiently..the songs get stuck in middle..the app is getting hanged frequently even though it is updated!
"Good service, questionable business practices, and constant counter-intuitive updates. Adding features that can be ignored is fine, but removing/breaking existing features isn't."
I keep trying to add songs to my playlist then listen to them but I can only listen to short clips because when I hit the play button on the playlist it plays random songs that aren't on my playlist this sucks I will rate it lower if this continues
"Use it daily, and really like it, but some updates are really annoying. For ex, on the lock screen, the forward and previous buttons for podcasts keeps alternating among not working (now), going to next previous podcast, or going 15seconds forward/back on same episode (my favorite option). For some reason we can't personalize this, and keeps changing. Would like to see more personalization options. Also for music, if accidentally click in ""hide song"" can never find the song again! Has happened."
Works great on Android Smartphones and Tablets. The Wear OS version doesn't allow using the watches built in speaker to listen to music whereas Pandora does allow. Please add this feature.
"i'm a user who doesnt use premium and i normally dont mind the ads, but there's one that i really can't tolerate listening to. i'll be vibing to the music and the ad starts playing and its someone practically screaming into my ear, and god does that ruin my eardrums. please spotify for the love of god consider ads that won't break my eardrums before adding them. sincerly, a spoitfy user tired of people screaming into my ear"
"The music plays in the background while using other apps. Do not know if that will change after the free month. That is why I left YouTube music is it does not play in the background. And you have to keep re-entering the play button halfway through a song if you are on YouTube music. So for Spotify experience for the first free month,for the rest of the time that I will use it,it would rate more than 3 stars. What it is missing is the front page to be more colourful where the photo of the album"
The widget with a big picture never worked properly. It often requires Spotify to be already open in order to access the app. Where as the small never required such
"Updated version looks good but the UI is SLOW... Great app especially in premium otherwise really bad with the ads after you've been a subscriber.. Multiple ads after almost every track..! Almost like they punish you for ending your subscription .. If premium price was lower or bundled with another app like Netflix etc, might be worth it.. Will be checking out Deezer music app."
I wish it wasn't so glitchy. I want to share my Spotify profile with my friends and it won't let me. I have tried setting up Facebook but it glitches everytime I click the button.
The damn thing wont shut down or close what ever. There is know way to exit out of the app. . It sits in the back ground . Therw is know reason to make an app that does not shut down or close its rediulase unless you are trying to get personal info to.sell on the web there is know need for apps like that. I will continue to unistall any app the will not shut down or deos not have close button.
"This Is the only music app I use because I'm so familiar with it and its the only one I have ever used but there are some issues I had recently with the app , like sometimes all it does is load and doesn't actually open ,other times it tells me there's no internet connection even when I have a stable wifi connection, and overall the app can be quite buggy sometimes. as someone who pays for premium this is really disappointing :("
"uninterrupted! What a beatiful word, you've ruined...ads after every couple of songs. If it wern't for my playlist i would have left much earlier for a cheaper alternative. Don't interrupt in the midnight atleast, that won't cost you much rather help you through self promotion."
They removed the equaliser setting on my redmi 9 and its very frustrating because it sometimes automatically enable the equaliser with maximum bass and its annoying. It's also automatically reduce the loudness on my main speaker. Please bring back the equaliser button!
"Pleaaase, stop shuffling my playlists (from my library, when adding song to playlists and so on). It's always so messed up, I simply can't find what I'm looking for without the searchbar. It's so counter-intuitive. I don't know what UX department is doing, but some of their ideas are just not user-friendly."
Been on a premium for years. No issues previously until the last update where the stop play/stop button is hard to control. Please do something about this.
"This app is nice for different music, but the thing is it's not playing the songs i want. For example, i play a song then it plays a different song and not the song i want to play, it's maybe on shuffle mode and i've seen tutorials and they seem to have a shuffle button but i don't. On a computer it seems to be just fine and plays the music i choose."
Best music streaming app. Just need two more functions to be included. 1. Tap and hold to select multiple songs to be added to playlist or queue. 2. Give like button next to song name instead of under options Do this and there's no other app to beat you
"Good selection of music and features, works quite well except it loses your downloaded music periodically. Annoying defect that has been around for ages. Fix that for 5 *s"
"I love Spotify however, when you have songs you've already downloaded they have to redownloaded again with wifi that can be quite annoying. Otherwise I rather Spotify over YouTube."
App was preety much better before but after the new update... When I don't open my Spotify for 2 days because of my assignment.. this app suddenly deleted my liked songs.. and while liking the songs again many adds were shown.... Every add after 3 songs.. It's ruin my experience with songs..
"The WearOS support is now great, although a bit complex, it gets the job done. I moved from YouTube Music and I have to say that phone app was a bit faster, and easier to get to things. I don't quite understand limiting artists top songs to 5-10, just show me a full list, ever expanding, limiting discovery to 5-10 seems arbitrary and just annoying. Daily mixes are cool, I just don't know if they are actually daily, I seem to hear the same tracks- even ones I've selected to block."
"I love spotify but sometimes something weird happens and when I try playing my liked songs it only give a preview, and when playing a song that plays, the loop button is replaced with a minus symbol, anyone know how to fix this?"
"the app is only available in dark mode. No option for light mode, and that's SO PRIMITIVE. Pay some attention to the UI, please. It's a music app, not a calculator!!! secondly, adding an option to import my library from other music services would be great."
I love Spotify premium but the Shuffle playlist button has been taken away (again!). It's been replaced with a play/pause button once you shuffle initially. I like to be able to shuffle my playlist to my hearts content and this glitch is incredibly annoying. Let's see if deleting and reinstalling the app will help......aaaand it didn't.
This was great up till the last update and now I can't skip more than 6 songs in an hour and have a premium button even though on the family plan. And the constant shuffle is awful will go back to desktop only now.
"I have a love hate relationship with this app. When it works it's amazing, but it often has issues especially in offline mode. **I would strongly discourage people from using this app if it's primary use will be offline.** When streaming it's not bad, some performance issues here and there. What I don't understand is why there's been so much effort put into updating the UI which was honestly better before instead of making that app function properly."
"Android Auto app is average at best. Not utilizing the wide screen, it has the like button hidden in a sub-menu and there's no way for me to add the song to a playlist from that sub-menu. I mean, who designed this? I want the like buttons and add to playlist to be 2 extra buttons on the song UI."
"These days too many ads , means it hurts more being a student and being hampered from studies listening to ads every now and then , it was alright listening an ad so often , now they have started streaming a vdo and 2 ads included , means it consumes almost 2 minutes of mine and ruins my mood, Otherwise 2 ads consecutive is compulsorily coming every 3 to 4 songs Please don't play with the emotions of the listeners , Song listeners have great emotions and in every ad they force you to buy it"
There should be shuffle option for playlists too. Also ads are fine as long as they promote other artist's songs or products but guilt tripping people for not using premium with annoying ads is downbad
I loved the app but then the new update came and ruined my experience because when I listen to the playlist SOUR it doesn't give a Olivia Rodrigo song but a harry styles song whyyy?(this happens in every playlist but with a different song each time)üòëüòî
"1) UX not good: on playlist view (which de-facto main screen of user) there's no even Next/Prev song buttons !! I have to open notification bar to skip song, or seek current playlist position where I'm now, or open song view !! This is inconvenient. 2) recommendations are ""repeating"" by nature. I meet alot of songs that already in my Liked 3) Random order and repeat setting - always messed up, not saved what i set it last 4) I'm really surprised that such simple things are not fixed in #1 music app. I've used other app before, and it was working good"
"Needs to stop pushing podcasts on people. I don't care about podcasts, I don't want recommendations for them. Instead of promoting all the ""exclusive"" podcasts on a service I subscribe to for music, maybe close the feature gap with other streaming platforms ‚Äî like lyrics or music videos. You need to warn users when an update has reset some settings ‚Äî this happens all the time whether it's volume normalisation or streaming quality and is a horrible user experience."
"to be honest, the whole premium thing is quite... pointless. i've used spotify for close to a year now, and the fact that i at least NEED to pay in order to listen to my songs on repeat and download it for offline needs is ridiculous. just, let us enjoy listening to our fav music without the needs of money. and plus the price is really high (in malaysian dollars) :/"
I think we a know this app. But there could be more improvements made to be honest. Number one is to get better sound quality. I really would wanna be able to listen to studio type of quality. And I really would love to see quick add buttons to a Playlist.
the app is great and there is a great selection of music but there's so many adds and it ruins the atmosphere of the music a lot so maybe tone down the adds and I can give it 5 stars
"Great app to play music, but I am having some issues with it. Whenever i search for a song to play, I click the play button and then some random song starts playing. I am also concerned about my playlist not playing in order. Please explain what Is happening. Do i need to change my spotify settings?"
"This app is great except for one major flaw. As a mobile user, you can't select multiple songs to add to a playlist, and it's a huge hassle to have to sort through and add each individual song to your playlist. It really messes up the user experience, especially because there are a lot of users who are mobile only. People have been complaining about this for years, but still nothing is being done about it."
first of all dont come at me or judge me by saying sh-- but the limited skips are ridiculous- i cant like move the song a bit forward- i cant press back- i cant move the song a little back- even if i have a playlist the reccomended song keep on coming- so it feels like you just want us to buy premium- atleast make it a bit more easier for people having money struggles- for example make the back button valid- or can move the song a bit forward or a bit back- other than all this its good recommend
"Poor Podcast Player, Good Predictive Playlists. App UI is cumbersome. But, I expect I will get used to it. Worse, Spotify Connect will not allow podcasts to play on my speaker/radio. Music works on the speaker, but the same device cannot be used for podcasts. This is very disappointing. So, if I can't use Spotify Connect, I'll stick with Podcast Addidict which has a far better UI for podcasts."
"It's ok I guess, but it uses ALOT of data, and for some reason it's quieter than any other music app. Not bad, not good. I'll just stick with iHeartRadio."
"Everytime I Shazam music and search on Spotify, it shows no internet connection. Remove the Podcast (shows you might like) Bar from the top instead of recent listened to, it feels highly irritating and harming user experience every time"
Spotify changes the UI often sometimes their changes makes since sometimes it will wipe all of you saved songs and artists. Also app seems to be very buggy if you don't have the latest new phone.
"The mobile version of this app sucks... The gui us really hard to navigate through. When even i tap on a song instead of the song it plays a completely different song. Also you get a limited amount of skip's?! That's ridiculous its like the whole app exists just to show ads and try to make you buy the premium version... To be honest using this app with out premium is a complete waist of time, unless if you want to listen random songs and ads..."
"Lovely, but.. 1. Skip a track using another interface (e.g. car audio) and it gets stuck on the original song. Needs a phone re-boot or app re-install. Ugh. 2. It just randomly stops playing, and needs the play button pressing again. 3. Membership management options are basic. E.g. removing a member from a family subscription doesn't appear to be possible. 3. Playing podcasts is clunky - get a more focused app."
"I originally gave you 5 stars but I'm knocking you down to 3. As of recently your app decides to play music even when it was asking pause. The music starts itself after 30 seconds and it's quite frustrating. No matter what I do, I can't seem to fix the problem."
"2021: shuffle still no worky & a new more troublesome issue- spotify automatically starts when your device connects to bluetooth. Not only annoying but troublesome since one's volume may have been left up on said blue tooth, auto start thus inviting a startle shart. According to community, the auto start is a year's long problem with no solution. And I pay for this service...shart free with subscription I guess. 2019: Please by God and all things holy make the shuffle button actually shuffle!"
"The free version should be comparatively more flexible ofcourse do your business but don't loose the free customers. Another matter is the UI at the managing playlists, podcasts and copying/adding songs from a album must be flexible."
I love it it's great and has most songs on it I have been using it for 3 years now however not all songs are on here and the songs in different languages like Japanese I can't search it cuz it's in those letter it doesn't translate the title to my language which is bad and you do get ads quite often but besides that it is really good as you can listen to podcasts as well as songs and you can make play lists and at the end of the year it shows you you most listened to song and stuff so yeah
Good. But web version doesn't work fine. Suddenly stop playing the song after sometime. We have to revisit the page and click on play button.
"Please put the play button back in the middle of the screen. Too difficult to reach in the far right side for this left-handed operator, and it's too small."
"Why are there still no brighter mode options? Also, how come downloading individual songs are still a hassle with playlists and all. I should be able to retain all songs from downloaded playlists even if the songs on the playlist change. Y'all really should do better. We want a download button next to the 3 dots for options for each individual song"
"ok the UI is top notch. the variety of songs is exciting. but I always have trouble with the downloading and offline listening. I have to open up the app everyday to get all my songs downloaded. the offline listening is a pain to deal with. it says that it'll keep the songs for 29 days without wifi connection but somehow logs me out of the app and I have to download them all over again! my auto-updates are on, the app IS up to date always... and yet! fix this spotify!"
I love the app and everything but in the last update they took out the back button on the lock screen mini player to out the like button. I know I can swipe down to expand the mini player but I honestly think it was fine before. This is just uncomfortable and I wouldn't have updated if I knew this would happen.
It was awesome then started noticing that certain songs I didn't like kept reappearing. The don't like button was almost never there lately. Why pay for something that used to be great but no longer is.
"The app was great at start with very good songs and suggestions, however lately the autoplay button is not working at all although the function is on in the settings. The adds have increased drastically and the app stops after playing 1 song (u can't even press the next button) I've done everything (reinstalled,cleared cache, switched the autoplay button on and off) still the function is not working. Please look into it carefully becoz this is the 2nd time in 2 days when Im reinstalling the app."
"I love Spotufy and have been using it for quite a while. However, if you have the free version- you get ads after every two or three songs and it's really annoying as it's two thirty-minute, unskippable ads."
"The new update has gotten rid of the previous song button and replaced it with the heart button - to go back to the start of whatever you're listening to, you must unlock your phone, go into the app and do it from there. I don't understand why they thought this was a good idea, but makes an otherwise decent app very frustrating to use. Bring back the back button!"
Sort by time button takes three taps before it works on podcasts. It will flip first but then revert back and you have to try again.
"The ""Liked"" button is too close to the Play/Pause button, causing me to remove songs from my Liked songs accidentally. There's not even a confirmation like: ""Are you sure you want to remove this song?"" It just removes it right away."
I love to listen to my music here but I just got 6 ads in a row trying to listen to a playlist. As soon as I clicked the play button on my playlist I got 6 ads back to back. I understand why there are ads but really 6 ads just to finally hear my music. That is ridiculous. But sadly it's not the first time that this has happened to me nor will it be my last.
For the amount of money this app makes... We deserve better. But maybe it's because i use Android still disappointed... The layout is ugly and seems lazy... And it could be so much better... Ugh... Mainly had no issues but also... I would prefere something intuitive.... 3 stars that's all you get. Also I'm not in the car... That message always pops up and it's anoying.... As hell
"Great selection of music, comedy and podcasts. Sound sucks big time no matter how many people have given advice how to tweak settings. Also not very intuitive when it comes to predicting what you like to listen to & suggestions. Needs more work."
"I still use the regular unpaid version and most of the time I love it, however I've actually listened to adverts for well over 5 minutes now, I stopped counting after the 10th one and couldnt quite believe what I was hearing. It doesn't make me want to get premium, I'd rather go elsewhere to get my songs if your advertising is constant and unpleasant."
"I can't complain too much because their UI is pleasant to use and the music they have available is stunning. But holy heck, why does it keep pausing seemingly at random. I don't understand."
"Spotify isn't the worst ever, however it depends on what you are listening on. On phones, you can only shuffle but on tablets, you can swipe and pick songs without paying. The buttons are very annoyingly small and the ads are starting to become a lot more unnecessary and often."
"Music is good but the new UI has taken away so many features and is utterly useless, please for the love of god either change it back or make it useful."
"Only can go skip forward/pause/like songs when phone is closed now. Just add 4 buttons if u really wanted to add the ability to like songs, don't remove skipping to a previous song"
"I don't wrote reviews. I am frustrated enough with the app to say that the glitch g out and quitting out of nowhere sucks. I know I am not the only user experiencing the problem,, and it needs to be figured out. I love spotify but the app needs work."
"One major downside - occassionaly the app says there is no internet connection when in fact there is one and it's good. At that point I have to reboot the phone or delete all app data (not just the cache), which is quite annoying. Motorola G Power, Android 11."
"Cannot edit my previous review, so I shall make a quick response to myself: for some reason a restart of my tablet has fixed the issues- my bad for rushing in to vent my anger. But why did...whatever happened, even occur at all? It was a completely different UI, it didn't let me use my playlists in any convenient way. Why the hell did that even happen? I don't know if I should call it a glitch as it altered the app so drastically."
"I don't know why but when I check my playlist it's not letting me click and hear the full song I added and it's also when I searched up songs I pressed the play button it will give me a different song not the song I wanted to listen too..it's really annoying and if theirs a way to fix it, it would be nice to tell me so I can listen to my playlist in peace."
"Nice app for streaming with a great design. But I would like to give it a full 5 star rating only if, there is translation of lyrics available, there are better playlists of new songs. Please look into this and update it."
"I can't save the song to my playlist using web player in my pc recently. Right click on the song title isn't helping, only able to click the favorite button beside it."
"I really like the app's UI 2. I like that spotify is working with discord so that user can see what they are listening to. but i really hate that theres alot of ad in the music and when it says hear this ad to get 30 minutes of ad free listening but before 30 minutes a ad pops up and for normal listening always 1 minute ad pops up. 3. I like that at currys PC World, you get 3 months of premium. Thats it."
This app is great until they remove the loop and picking the song I wanted to start in my playlist it's only just shuffle and I really got mad because they didn't play the song it supposed to play with another song that I don't want. But I don't really mind the adds. But if they don't return the loop button and the remove the unwanted side songs. I'm gonna switch to another app
Paying for prime but it keeps closing if I try to do anything offline I work at sea so this is essential. Some albums just show a blank loading screen. This is extremely disappointing. I feel it's quite limited. Just paying to not have ads and it seems far too expensive for just that.
"The app with the worst and most annoying and disgusting ads you'll ever hear right smack in between songs, especially engineered to your listening delight to make you upgrade to premium. Keep your finger on the volume buttons and you're good. Otherwise the apps pretty fine."
"Its okay but if i go onto another app whilst spotify is playing music the music stops and also the shuffle play button. I CANT get rid of it! I dont like it and i dont think Its a good feature since if you use sll your skips and for example if you put on Diamonds,a song, Its shuffled with so many stuff like just ONE song we want to put on yet we have to wait for a hundred more to play! I liked it better without the shuffle play! üëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩ"
"I personally used to love this app. But getting 2 ads after every song is just too irritating. It has got too annoying now. The experience was quite good in the beginning. Ads are fine, but after every song, 2 ads?!"
Works well as long as there are no connectivity issues. While on airplane mode was unable to listen to previously downloaded podcasts. UI issues around this.
"I used to love this app when there were no ads and i understand why they added them but there are too many of them. another problem is that i have a playlist i usually listen at night and there is a song that has a really loud part so i removed it from my playlist (or at least i tried) i presed the remove song button some weeks ago and everything was fine but yesterday, when i lisened to my playlist that song was playing and i tried to remove it again but it said it was already removed. solve it"
"Huge song selection, and easy to use UI, but if you don't pay for premium, I don't recommend this app. I've gotten up to 5 ads one time before the next song started and I didn't even get to pick what song I wanted to listen to. The paywall holds too many features man."
"Though it's awesome and all, I hate how they're 30s to 1min ad playing EVERY TIME I want to play a one quick song song. ""Enjoy the next thirty minutes of uninterrupted listening"" even though I want to play simply one quick song. I am not gonna listen for thirty minutes everytime I open Spotify. It just makes me switch to YouTube and never open Spotify until I actually want to listen for long duration."
"Recent updates to the UI have shown spotify cares more about modern design than usability. The music is good of course, but the last couple of updates have really got on my nerves. The first changed the widget on my homescreen so that the rewind, pause and skip buttons are now just their respective symbols instead of having distinct buttons. The next one made the now playing section inside the app hover, meaning you can very easily tap something behind the controls at the bottom. Disappointing."
It's barely functioning half the time or it's loading for quite a long time but it's nice on the rare occasion when it does work. Hey at least works better on the computer then on the phone
"Buggy buggy buggy. Nice that they've reintroduced easy search in playlists but otherwise the app just keeps getting worse. Why does it say no internet connection next to my router? Why does it switch to car mode when I'm in my kitchen? Why does it take forrrrrreeeeeevvvvvveeeerrrr to start playing when i hit play? Why does it randomly forget my listening history? Spotify, you're trying to do too much and it's ruining what made this app great in the first place: listening to music."
"Overall my experience with premium has been great for several years but recently I've noticed an issue when connecting to Bluetooth devices to play music where the music continually skips which utterly ruins the experience. This doesn't happen on any other apps like YouTube, which was my first assumption and it only started after the most recent Spotify update."
"Listen on this phone doesn't work, stops playing. Shows pause button indicating it's playing, but it's not, pressing pause does nothing. There's no variety to the ads, basically hear the same 2 ads on repeat. Some UI elements will sometimes not appear."
"Sometimes hard to do simple things, like on the fly starting the next episode on the podcast I'm currently listening. App is terribly slow (always this loading screen, even without internet connection!). Sometimes it feels like the playlist I want do hear hides from me (a custom, stable order would be nice). Hard to find new music that is different from mine (recommendations only by similarity). They definitely need to get a good user experience designer! Oh, and a meaningful changelog."
It was good until the recent update it won't let me use the backwards and forwards buttons next to the pause and play button they are greyed out. The only time the worked was once and it was only with the forwards button.
"I am premium. Offline mode barely works for loading saved podcasts, and the app itself has trouble loading in offline mode. It would be nice if I could sort by ascending and descending in the sort category, and it would be nice if you kept playing songs from the list I just searched in, instead of the single song on repeat. This app uses to be more fluid and user friendly, and had more artists/songs that weren't only mainstream. Oh and, if you move, you have to discontinue premium then re do it."
"Was and still is a good app but 1 problem, ever since the last update when I'm offline or if app is in offline mode I can't see half of the album because it's being covered up but the album Pic and the shuffle button. I unistalled and reinstalled the app but still the same problem. I hope this gets fixed coz it's really getting annoying üòí"
"With every update it gets worse and worse functionality wise. I can't even put any music on because it believes it's offline, when it's not. It randomly cuts off and stops any music, sometimes if you skim too quickly between songs it completely breaks. Please fix this, I don't want to pay for a broken app."
I've been a premium subscriber for years. Great app but HATE the new layout. If you want feedback from one of your oldest customers..GO BACK to the much more easier on the eye format you had! Too much information now being displayed and the playlist cover picture is smaller now and you can't even click on it anymore to see it full size. Why change things spotify?! I know you have to keep people in employment who work in design..but give them something else to do...like make the coffee.
Although I have spotify premium sometimes the app requires internet connection even though I have the song or playlist downloaded. It also freezes sometimes or keeps playing music even when I closed the app from the background too.
"Songs are all here and all but.. Why would you limit the times people can skip songs? Its not much,it requires premium so skip as many as i like..but why,its triggering for me. The fact that i cant pick what i want to play first in my playlists."
Playlists never load. Random songs play themselves sometimes. The play button is extremely delayed. As is pausing. It crashes a lot too.
"It's a great music app where you can discover new music and play songs depending on the mood. That said, the free services are very limited if anything, it discourages you from continuing to use the app itself rather than paying for premium and the ads are unbearable and overdone."
The current GUI (especially where the song names are supposed to be) is really a problem. Playing songs offline is a nightmare as it has no play button. I have to press on the top left of my screen on a non-existent button to play offline. Please consider taking it back to the previous GUI.
"Hey spotify creator , i am very dissappointed. I downloaded spotify to liten to K-pop music. At starting this app was working so good. The problem was of ads ragarding premium but nothung was wrong in it. But now i can't listen my favourite BTS song's in this. Please solve and reply to my quiery fast."
"Great app BUT listening to music outside your usual genres shouldn't hijack your history and recommendations. Put on some relaxing sleep music and now my recommendations are overwhelmingly stuff I would never listen to, particularly during the day. ASMR......NO! Desperately needs a night/hidden mode or an ability to remove certain songs/genres from history and recommendations. Years of history ruined by one small music diversion!"
I quit listening to YouTube because of all the ads. I pay for cell phone usage and was not happy with all the ads. Now Spotify is on the same course. Let the people decide what they want and quit disrupting the music with all the damn ads!!
"Substandard UI updates, car mode no one asked for, no video when connected to car Bluetooth, bugs including podcasts stop playing after ads forcing a restart, Playlists not up to date until log out/log in."
Streams songs quickly and so many songs to chose from! Oh wow I forgot to mention that the interface is user friendly . Amazing app!
Can't compete with Deezer in terms of lyrics and their availability. Quite upsetting for me. Just switched to Spotify based on false feedback from friends... Sorry. The quality of the audio files seems worse comparing the same tracks served by the competition. Even after I have explicitly selected the best available..
"I'm hesitantly okay with the playlist UI change, in so much as we no longer need to swipe to see playlist duration and the shuffle all (play) button staying visible while scrolling. Now, please, I beg you... Add the amount of songs in a playlist beside the duration. Swipe to queue. And a way to mass select/add songs to a single playlist that isn't the current tedious one by one option or the 'add songs' at the top of a playlist which only shows ur most recently liked/listened to music."
I've had nothing but problems since the added advertisement. Joe got signed and its been nothing but problems. I strictly use Spotify for the JRE and he places ads at the start as to not ruin the flow of conversation. Then these corny ads play and either restart the pod or just stops playing altogether and I don't have the time to find my place again. It's also the reason I stopped using premium because I was getting Spotify ads even though I had premium. Do better
"This app used to work flawlessly but now it's junk, it doesn't play all songs and freezes unless and force stop the and restart it. I may have to switch to a different provide. It's quite unfortunate because I do enjoy the the music selection and features, until yesterday glitchy time. It hasn't stopped."
"Yes the app is good and all. But when i want to download a particular song i have to download the full album, so instead of that the app makers should also make us able to download one song and not necessarily the whole album...and they should add a play next button cause its boring to always go in the app and change songs after songs"
i mostly use this for playing songs on alexa from spotify app.. if i click on play on new album it'll never refresh the UI.. but once I check on alexa new song would have already started long back. everytime must reopen spotify to see which song s being played. these things stop from buying premium plans...
"I have used Spotify Premium for quite a while now, I usually don't have any issues, but here lately, I have to load the app twice to get anything to play, music included. Also, when I try to listen to JRE, I have consistently had issues with it not loading after it plays ads, I have tried updating the app to no avail, I have tried closing and reopening the app, doens't help, no matter what I do, I have to get lucky to actually listen to an episode."
"Great service. The new UI looks nice but needs work. When looking at the discography the filters need to be sticky at the top of the screen so they can be reselected easily, or even better, the app needs to remember the last filter selection used. Currently when you back out of an album the view goes back to unfiltered and you have to return to the top and reset the filters to continue. Currently navigating multiple Albums amongst Singles for an Artist is unnecessarily cumbersome."
"I don't know what happened but, after the last update, Spotify suddenly got worse, I don't know if its because of the different layout of the buttons, but honestly it became really uncomfortable, I find myself avoiding using the app. Overall I always thought it was an amazing app, but this is just not it"
"I use Premium, and I have to say it's quite good, but there are a few things that annoy me- losing downloads after reinstalling (they were supposedly ""saved"" onto the SD card), the glitch forcing the app to stay open and bug out constantly, the fact that the loop button can't stay on loop once you go to the next song (helpful for ADHD/ASD), and that there isn't an option to hide certain 'recent listens' from the home screen, especially if you don't want others seeing them."
This app randomly starts playing music without even pressing the play button. Mostly happens when Spotify is running previously in Android Auto in the car and later the phone is disconnected from the car's system it starts playing music on its own. Also it starts playing the music when a phone call ends even though it wasn't playing any music before the call. !
"Great app with an amazing UI, BUT it frequently tells me that I'm offline and not connected when I very obviously am and not struggling with any other app's connectivity. It also doesn't transition to offline smoothly when I move into a no-signal area, even though I've downloaded plenty of songs for that purpose."
"Crashes constantly if I do anything besides play music. Playlist mgmt is a joke. When playing top hits by an artist it'll feature the same song as separate tracks because one is a single, another is from an album. Also hide this song is in the same place as add to Playlist depending on whether or not you're listenjng to a song. Pretty bad UI if you ask me. Embarrassing app considering how big spotify is now."
"Love Spotify but now you can't like a song from the drop down menu unless you drag it down.. Spotify Lite has this feature why the heck doesn't premium??? Also the hide song button is a pain in the butt and absolutely pointless. If you don't like a song, just skip it. please remove this button or at least move it to the bottom."
"Click the three buttons on the right of a song to open up the options, but it only works half the time when online. Why? It works every time when I've tuned my data off. Please fix this so we can queue songs with ease."
"I've been having issues as even when my phone having the internet connection.. whenever I open spotify, it's shows ""no internet connection"" and I've to restart it again for it to work. also, it's quite slow!"
"I love Spotify and have been premium member forever, but this latest update has ruined the app. On shuffle, after skipping 10 songs the app just freezes completely, then crashes. I've tried uninstalling and installing again and again, but still the same problem. I hope they fix this soon!"
I pay for the Spotify service and I do feel like I get my money's worth but it is very hard to delete things sometimes if it was more clear how to delete them for instance I accidentally touched a podcast that came up and now I can't get rid of it it keeps starting and I just can't get rid of it that's extremely frustrating it should be very easy to delete something it should be in that long list of things so make it more user friendly and intuitive
I have the family plan. Been paying for years. Lately the songs are slow to play. Also they put the like button beside the cast button so I am often unlikely songs when I try to cast. The app used to be great. I'm in the process of creating playlists on Amazon music if spotify doesn't get back right.
"I am facing trouble accessing many podcasts that I find a link for on Google or on the podcaster's social media.. This is a turnoff since I only changed to Spotify for the podcasts.. An example of the podcasts in question are ""Ear biscuits"" and ""ronstadt"" by Rhett and Link the famoud you tubers. I also critique the fact that the main competitor in Mena region actually provides lyrics while an international app like Spotify does not."
"fine for most part. but it updates way too often and they never bother saying what you're downloading in the app store. don't forget to manually disable camera permission, why is that necessary? and it always tells me I can watch a video ad for 30 minutes of ad free music but it stopped showing me a ""watch video"" button years ago so it just sits in silence waiting for me to respond without giving me a way to respond, then plays their regular audio ad. feels on purpose to worsen free version"
Everything is good . But improvement is needed in some areas like showing recent played songs and search... I think it's easy to show all the recent songs alone rather than showing it like an album and moreover sometimes you miss the songs too. Simply show the last played songs but no you want us to search that again and what if I forget the song name... You have good collection of songs I must say that's why I have to give 3 star. But please improve your layout design how to show songs.....
"Podcast problem: I pay for this app but I don't want to use Spotify for Podcasts. This means I have two problems: 1) Spotify keeps recommending podcasts on my feed which I cannot hide 2) They are paying and using tools such as Anchor to make podcasts exclusive to Spotify which means I cannot listen to those shows on apps of my choice. Design can be better, more in line with Android's material design. Google Play Music does this so well."
"The interface looks ok, but works as if someone who hates the people who like music designed it with the sole purpose of not letting us listen to what we want. They'd rather force upon us their idea of what we like. Seems like a good idea, but in the end it won't turn out to be. Think Yahoo. :) Just to make it clear, I want to be able to move through queue back and forth, skip songs, return, save it all, change order, to be able to combine playlists I made and so on. You know, normal things."
"I am not able to go to the next song when using my car's button when connected to Bluetooth. I used to before. And I am still able to, when I am using Youtube, so I know that it's not my car infotainment that has an issue, but spotify itself. Hence down to 3 stars"
"fix. the. queuing. like. please. ugh. why does it keep playing suggested songs, when there are a lot of songs that haven't been played on the playlist yet? it's so annoying."
"- Offers many of the features its competitors offer, its a decent app. - There is one significant bug and also a very useful feature that could be fixed. On my Xiomi phone, Spotify freezes nearly every time I hit the ""options"" button next to a song or album; so I can't add songs to playlists or do much else apart from play playlists I've made on a desktop. I'm also not able to combine or split playlists, or multi select songs for adding to playlists. That would be *very* useful."
"The playlists designed for me are great. Wide selection of music. BUT HATE THAT I CAN'T ACCESS MY OFFLINE/DOWNLOADED CONTENT WITHOUT THE INTERNET. it's a scam and u will lose subscribes due to this. That NO INTERNET CONNECTION thing whilst I'm fully connected n it lags due to that,it really sucks. I wasn't already a subscriber,I wouldn't have gotten on it."
"If you pay for it it's awesome but the free version is just awful with the most obnoxious advertisements, designed to make you want to pay, in order for them to go away. We also never got to enjoy the full three months trial as Google suddenly decided they didn't like the fact that our rural wireless was ""unprotected"" The google home speaker just suddenly stopped working, no warning beforehand. Spotify of course were uninterested. It's always all about the money. Took weeks to figure it out.üò≥"
"A lot of glitches; repeat button not staying on, not playing music no matter how many times I click, it playing a different song than what I click on, music randomly stopping."
This app is quite good. Although some songs are not available on this app . This app takes time loading the playslist and becomes more slow..with the upcoming updates...
"My Whole Experience With This App Is Of Very High Highs And Very Low Lows. If, By Any Chance, You Happen To Be Using Spotify On A Tablet, I Can Happily Say Your Experience Will Be Exteremely Good, As The Ad Supported Plan On The Tablet Edition Does Not Require You To Listen To A Shuffled Version Of Playlists And Albums. The Phone Version, However, Is A Godawful Nightmare. Not Only Will It Only Play Shuffled Versions Of Playlists And Albums, But It Will On Adding Random BS, Defeating The Purpose."
They took out artist selection. So i cant really play all of one artist. I have to go album of artist. Just a big inconvenience for me. If they bring it back. For sure 5 stars. It against ask for a rating. My rating stands. Plays music great but it's ui interface is very poor.
"Service is good, app leaves something to be desired. Has issues with android auto and requires clearing cache/data and reinstalling the app periodically."
"The UI unnecessarily cluttered & song recommendations based on current song you are playing like in YT Music is not available only the audio quality is magnificent,which is softer on your ears while using headsets."
It was all good in starting but now they give me two ads right after two songs......its quite irritating...you cannot push us so much hard to buy your premium....except for that spotify is best music app ever....hope you do something about those ads..
"I absolutely love Spotify but they have some glitches to work out. I have a good phone and quite often it will freeze or won't load or play even after I delete and reload. I work where there is no phone reception so this is difficult. On the rare occasion, I have lost all saved playlists. When it's good, great music, great suggestions and very user friendly which is why I am still a member. It also keeps going into carview when I don't want it to despite my settings."
Can I go back to a previous version? This new appearance is quite a deterrent. I've liked the app until now - other than the occasional connection error when I'm away from wifi.
"Instead of working on things everyone has had issues with for months, like the app crashing in the background constantly, Spotify devotes resources to gimmicks like ""here's your dream artist dinner party"". I don't care to know that I played Drake after listening to Marcus King Band, Spotify. I'm tired of having to continuously restart the app because it quits working for no reason. Stop with the BS and fix your UX. I'm tired of paying for a sub-par service."
Really nice experience from the UI side.little bit of optimization is required.then I'm really disappointed by the quality of ads...some random guys telling you to buy premium plan.its really annoying.and I would like to see a feature like:a quick add to playlist button on current playing menu...so I can easily add the songs to specific playlist with one click...that will really helpful...thanks
Since the last update i can't see my playlists in the music folders anymore. I can find them if I use the searchbar but thats quite annoying as you can imagine.
"I love using this app every where, the thing is, I can't listen to any song I want, the only way I can do that is by purchasing premium. I don't have the money for it at all, another thing is that my little brothers phone allows him to choose whatever song he wants. I really hope you remove the shuffle play button from the playlists, or the songs, so then I can peacefully listen to the song that I want to listen to without it changing my mood with songs with different moods. It's annoying."
Spotify is good but they don't always have the specific song that you're looking for. Also recently mine will just randomly stop working and will necessitate a restart of my phone in order to be fixed temporarily. Quite an annoyance I would give higher rating if this could be fixed.
Love Spotify but not a big fan of the new layout. Granted I can see the purpose of this new layout is to make it more app-like but it will take quite some time to get use to. The Spotify sessions are also extremely bugged but that is still in its beta stage. Would love to have a complete working version soon!
"I've been using Spotify for quite some time now, but recently the app has been freezing right when I open the app. Because of this, I can't even use it because nothing works."
The app has been super glitchy with podcasts lately. It says I'm playing one thing but something else is playing and the pause play button changes but doesn't do anything. It's very annoying
"UPDATE: it happens since the time counter, under the clip, stops updating, and so 15 sec jum works from last position it still worked.. 15 seconds buttons jump , sometimes, to random locations in podcasts."
"My Spotify app has been ridiculous lately.., it stops podcasts several times an episode,. it freezes on play and I have a restart my phone to get it to stop playing. The home screen freezes on an episode and will play other things, but the buttons don't work because it's a frozen screen."
"With the last update Spotify barely works with my Bluetooth devices in terms of control. Hitting the pause button doesn't pause, and skip won't skip. Manually hitting the pause button on my phone just pauses and unpauses instantly. Along with others I've seen here, the track being played isn't the one on my display, it will tell me I'm listening to a podcast from three days ago when I'm not. The updated library got worse, I can't sort my podcasts by newest released episodes"
"Does what you want it to, most of the time. Also if ad's could be like 10 db quieter it would be nice, then I might be able to hear myself think. Edit: I SAID QUIETER NOT LOUDER. Edit 10/7/2020: they just keep getting louder. Edit 11/1/2020 The ads are blowing out my speakers, they are so distorted I literally don't know what they are even for anymore EDIT: ads are better now, but the find out how you listen thing is stupid"
Continuous problem of randomly pausing music/podcasts for no reason. The quick fix of logging out everywhere is only temporary.
"Now playing is buggy as hell. Doesn't show what I am listening to. It is stuck on a podcast I played yesterday. Clicking download button on a podcast's list resets the sort by / filters I put in to search back to original filter which is of the latest uploaded. It does this every click on the download. Other than that, it is okay. I guess."
"please stop updating the ui and fix it. the updates are causing issues instead of fixing them ‚Äî nothing is accessible, no images show, and ""no internet connection available"" pops up. songs randomly stop and start, i have to restart a million times to even load. mobile < pc spotify, if i'm honest."
"I've been a Spotify premium member for around 7 years, and at the start this app was fantastic. Now however, the ui is extremely laggy, there is at least one pop up everytime I start the app asking me if I want to listen to a band/artist/podcast/upcoming show that I don't care about which slows down the start time, and it loses connection to my echo constantly (could be the echo too, that's another topic). This app is bloated, fix it."
Quickly got all my songs and many more. Great system for making playlists. The ads Every time you play music are seriously turning me off. Pandora doesn't do that.
Listening to ad to get 30 minutes of no ads is not accurate. Law suit for false advertising. I would be nice to remove recommendations made by Spotify like podcasts especially when its something I'm not interested in.
"New update sort of ruins it. Can no longer scan through a song, every playlist is shuffled. What a pain to use now. It was WAY better, no looking for an alternative."
"New update has many glitches, also Spotify changing the way it sometimes auto downloads things to your save just is beyond frustrating too. If I build a playlist or save a file I don't need it to auto download."
"The app was good. Until two updates ago. Before, I had one search bar in my desktop app. When I key in a word, media containing those words populate the screen. Under the songs category, media from my local drive are shown first and then those from the web. This works for me since my music is a hybrid of local songs and songs from the web. I can directly go ahead and add the local media to a playlist directly from the search results. Now that doesn't happen anymore. Only media from the web are shown in search results. You have to open the Local Files folder to search for local songs., which is a hassle. Is there a way to go back to that UI? Also, in my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, some weird things happen. At times, the notification bar would show two songs playing on Spotify. One is the song currently playing while the other is a stating media that's always there. I have to swipe twice to remove the notification. And the problem persists until the next time I restart my phone. It doesn't happen in my Vivo, by the way."
"I dont use this very often because I have Amazon Music. but when I do use the app and I want to go to an artist, it always says ""something went wrong"" dispte restarting the app multiple times. Quite irritating."
"I really can't understand why the user experience on my Galaxy Tab is so horrible. For ages the autoplay functionality hasn't worked. After spending an hour with Spotify support no idea why except it randomly works on some albums but not on others. Also very slow to load up, constantly tells me there is no internet connection yet I am getting 40mbps and other apps working fine. I've been using for a number of years and other devices have no issues except for my Samsung Tab."
"The apps pretty good but I have one quire, I can't navigate my playlists any more or choose were to start listening from. You also can't move songs within your playlists"
"I use this app for work. I have personal playlists that I used to quickly access by going to ""My Library"" and having it set it so my playlists are the first thing to pop up. The latest update made it so I get a jumble of albums and playlists (which if I wanted I would just use the home page), and then I have to click through to playlists->downloaded in order to see my work playlists first. Please allow us to revert our library to the previous layout if desired."
"I have been using Spotify since 2009, and I have been a unlimited/premium member since it was possible, paying around $10 each month for 10 years. That's over $1000... The app has suddenly become a complete mess and wasting my time working around the app, even after the new design. But the worst part is the terrible podcast player, which freezes and stops the episodes, timeline is all over the place, not playing episodes after how you sort the episodes of the podcast and much more. FIX THIS!!!"
"App keeps freezing and lagging. I need to restart it multiple times before it starts working. Also, the new ui sucks!üëé Fix your app.....app is unresponsive...for god's sake. I just want to listen to music."
"We want ""slide gesture"" for ""add to queue"" in android too. And search option is quite long process. You guys changed every simple option to complex one. It's a struggle sometimes to use spotify on Android. We want spotify to be more user friendly than it is now, cause we pay for it."
"It's switches to different playlist on its own and I don't even have the playlist liked, it's one I use to have liked. I wish you would add a block button to we could block playlist"
"Every update seems like it ruins the app for about 2 weeks then it works fine again until the next update. Currently it will randomly stop playing, fail to show the progress while listening to a song/podcast, fail to change songs/podcasts when selected, and fail to start and pause when listening."
They have larger numbers of membership ads then the songs. So it cause to change your mood due to appearance of ads again and again. It is quite unexpected from spotifyüòî.
After leaving a Playlist the wrong song is displayed. It is quite infuriating. A temporary fix is shutting your phone off but it only lasts until the Playlist is changed.
"Eq needs work. When implementing the EQ function on this, for an overall better experience, it instantly becomes incredibly quiet and unusable over any kind of power equipment through earbuds."
"Gets the job done, but even after the recent UI update, you STILL can't create Playlist folders within the app. Come on, people have been asking for yeeeeears now."
"The latest update has made the slightly lag absolutely ridiculous. The load time is SO slow now, especially for the library, the grouping of playlists/artists/albums is unintuitive, and it's still failing to recognise internet connections even when I definitely have one. spotify is convenient but god the android app is leaving a lot to be desired lately."
I wish it would stop continuing to play the same track sometimes even after the track is done so that nothing is played until I open back up the app to skip the track. There's been some other bugs preventing music from playing but that's the most common one I've dealt with.
Works great so long as you have a strong wifi/data connection. 4G is not enough it seems. Also the new update made my library an absolute mess. Downloaded music just randomly undownloads itself. I work in a building with spotty connection so I use offline mode frequently. Also would like to be able to select multiple songs/albums/podcasts at once to speed up creating playlists or deleting things.
It had been working well and I even got the subscription but alongside the whole chaos this app has been giving me serious headache the every other time I try to open it my id is always logged out again I have to download my songs and podcasts and then they show errors with connecting to servers a legit good thing got ruined
Was great but the newest update has made a bug that sucks. When I'm in offline mode and try to queue a song it crashes. Also not a fan of the new ui. Other than that this is a great app for listening to your favorite songs and podcasts.
"Great but kinda janky at times. The notification tab for the app still has songs I search and played for a week ago. Sometimes, it will crash or ""short wire"" it self randomly to were it'll skip or turn off while the song is playing. But I'll say I like the upcoming and current changes to the UI."
"As a music player the only thing that I have experienced bad was, to load or open the local songs, so please fix this problem ASAP, then it will be OPüî•.Other than this everything looks fine, but still even if you have to do edits, then it would be best option for you guys to go for simplifying the UI for easy user experience, so as to get still more user reach.(while reviewing this app I kept only backend and fronted in mind not the actual algorithm using which it works)"
"Great app, had it for many years but they NEED to add a feature where you can remove multiple songs from a playlist at once. Accidentally imported over 5000 sound bites from my phone and its ruined my Liked playlist since Spotify automatically 'likes' anything you import. Have to 'unlike' them one by one which would take hours. Can't us PC for this either. Has killed the app for me."
Why does my forward button not go down the list of my playlist anymore...? If I play the top song I can't forward to the one below it... Would like this to get fixed. Seems like a very unnecessary and annoying update.
"Last update made the UI a pain to deal with, before all my music and podcasts would be organized, now when I open it I have to organize myself everytime. Go back."
Absolutely loved this app until the latest update. Now things move around and navigating something as simple as alphabetical order on your library requires filters. If it aint broke...don't fix it.
The new layout has made it much more difficult to use. It seems with each new update they find a way to make the app worse. There are issues with not connecting and being slow to load and often just not working at all. Premuim is a good service and I will continue to use it but I wish Spotify would go back to how it worked a few years ago.
"Honestly before this update I would have rated the app 5 stars. So many years of finding great music. So it's such a shame in this latest update they have made it harder than ever to find all that music, why has the emphasis on categorised music been dropped? It now takes significantly longer to locate the songs / podcasts. In a quick fix I've unfollowed a few handful of artists to find my playlists, not only hurts me but the artist. Please bring back the smarter and cleaner overview."
"I used to love the app until you began bombarding me with advertisements after every two songs. Now the app does not even work on my phone, the play button is missing. So I uninstalled it and now use one of your competitor's apps. So sorry, but you are going from good to bad to worse. And yes, I am not paying, because I am not interested in downloading and skipping every few minutes."
"It is the best music streaming platform. Sadly the download function is very buggy, often requires complete redownload and/or full erase re install to work"
"Spotify kills the perfect mood with annoying ads. They have good UI, good Playlist, original authors and different genres and easy to select songs for situations, but these ads are a disappointment"
"Spotify is great, however the updates are often questionable as to usability and the recent update (05.05.2021) makes everything unnecessarily difficult and chaotic. I'll be happy to go back to 5 stars once the sorting of music and podcasts is once again more intuitive and the app is faster, like it used to be."
"1. Interfaces getting less logical - hiding play order buttons and search in playlists is not the way. 2. Daily mixes don't get new artists, and after a few years of using are repeating."
With each new update the UI and user experience keeps getting worse. It was great at one point but then they changed it and it kept getting worse!
"Worth paying for, but has issues. I've loved having a family plan for quite some time now, but after recent app updates it's become more frequently unresponsive and many reviews are showing this is a common issue."
"Convenient, easy to use. The apps constantly needs to be force stopped because it gets stuck, the current playing song doesn't update in the UI."
Obligatory comment about the god awful microphone button that's always visible even when voice commands are disabled. Every app doesn't need a separate voice assistant.
"There are some great features to Spotify but sadly the software is quite shaky, particularly when using a smart phone as a remote to control a desktop PC (which feeds the audio throughout the house). The latest general problem is that the ""add to queue"" function has simply ceased to operate. I'll give it a few more months to see whether Spotify improves, then investigate alternative music streaming providers."
The pause/play button sign is not visible when dark mode is on otherwise app is good. Also you need to improve your search algorithm its very hard to find a song
"My expectations from spotify premium were set quite high and turned out to be disappointing. The app keeps crashing, and another problem I'm not sure if everyone faces, but my downloads keep redownloading. Why would i download them in the first place if they're going to have to be redownloaded everyday. Fix the glitch spotify."
"I have had spotify for about 4 years now, and I used to really like it. I don't have premium becuse it's not in my budget, and recently they have gotten out of hand with ADs. I will get three at a time every two songs, and when the 'watch a short vid for 30mins of ad free' comes up i only get through like two songs before another one. Its genuinley rediculous. They have got over captalized to say the least, you cant even pare devices without premium now."
It worked as it should until 2 days ago. If I click the sort button it just scrolls down the episode list (podcasts) and if I open the episode page the big green play button doesn't react at all. Hope this helps to fix the bug.
"it signs out, and for singing up again it says i need to connect but it doesn't do nothing by clicking on the connect button, the only possible solution is deleting the app and downloading again, and i have to download again and again my playlists."
"So I love this app. Easy to listen to music while drawing and playing games. There is one thing I hate about this app though. Is I make my playlist and it's ruined by the ""What we added"" It's annoying that you add songs I hate remove this feature please. Thank you."
"For free users : the music quality is pretty good For premium users : it works the best But there are some bugs 1)On my phone for some reason the Spotify notification is not working it's stuck on a song only 2) when I use free account , I hear more ads then music tbh 3) there are some more minor bug improvement required for computer , example , the ad doesn't play on my computer it keeps loading until I have to close Spotify and open again"
"This update is pretty bad.. Cuz my playlist takes forever to load n the home page takes to long to load n my songs keeps pausing over n over n where is the library, search, n home page button? üò£ pls put it back to previous update üòñüòñüòñüò£"
"At first when i started using it in 2020,it was all great. Premium is only for disabling ads and play songs offline. And now everything has to be premium and those songs that does not require premium features are left,which all of them i dont like. Cmon we are not rich people. The reason we use spotify is bc it uses less internet which also reduces our spending on top ups."
It still works well but the redesign of the app layout isn't as easy to use as before. If it's not changed before the ¬£2 price rise in June I'll be changing to a competitor.
"My Playlist (downloaded) gets undownloaded everyday, the Playlist has over 400 songs and downloading them everyday has become a nuisance, it has been happening ever since I bought premium, what is the use of premium If they get undownloaded everyday, my experience with premium has been very bad lately."
Not a fan of the latest Android app redesign. It is irritating to navigate through and buries the history of listening in a long daily scrolling which isn't as useful as the previous method.
Ad policy is the worst. Ads comes just after each track . Please revise your ad Policies. Listening experience is best. UI is also very easy and hassle free.
"The interface is intuitive and Spotify Radio is remarkably adept at finding songs that fit my taste. However, there are issues the app has suffered from for years, and which remain unaddressed in spite of numerous user complaints. One is the fact that after updates, all downloaded material is deleted, and must be manually re-downloaded. Additionally, the app is known to fail to load and require one or multiple force stops. If these links were ironed out, I'd rate this app 5/5 stars."
"After last update went downhill. Audio stopped playing on podcasts I started listening to after a little bit and would have to restart the program and now wont show video on it. Great app but hopefully they can fix this issue quick and hopefully doesnt happen to everyone. The ads are getting ridiculous on the joe rogan podcast but hey overall good app. Would be 5 stars but after these issues will see how long to fix, april 17th wont play video on podcasts"
Several syncing issues. I use it with Google Chromecast Audio for quite some time now. Latest update made the app unusable as the display freezes to a random song and you can't know which song is playing or control it appropriately. Please give the option to roll back to the previous version of the app.
"First ads suck second im on another account with premium but it expired so i have to deal with adds limited skips it sucks and mostly ruins the mood especially when the adds say ""do you hate interruptions? Blablabla"" it just makes me wanna download premium but i cant because i dont have money yet. Although interruptions suck atleast i found good music.but sometimes(almost always) i goes to a song not in my playlist and i would always use all my skips just to go a song in my playlist"
"The app is user-friendly yes, the music quality is awesome too but when it comes to 30 mins ad-free music i'm quite dissatisfied. 30 minutes is just 10 minutes or just 2-3 songs and then there comes an ad playing again. I would give a 5-star rating if this feature is as effective as the app states it."
"There's no canvas feature anymore for my premium account. And when i try to activate it, the button is not there. Please fix this, i really like the feature."
I used to really like spotify because there werent so many ads but recently I noticed there have been ads quite frequently like I listen to 2 songs then ads and then 2 more songs and more ads and its really repetitive and it's quite annoying
"Not a bad app per se, just that some rarer songs are not always available. Just saying. Also, it tends to be quite laggy on occasion."
"I like Sopity as a Music streaming service and I used to love UI, but recent changes are just so poor, I can't believe I am stuck with this for a Year, its slow and design is not user-friendly at all, specially my playlist menu."
"Normally really good but recently has been deleting playlists, removing songs from playlists and getting stuck on repeat... Please stop making this app worse ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Since the new update my previously downloaded podcasts can only be accessed when online which defeats the point. Also everything getting added to ""my episodes"" is really annoying and it takes 4 online clicks to remove them from there. Also now I can only access the menu for a track when online. Also the new layout is not intuitive"
This app is ok. Nothing special. Tons of adds. freezes up alot. Have patience and tolerance. This can cause a bunch of stress quickly.
"1. The recent change to the Library is unhelpful. Merging the separated music and podcasts sections, replacing them with a set of filters and sort options that you have to keep reconfiguring when switching between music and podcasts, is unnecessarily fiddly and confusing, especially on the go. It was much more intuitive and easier to use before. 2. It would help for there to be a button in the Now Playing UI to quickly access the Queue."
"The ""Not Now"" button has been n functioning as the ""Watch Now"" button for a long time. Please, fix it. It's really aggravating. I don't use the app as much as I used to. I have just been ordering the CDs of the bands I streamed before."
"the newest update ruined the experience for me, unnecessary shuffling when i want to listen to a song, so many ads for your premium service, all in all, the update is terrible Update: its still kinda bad, i just want to be able to listen to a song and loop it without listening to 50 OTHERS"
"I love the fact that it curates playlists based on what you've been listening to and the daily mixes never really miss. It's a good app to use for music if you don't know what kind of music suits your mood and even if you're a regular music listener like me, you'll really enjoy it. All this is after you pay of course....If you're using Spotify free, it's awful to use, and they basically hoax you into paying for premium because the Free experience is absolutely rubbish."
This app is quite good . Has great sound quality . But the irritating point of it is gives too much ads even in the middle of a song .
If you download pod casts because at work you don't have a signal. It can't find it forever almost always. Even if you leave it open when you walk in the building.
"App is good but please stop giving(change) those frustrating ads... Those people speaking in ads are literally begging in front of listeners every 10 mins to take membership of a premium account. It is very frustrating. Ads can be of any product, but every 10-15 mins someone is speaking in your head to ""please.. Please switch to primium.. Every one has.. "" Is quite frustrating."
"at least they fixed the bugs. for about half a year this app was a nightmare to use because of its bugginess. now it's back to its normal state: it works, but there are problems. horrible load times, slow and inefficient ui, constant connection errors. also skip this one if you have a slow phone! the payed service is great. their music database is vast. however, the app is still pretty inconvenient."
"App used to work well on my old phone. On android 11, it stops the music every time a button in any other app is clicked that has sound. Any idea how to fix this?"
"Good app but unless you have premium you cant listen to it offline and you cant download anything! And after your premuim ends, it delets all the downloads! So if they had that fixed i wouldn't delete spotify."
"It fulfills most of my requirements but the ads are so SLANDEROUS that it gets me annoyed most of the time. The marketing team should have some decency before advertising like ""don't you have friends?"" Or ""who will you choose your family or me? and all different kind of lines. It used to be better when the ads were just to the point. I hope you guys take action on this cause these ads aRe NoT CaTcHy but Maligning for non-pro users. Ty"
"Great app. I don't like the new template design for sharing tracks on instagram, the font and the asymmetry of the album cover placement is very unappealing."
"I've been having this recurring problem where this error keeps popping up ""spotify can't play in the background"".It only seems to be resolved after i reinstall, tho the problem keeps happening again after awhile. UI-wise, it would be helpful to have a button to select multiple songs to add into a playlist etc. Rn we only can add them one by one which is a bit frustrating. Also, would be more convenient if the search bar for playlists is at the top instead of having to click the 3 dots"
Been using for quiet a while now but ads keep popping up after every two songs which is very annoying... yeah ads is necessary for the free version but this is going too far.... Love the app tho
It's good but it's quite glitchy and when I turn my phone to landscape or portrait it goes to the start of the document it's gets very irritating I would be rate it better if it didn't have this please fix it and the adds are even worse every time I have to go to a different pdf it shows me an ad that to the same ad over and over and over again! Please listen to me and please change these stupid things
"It's good but they keep adding random songs to my playlists, and it won't let me play the songs from the playlists!!! Please fix this!!üò°üò° Other than those things its great, lots of variety, and is pretty quick moving."
"It gets the job done,but after experiencing google products,the user experience is indeed vastly different.Needs some fine polishing around the nudges. The app is a bit wonky on android. Running background freezes it up sometimes.Also connection issues,the app refreshes the connectivity status only when on homepage."
Lots of bugs. If i login with number i can no longer merge with my previous account which was logged in with fb ( why are secondary indexing keys mutually exclusive here ?). Subscription plans not accessible from mobileapp. Have to login to web app. Should have better UI and shortcuts for group sessions. I love everything else though.
Bring back the diss likes if I don't like a certain artist ut ruins the playlist having to stop everything and skip their songs each time it was easier then having to go through and hide each song on every playlist.
"Its a good app, i really like when i play a certain song it plays a song that has the same vibe and all, But it does *not* play the song i wanted unless i have premium or a pc. I don't quite enjoy that. If you could look into this just a tiny bit i'd be happier"
"Not a bad app for music. But really sux when making a playlist. You can't add albums, you have to add individual songs, which really sux if you have an extensive library. Be great if this could be improved, especially when you are a premium member. Would be great if you could just shuffle the music in your library, instead of having to go through thousands of songs in your library to make a playlist. Other than that, it is ok. Awesome selection available past and present."
Podcast functionality is really buggy. Randomly stops. Randomly resumes from an old position. Randomly shows the play/pause button in the wrong state
"Used to be great have spotify and all my playlists loaded on to my cars headunit, used to just start the car and off i go with music playing, now it requires a constant internet connection to play ANYTHING which is bollocks to be quite honest"
"Latest version 8.6.2.774 ""Shuffle"" play button does not work in landscape mode. It does wok in portrait mode. Same problem on multiple devices."
"I'm getting really tired of Spotify shuffling all my music by default, and if I'm listening to a Daily Mix, the button to fix it is taken away. If I didn't want to know what song(s) were coming up next, I would pay for Sirius XM instead."
It's an outstanding app amongs various other music streaming song. Best Feature is that it requires minimum mobile data to run lots of music online. I rated 3 star because of lots of advertising in between songs it just ruined it.it
Premium user. Didn't there used to be a simple way to see library by Music or Podcasts in the Library UI at the top? Seems I cannot find a library of downloaded or saved podcasts. App and Firmware up to date on Samsung Note 10 as of posting. Now it appears that downloaded Podcasts will use up space but I can't locate them easily to listen or delete them.
"Spotify crashed every time I opened it. Then it played 3 seconds of each song and stopped. I contacted Spotify customer service. They responded quickly and helped fix the app. The solution was a total, clean reinstall. Because of the customer service I am giving 3 stars."
So at first this app was great but then after a week of using it whenever I want to play a certain song a different song would go on And I found this very annoying I would rate this a 5 but it is quite annoying.
I love this app has lots of great Christian music but you need to add a repeat button I hate when it stops. I listen to music all night long or I don't sleep at all! Great app but you need to add a repeat button.
"Recently this app become abysmally slow. All the time when I open app it needs to download something and while doing that it doesn't load playlist, play music etc. A lot of music is missing from my playlist, while they are available in itunes. Thinking of switching. + It's not as pleasant experience to listen to podcasts in this app as for example google podcasts. Thank you for ruining JRE for us and I don't mean content, but the way we have access to it. Really ""love"" this exclusivity bs."
"I hate their ""suggested songs""! Wasting my skips, to the point I am leaving this app quite often. I already know what songs I like, and ones I don't! Not interested in Justin Bieber! Gut this from your app, and maybe I'll return."
"Good app, it's got a great catalogue of music, but I'm really annoyed by the download limit of 10 thousand songs, which one can reach pretty quickly if you can't afford to use mobile data."
"Occasionally, after the app returns to a podcast I was listening to after displaying an add on screen, the podcast doesn't resume where it left off but rather much further into the broadcast..this has happened a few times now and I thought it was user error at first but quickly learned this to be an issue with the app itself"
Worst app on Android for Podcasts. Especially longer one's like The JRE. I pay for zero ads yet still get ads. Constantly pauses every couple minutes. No video playback while connected to bluetooth. No audio only option to reduce data consumption. 3 hr Podcasts are in minutes & seconds like a song and not Hrs/mins/sec. The 15 sec skip button will get stuck and revert back to the last time you used it on the timeline of the podcast. The podcast part of this app needs serious work.
"The app is quite good but one thing makes me disappointed from this app that there are too many advertisements that disturbes me . The advertisement should be there but in a limited quantity but once a song get finished a advertisement starts , thats why i give 3 stars only."
"Lack many features that gaana have but I loved it because of it's lightness. A song can even be played with a 3G network without any hustle. The UI of the app is so nice. If it includes all features such as manually changing the song order, large collection of songs etc.. Will make it the perfect one. Please bring animations as in power ramp"
"Good and clean UI. But homescreen feels not too good, it needs a revamp. Needs to add more payment options like through Google or is it a problem."
"The overall experience is great. But I am currently having issues with the canvas option. I want to share the snippets of videos of the song on insta stories, but they don't appear. Even if I have activated the canvas button. Please reflect on it. Otherwise Spotify is the best music app‚ù§Ô∏è"
"This app is okay but theres some lack. For example, my downloaded songs are gone and it need to be downloaded again. If i was at home, its okay because of my wifi strength but when im outside, i had to use my mobile date which is quite slow. Please fix it"
"Spotify itself is a fantastic platform. Premium Spotify is well priced and I certainly enjoy the features that Spotify has. I can't give the app more than 3 stars due to poor UI/UX design. The app has been optimised for casual listeners who want to listen to and hoc playlist on shuffle. It isn't well designed for users who want to save particular artists and build up a regular discography to follow. Previously you could filter the artists you liked alphabetical, this has been removed."
Why is my sort button not working? Podcast episodes are auto sorted by recently released which is cool except just starting and theres over 100 episodes and I need to scroll all the way to the bottom just to start. Which is a minor inconvenience but still why have a sort button there if nothing happens when I tap it?
"Okayy basically if you subscribed to a premium you'll get the luxury of listening to songs that you want to hear.. but recently I decided to unsubscribe and just listen for free because why should i pay for a month if I'm only gonna listen for like a few days in a month.. it's not worth the money, I'm being wasteful.. i created new playlist to listen the songs i want to listen on repeat but no, spotify keep playing songs randomly that's not even on my playlist and i can't even skip them üò§üò†"
The interruption between the playlist by advertisements is quite often which is sometimes irritating. And almost all the ads tell you to buy premium subscription so that you enjoy ad free music.
"It was going great till Jan 2021. Dont know what happened, but the song doesn't play no matter what I do. My internet connectivity is perfect, I am able to access all other apps but not Spotify. If i click tge play button, nothing happens. Have been trying since the beginning of Jan. Please look into it ASAP!"
"Podcasts need serious optimization, re-design. Podcasts need a toggle for quality of video. Not everyone has 1080p or more stream quality. Please toggle download as audio only as the default setting. Search engine for podcasts is terrible. Just make a separate page, for podcasts only. Errors are frequent during use. I still use my old podcast app for 95% of podcasts."
"Amazing content, but interface/ ui is horrific. Incredibly irritating and slow. I'd love to spend less time on youtube but their interface flows."
"There used to be a feature on spotify where you could look at an artists profile and click the more button to see all their songs and preview how they sound. Spotify for some reason got rid of that, and now it is way to hard to find new artists songs because you cannot listen to them. Because of this I now find new songs far less frequently and by now I would've just moved to YouTube music but Youtubes app is missing lots of songs and has their own problems. Spotify also has way too many ads."
"Dear Spotify, great interface, nice graphics. I installed to listen to the JRE, I am TRYING to make you my primary rss manager. However, the constant buffering while listening to DOWNLOADED episodes...yes I have the ""audio only while listening"" and any othe setting set right. I'm in a rural area, ut stalls and buffers when my cell service is poor or I go from cell to wifi... my other rss managers don't reqire such heavy background network traffic to play a DOWNLOADED eppisode...WASSUP WIT DAT!?!"
"No video on JRE on Xbox. Its funky i had to reinstall 3 times until it finally worked somewhat decent. They need alot of improvements. Sometimes it loses my place of my podcasts and I spend a lot of time trying to figure out where I left off. Even for offline listening it requires cell connection, why?!."
there has been an inconvenience with the experimental features like the reduced tab and also probably I'd say the unsaved renamed username. Also the unavailability of certain track and songs are quite of a bummer. I hope future updates will present better overhaul and refinement. Thank You.
"I love the app it's fast and quick but for some reason it always keeps logging me off and removing my Downloaded songs, it always does this every single day, Spotify needs to fix this because this an annoying issue for me"
Songs and playlists work great. App is buggy as hell and constantly freezes and then won't be able to play or change song. Is quite frustrating.
"I am enjoying it very greatly, I am impressed with this aap and it has world wide songs Specially my kpop songs I love üíï listening üéß them all the time, I get all my searched songs quickly , But nowadays my Spotify is not opening quickly it is taking time to open only that's the problem I have to say that if your Spotify has any problems then please recover it Thats why I am giving it only three stars Instead of this I am enjoying listening üéß my songs ."
I have tried to replace Acast with Spotify. Still downloaded pods can not be deleted automatically after listening. There are an easy way to put subscribed poss on a heap. You use the built in Episode play list. Awkwardly you can not rearrange the different episode in the list! The Daily Podcast list that is generated has o significance to my listening pattern at all after 5 day. The only advantage I can find with Spotify is that it is available on desktop. For music listening it is excellent.
Love the app but I always have the same hand full of songs come on when I shuffle my music. Kinda ruins the experience and songs hearing them over and over again even with over 1200 liked songs or a 150+ long playlist.
"The songs are definitely great quality yet the amount of ads is just annoying, also adding random songs to a playlist we want with mysic we genuinely want to listen to? What's the point?"
This app claims that it contains great songs ( including retro) but it seems that only new songs are promoted more here. I searched 'bohot pyar krte h ' song which is a very famous song of it's time but the app says 'couldn't find the song'. If anyone is a retro lover then this app is quite frustrating for them.
Love the amount of content and the algorithms used to find what I like but it's annoying to get the offer of 30 mins ad free and I still get ads 80% of the time I click the button
"The ability to stream music endlessly is of course fantastic, however the interface is hot garbage. The player itself needs a major overhaul and would benefit well by having more customization to suit a user's individual tastes. Also, whenever I open the app it takes at least 5 minutes before I can play or search anything while it downloads my library, which seems to be forever stuck at 92%."
the app somehow worked until now but rn the search button does not work I can't play a lot of songs even though I have stable internet and I didn't do anything by changing settings.It just can't play songs anymore :(
I like to appreciate spotify for developing such a convenient app in the music industry. The secret behind the convenience of this app is you can easily switch between devices just by one click . But one of the main criticism about spotify that I want them to listen that please review your ads those ads are quite annoying due to its all about yourself. most of the time when we play playlist it gives a massive ads which destroys the whole mode of that playlist.
"I adore your UX, music quality is the best, AI isn't perfect but still great. The only thing is when I paid you for my subscription I paid not only for music but for podcasts too. So why in nine hells can't I listen podcasts from Ukraine?"
just you know all the time it doesn't really like to work well with the Bluetooth of a car or just the Bluetooth any kind when it comes to like skipping songs and controlling the music and such and then after Android updated to I think it was Android 11 it just decided it was no longer at all going to allow me to control anything other than the play button and the and the volume button through the Bluetooth on my car and I know that it's Spotify because it works with other apps
"It's great for compiling your own playlists and finding artists and everything, but the whole recommendation thing is not good... All daily playlists consist of the same stuff day after day, with like 5 new songs. The same goes for recommendations based on your playlists,even after refreshing the same stuff comes back. Likes/dislikes don't help to filter anything out either, so it's quite annoying sometimes to be hearing the songs you don't like everyday. And I'm using premium version btw..."
Not-quite-polished music streaming service. Needs lots of work on home network integration (Google Home). Service is almost non-existent.
"Great app on premium, but for some reason the pause/play button on my headphones don't work anymore. The lockscreen music player doesn't work anymore either. Please fix."
Great app and it will get five stars from me when it has a search tool inside a podcast playlist besides filter. Some playlist available to follow have over hundred episodes and it become quite difficult to find an episode related to listeners interest. Another improvement would be showing less list or let the listener choose what to see in the mainpage. Thanks.
"Spotify is great, don't get me wrong, but there are too many issues to say it's definitely worth your money. 1) app stops playing music randomly 2) podcast play button doesn't always work 3) zero customer support 4) all my songs aren't appearing in Liked Songs 5) no ""Find In Album"" equivalent for podcasts (very annoying). The last ones more of a suggestion but all in all, Spotify could be a solid product if they'd just fix those annoying bugs . P.S. they asked for a review"
"It's a great app, I used it on the bus to school everyday until I can't turn off the shuffle button so now I can't listen to anything I want. I am also confused because I used to be able to skip songs and now I cannot yet I never bought anything... *confused confusing confusion*"
"Amazing UI. Looks are, of course, 10/10. Only bad thing, and a really bad thing is, you can't play any song you'd like. It shuffles the song, making YouTube significantly better. I get that the creators need money, but it's just pain to find the exact song. Gave 3 stars only because the app is ""easy"" to use. I'll come back if they ever make it so you can play any song. I said ""ever"" so don't expect me here anytime soon. Beats me that people still use spotify instead of deezer."
Quite annoying it doesnt play the songs that are in the playlist and I end up using all my skips. Adds songs to my playlists so it gets a 3 because other than that it's quite good
"""Watch this short ad to get 30 minutes - "" Why is there a no thanks button if I'm going to have to watch 55 ads to listen to 1 song, Also whats up with the Playlist ? I added 10 songs and it only played the ones spot added? Everything else works fine but those are the only things bugging me."
"It's actually good but for too much advertisements after per each one song, that's, it's getting sucked and totally ruining the music the mood, I will say it's ok with advertising but at least give less and don't give everytime per each 1 song, it's really irritating for us who can't pay everytime..."
The app is great for designing playlists and discovering artists but I've been having issues with the app randomly crashing on both of my phones and my laptop.
So the free version is basically unusable having said that I bought the premium version and it's really good I always struggled to find songs I like but the Spotify algorithm helped me expand my song library by more than a double the first 2 days of use the app itself is easy to use and has a clean pleasing design also I love listening to songs in high definition and downloading the payed experience is really good I'd give it a 5 stars but we have to think about free usr just give them skips ffs
"Good app, I have few suggestions though. 1. Same track is allowed to be added multiple times in a playlist. This should be restricted. This was notified in the previous version of windows application but was never available for android apps. Same track from same album, multiple copies of that in same playlist should be a complete NO-NO. 2. There is no option to find what podcasts you follow in mobile app. You should be able to see the podcast button on the same activity where it shows, artists, albums and songs. I think the 1st point is extremely important and I would like to know what your developer team thinks about this. Thanks"
"Spotify is a great app for music but nothing can be that good can it. Ok so, you can create tonnes of playlists and put whatever songs you want in those playlists but there was a new update and now your playlist is automatically shuffled. You can edit them how you would like but you can't select an individual song to be played from that playlist so you just have to hit the play button and see what song you get. The only way you can change this is getting premium and premium is $12.00 a month."
I would've given 5 stars but there are some problems here. There is no way to know how many times a song has been played other than the top 5 on artist's page. There is lack of information about the song like the artists involved in writing and producing the music and there is no translation of lyrics for other language songs. I hope you introduce these things real quick because it would be much more convenient if we don't have to google everything.
It's good but some features are definitely needed. I usually listen to Japanese podcasts and songs but still I cannot choose to like Japanese songs by language. Since the availablity to play exists so should the search and recommendations. More general YouTube Hindi playlist need to be added. We always need to search each song Individually. Taking another star off for that black circle on logo. Destroys my material design look.
The service is very good. But a few unsolved bugs ruin the experience. For instance i have to redownload some of the songs i had already downloaded again and again. There are problems during playback. I am a paid subcriber and think that the app looks overall good and clean but the bugs are a major problem.
"Needs Major UX Help... Lots of problems when playing with multiple devices. Most times I'm in my car I'm skipping songs to find out my Echo dots at home are playing. Have to fiddle with ""Play on this Device"". Why can't I follow a playlist without having to search for it by name. My partner starts a random playlist on echo dot and it's a pain to follow the current playlist. You have to go to your device and see what's playing, then search for it by name. Why can't you just tap to follow. ü§∑"
"Please add a button ""do not repeat a track for 1 month"" I am really pissed off of listening to the same songs!! Also add a ""avoid music gender"" to not suggest/play reggaeton for example. Additionally, even though I downloaded albums, it still consumes lots of data."
Has gotten worse over time. Not better. Update: Still not great. They don't want to improve because they have a monopoly. It's definitely good at tracking. But the user experience is utter trash.
Good app. The developers can make it better. I rated this 3 stars because- A) It shows so many ads in between each being of at least 20 sec. Why so many long ads? B) It doesn't allow me to add almost every song in my playlist. I keep on clicking the add song button but it is useless. Please make this app better
Please add seperate category for songs and podcasts I cannot find songs in home as I listen more on podcasts.But when I wanted to listen songs the home is fully filled with podcast suggestions.Please improve UI in mobile and pc as it is very very slow and feels like a graphic intensive game loading
"Quite good but... This is a great service. However it lacks simple options that would make it awesome. For instance it could do with more filtering and organising options, most importantly organise and group artists under custome tags or folders. Not difficult to add this option I am sure"
Well at first it was amazing but later it started causing problems like they play different songs instead of the one i click i tried all possible ways to fux it but no its not working at lot i can't listen my own music nd m relaly dissatisfied Plzz i request plz fix my problem I Don't want to delete Spotify its an really amazing app but its not working plzz fix it
"I love this app but the spotify wrapped 2020 is not working for me. I try to tap it and it opens these stories but its just all black with a refresh button in the middle. When i press that or don't, the app closes and opens itself up again. I've tried everything, updating the app, uninstalling and installing again (twice) and opening and closing the app multiple times but nothing works."
"Super edge case here but should be trivial to fix. Crashes when I try to enter wrapped from front page. I have animations in Android disabled so the error below makes sense, if you haven't accounted for the null value. Doesn't crash with animations turned on. Please keep in mind some of us hate animations in UI with a passion :) java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot set 'scaleX' to Float.NaN"
"Still quite a few glitches that needs to be addressed, but the variety of songs are great, i personally love the 60's 70's and 80's music that takes me down memory lane."
"Hi! This app has worked quite well so far and I was very happy with it, however now it blocks quite often. The music keeps playing but the name of the song and picture that show on the screen doesn't match. Is like it gets stuck on an old song. And then at some point it crashes! Please fix"
I have been a Spotify Premium user for many years; for the most part it has been a wonderful experience. I find that adding the Podcast division has tanked my user experience. Many functions such as opening up my list of artists or podcast take minutes. Even after going throughout there recommended steps to improve speed.( This included downloaded music ) I have removed most podcasts and started using another app for when Spotify is un usable.
"Sort button for podcasts doesn't work at all, super annoying if you want to listen to a podcast from the beginning that has been running a few years already..."
"(Prime version user) Nice app overall, but the UI/UX could be much better (not enough place here for all my remarks), as well as the recommendations algorithm (take e.g. Last.FM's one). Also, since last two updates the app doesn't turn to landscape mode, which is really bothering in a car. On off.site, they say they're aware of the issue, since a month or so. Please fix asap."
normally this app is really good but I go to shuffle my playlists and it skips song after song after song so quick and im not touching my phone its glitching or something and its making me frustrated.
The working is best. Something where I reduced stars are the UI. The interface is not that much impressive. Kindly work on the app UI animations.
I love my premium spotify to hell and back but there is some bug and while my phone is connected to the internet my spotify just disconnects and I can't stream songs that aren't downloaded. Its quite frustrating.
"It is quite good but sometimes the add is just too much for a non- premium like it appears every 6 songs or some sort, also I already bought premium with the account I'm using right now but after 14 days it said that my premium is already finished eventho I bought the family premium and lasts more than a month, so I'm quite confused on how and why it's happening pls fix this, because I have to buy premium again eventho I already did"
"Is anyone else having issues with the app, or just me? It freezes on a song title while the music still playing, the only way to stop/pause the song is by clicking that button 3 times...why Spotify???"
I love spotify as an app but this app is a mess man if you have any apps open in the background it crashes you download songs and press the power button to put your phone in sleep mode it crashes you open a app with spotify in the background it crashes sometime it just crashes randomly without reason its just a pain man pls fix
Could be great if it had landscape mode. They added a button in car mode without resizing the others so now it just looks sloppy.
"I like the app except they put songs in I didn't choose. I'm not paying 9.99 a month for premium. I'll listen to the ads, just quit putting songs in I did not choose."
"Usually this would be 5 star but after latest upgrade the app keeps crashing and complaining about permissions when all have been given. In fact, I have had to enable permissions previously turned off, which the app worked perfectly before and didn't require, and still is flakey. It makes no sense... there are some bugs that need investigating and areas need refactored ASAP before I have to start testing out Prime Music."
"I love Spotify, even the limited free version. However, lately this app has been very laggy and buggy. Often the app simply tells me I am offline when I know for a fact that I am not offline. Not even restarting the app more than five times helps, it only sometimes helps to restart my device. It is very frustrating, especially since my device warns me that Spotify is continuing to use a lot of my data even when I am supposedly offline. Please look into this issue."
Music keeps stopping when casting to Yamaha Musiccast. On the Musiccast so it still shows playing. But on Spotify of shows stopped and the play button needs to be tapped again.
"This app is great for music listeners...... Just few problems...... There are a lot of ads in the free version which makes the app quite annoying after a while to use...... More than two ads start playing after every 3 songs........ And after the last update, the lyric viewer is not functioning properly...... Its alright in the mini version ( below the song's poster ). But when you tap on it to open, it crashes and continues showing lyrics in the mini view........ Please fix this problem ASAP..."
"There are some serious issues with this service that the community have been requesting fixes for for over half a decade, but they don't care. They know you'll keep paying because no other service really compares. Useful features are removed more often than added, and the UI on Android is a confusing illogical nightmare."
"Surprisingly buggy for such a mature app. Play controls disappear from lock screen on my S20+ . ""Currently playing"" track information is showing a song I listened to yesterday-- not what's currently playing. Refuses to update unless I restart phone. Play/pause controls for ""currently playing"" track quit working at some point every day."
Great way to play music and probably the best for free but the fact that they say you get 30 minutes free of adds after watching 2 adds and then not even 17 minutes later they show another add ruins it and makes you want to listen somewhere else.
"The app indeed is good, gives a lot of options according to the mood, but the number of ads in between kills all the mood. For example, if you're sad and listening to the sad mood playlist and then ads play back to back, the mood is spoiled which in the end makes you quit the app. Currently the number of ads is 3-4 back to back."
"Great range of music.Really annoying interface. There are so many well established, well designed media players in existence that could be used as examples."
"It would be really cool new feature if you could create folders / categories of Artists. Its hard to remember every Artist you like, but if you were able to create a folder eg, ""Pop"" or ""Festival 2021"" and add your favourite artists it would be a quick and easy directory. This especially makes sense for artists who no longer make music, they dont have new releases so you've no way to remember them. Otherwise, I love the app."
"The streaming service and UI are good, but the performance is abysmal at times. Even connected to fast Wifi, LTE, or even 5G with a strong connection sometimes the app will act like there's not connection available when other streaming apps like YT or Soundcloud have no trouble at all."
"I actually prefer the old feature, in which with free account you can click on the artist's album and play their tracks, even if it's just a 30 seconds preview. this new update is quite inconvenient and difficult not just to that, but to actually add my favourite songs into my playlist and I have to do that with spotify web player, or connect my phone with it. if there's an upgrade where everyone can do that, we would be very appreciated. and also, let us reorder the tracks. thank you."
"This app is so good!!! But!! I dont know but when i open my spotify it always crashing and it quickly forced to stopped, my only solution is to reinstall this app. Please fix this kind of issue."
What the hell spotify why did you change it? I was able to skip the music & i was able to listen to that song that i wanted but now its ruined i wanted to listen walkin by mary mary but a different music started to play and i cant skip the music why did you change it? The old version was way better i'm giving you 3 stars
"I've been using Spotify premium for more than 2 years now. And it's quite upsetting that due to the updates, musuc just suddenly stops in the middle of the songs I'm playing. Double checked everything including the settings of my phone, but found nothing."
"Kannada songs has a best music, I couldn't find Kannada songs genre in search tab quite UNSATISFIED. HOPING community will look after to FIX IT on next update. apart from that one of the best Music streaming app with Stunning sound quality"
"Still can take a while to load pages but improved so useable. However, the notification screen to quickly play and pause on lock screen or pull down menu disappears very quickly when on pause, can this please be fixed and always stay unless user chooses to close it? It's annoying having to open app just to press play"
"the app is great, but the recent update messed it up. earlier there used to be a hide button right on songs, which is now absent."
The app seems to be quite satisfied but I m really missing the sleep option which is available on other apps .I feel adding this would be a better inclusion. The song suggestion are not bad but need to give more playlists
"In the last two months I've been having an issue when connecting Bluetooth devices to my phone (Samsung galaxy s20 ultra, but only with Spotify). The play now screen freezes on one song. Even if I play different songs it will always say it's playing that one song. Quitting the app doesn't fix it. This issue only goes away after I restart my phone. Also when it's connected to my car audio and I turn the car off. Spotify keeps playing and will not stop playing until I quit the app."
"Things I don't like: - there is no play button in artist/album pictures - there is no play all button in the artist page only a shuffle (yes I have premium) - podcasts auto play next, and not even from oldest to newest. Things I like: - dark theme - doesn't seem laggy - colour effects and animations Pet peeve: - trying to play music on one device while controlling it with another device doesn't work how I would like it since it just switches to the second device for playback"
"Well organised, good and simple UI but unfortunately very unstable, it goes offline quite often so it needs restarting , even other apps like YouTube have connection. Please improve performance so it works well on midrange phones as well."
"I accidentally hit the ""no background data use button"". Now that I've turned it back on, Spotify keeps alerting me that background app use is off, even though I turned it back on. And my stuff keeps pausing constantly. I'm not sure what to do about that."
"Moved from Google Music, a lot of interface elements feel really awkward. One of the most annoying is the three-dots menu, which is terribly slow to open, while on GM it opened instantly. Another issue is playlist editing, a swipe to remove a track would be much better than ticking it and pressing 'remove'. Lastly, some elements seem to look wrong, like play-pause button is a plain white circle, no triangle sign for play; track progress bar is also hardly visible. Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Android 10."
"I love spotify and it has all the best songs, but when I try to add songs to my playlist that I searched up the add button doesnt work? Maybe it's my phone but I do think it is the app please fix it"
It's decent for the most part except for the fact that I can't manually choose a song or playlist. The ads can very easily ruin the flow of everything..
I love this app but sometimes the music doesn't play( when tap the play button). And can't find my recently played music which is a big problem because I always have too search it again and again.
I love this app but I have a suggestion for a update. Could you please make a button that lets you move songs from one playlist to a different playlist. Thank you
"I used to love this app, but oh my gosh one of the updates ruined it. Now replaying, choosing, or skipping songs more than 6 times is premium only. It's ridiculous."
"I really love Spotify, the selection of music is exceptional and quality is great. My problem is that it is very glitchy, it closes randomly for no reason quite a bit."
"I love spotify and have been using it for a while now, but have been facing some problems for quite sometime now, the most annoying and the irritating bit is that the songs downloaded on the app, keep re-downloading every day. That's a pain because when I want songs to be available offline they aren't. Looking up for some help here!"
"The app has work perfectly fine up until just a few weeks ago than it logged me out of my account when I closed the app and when I went to log back in a few hours later it said that is was offline even thou I had my mobile data on and my wifi, any other app requiring either of these things were working perfectly fine. Please fix this I listened to my music almost everyday while I was cleaning and now I can't."
"Love Spotify, especially for the playlists that it makes specifically for you...but recently it's been telling me that I'm offline, and not letting me browse any music. Update: there was no help to fix this, also lately songs will just stop randomly. Or there will be a song playing but the picture is from a different song and the bar doesn't move/ the play and pause button are stuck. I am considering changing music platforms"
"There should be more filters and better recommendations. Also a ""My mix"" option would be nice like the one from YouTube. The app seems to be designed so you spend more time looking up for new songs and less time actually playing a song. Is sad to say that YouTube music is gonna kill Spotify with its recommendations algorithms. Maybe you should team up with music map (website) to find a way to build a music taste profile of your customer. There is a lot of work to do, programmers... wake up!"
"I really love listening to music on this app and being able to make Playlist. Its also amazing at find new music I genuinely like. However there security is the worse, my account gets hacked every few months. And when you change the password and have all accounts signed out you'll get notifications that a device has logged in and it will only tell you what country the devices is in, sometimes making it hard to know if its from when you just resigned in or a hacker piggy backing off your account"
"Been using spotify for 4 years. Never had issues until recently. Constant crashes and sometimes only my downloaded songs are able to be played or what I have cached. Also, this new UI is pretty bad especially for your Now Playing. Great application on PC but mediocre on Mobile."
"This is a good app no doubt. The only thing that sucks is the UI. Specifically, the mismatched status bar. I would really love it if the status bar was properly transparent or at least if the app supported full-screen."
"I'd enjoy it more if I had the option to prevent certain artists from appearing on any of my recommended playlists or time capsules. I dont listen to Drake, yet that mf is on every recommendation/discovery weekly/time capsule playlist I have. I am quite positive I DO NOT wanna listen to Drake, or any other rapper that I've never heard of. So please, let me select who's music is NOT** allowed to appear on any of my personalized playlists, then spotify would be bangin'"
"Have been a premium member for almost a year now. Love the app, UI. The playlists are amazing, I can totally connect it on any of my devices. I love how they don't spam with constant notifications and reminders. The streaming quality is great. But of late, the app has started crashing quite often. Hope they fix it soon enough for me to not shop for another provider in the market. Most of the bollywood songs are still not available on the app."
"Needs fixed! Without premium, it says ""press this button and watch this ad for 30 min of ad free music"" so I watch the ad, but I still get more ads within the 30 minutes! I don't mind watching an ad every so often, but do what you say you'll do!"
"It's a decent app. The only problem with this app is that whenever I'm not using Spotify, a random song on my playlist starts to play for absolutely no reason. I didn't mind it at first, but it started to repeat multiple times a day, including when I was sleeping at night, disturbing my sleep. I am certain with the fact that I don't want to wake up every single night having to wake up and pause it, and it got very annoying pretty quickly. I hope you can fix this issue soon."
"Recent updates has made it quite bugy. The album cover and song name freezes, and when that happens the song timer doesn't stop when the freezed song should, the time will eventually go way higher than it should be. First i tried to close the app regularly, it didn't work, then i restarted my phone (OnePlus 7T Pro), it did not work, finally i tried reinstalling the app and it worked. This is a very annoying issue, because i have to install all my saved songs again. This has happened many times."
"The service it provides is great and I recommend premium but by god one of the most annoying things is when I queue a bunch of songs in the Whats Next queue, tab out of the app to connecf my blue tooth speaker, and when I go back, the queue is gone. If I reset to the beginning of a half played song, it goes back to where it was before I changed it... Eithet fix your goddamn app or give me a save button to make sure what I do is actually REMEMBERED! It happens like 90% of the time."
I don't mind an ad here and there but now they're showing upto 3 ads inbetween one or two songs. It constantly ruins the experience.
"just trying to add to reports of the buginess since sept. update, especially noticed in the past week - have to force quit to unfreeze screen, and it loses track of what im listening to ( the play screen and play bar both get stuck on a song at some point) imagined yall are on it but thus one is pretty annoying tbh lol"
It's going struggle lately. It gets stuck so much when was playing a song and change to another then the ui never updates and even more when trading to synchronize with the car.
"Same issues plaguing me as many of the other users here are reporting. Frequent crashing, incorrect song being shown (as opposed to what's playing), Spotify occasionally pausing when the screen auto-offs as well as the same song being 'frozen' to the bottom of my screen."
The same problem with others. The songs stops playing randomly quite often. The played song doesn't show in the preview.
I would rate higher but i wont. When im playing my liked playlist i listen to 1 song and like 7 ads start playing. I really hate it. And i cant get premium. And when im listening to my big liked playlist a random song comes up and i hate it. Please change this. Its ruining my experience.
"I love Spotify and have been using Premium since 2017, but lately, the app has been having issues. Artists won't load, if I change songs, the song tray won't update to my new song, sometimes the play button doesn't work. Hopefully this gets fixed soon."
App has been bugging for several days (since the last update). Pause button won't work and even though I'm listening to a certain song it'll show another one. Been a great fan of Spotify for a long time and would normally give 5 stars but this issue makes it hard to listen to music normally.
"I like Spotify Premium. However, when I try to play the play and pause button either won't work or will not stop playing the music."
Amazon Music has improved drastically with Lyrics for most songs. It doesn't make sense to pay for Spotify and Musixmatch both to get the same experience only for a slightly better UI.
"Lots of bugs, I can't tell you how much the experience is ruined by these bugs, sometimes an ad pops up and even after pressing close it just doesn't go away, I get stuck in one playlist at times and the song just sometimes never plays even though it shows that I'm 10 seconds into the song, please fix this soon"
"having a few issues, music continues to play when I use other apps (IE YouTube) doesn't stop when I power off my headphones. App doesn't update to current song playing but seemingly the song I chose upon starting the app up, when I skip to the next track it isn't displaying the correct song. Doesn't show up in my notification tab as per usual. Play button doesn't work in app when a song is playing and have to manually close app to stop music playing. On Android 11 with pixel 4"
"Most annoying thing is the offline listening - instead of showing you only what is playable it shows all your songs, artist and so on - go figure what you've downloaded or not.. surprisingly lame ! No built in equaliser with preferably profiles for each device you're using - I'm using regularly three different devices, each one is very different, in two of them it sounds decent but on the third one it sound awful and needs third party equaliser so on my phone it's easy but on my computer not.."
"I use Spotify on a daily basis, but in the last 2 days the screen that shows what song I'm listening to seems to constantly freezes (including track length), even though the music continues to play (Listening to A, and seeing B as the song I'm listening to) . I can't see what song is currently playing. I'm still able to press the pause, skip, and restart button, but It's getting annoying to have to stop and reset the app every time this happens."
"It's a nice app, okay... but when it updated I am slowly starting to hate it... whenever I go to my playlist, my only option is to push the play button so I could play the whole song on my playlist, I can't pick the song I wanted to listen to at that moment, I dont know if it's just me being dumb not knowing how it functions or is it really the app..."
This app used to work fine on my Pixel 3a then all of a sudden the last 30 days errors galore!! songs play out of nowhere control buttons missing from the screen.. songs playing but can't pause them because the control buttons are missing just a mess please fix or I'm going to tidal this is ridiculous
"This app is really good. But recently, I've been experiencing a horrible bug where the song gets stuck and it ruins the entire lineup. Please fix soon"
"It's fidgety with having multiple of the same song liked, not updating what song is playing in the UI until after I restart the app and another BIG one is that though they haven't outright banned Joe Rogan, not all of his videos are on the platform."
"I really love music but my google Mini needs a buddy like Spotify (genarally I love Amazon music).. but when I try to add some music to playlist the plus button doesn't even work and I don't know why I need to go to the album and then click the add button and sometimes I don't even know which album it is,, how can I add it to my playlist? please fix it dear Spotify üôè"
Loving the suggestions and the ease of interface. Not loving glitches like suddenly stopping playback every 60 seconds and requiring me to hit play when using bluetooth headphones. When I'm trying to run that gets tired real quick. Tried uninstall-reinstall and logging out on all devices. No joy.
"Not sure if it is just my phone but with this latest update, the spotify app opens slowly to a black screen and sometimes nothing loads at all. I have a Samsung Galaxy S9+ on Android 10 One UI 2.1"
If I want to listen to a song I like without premium it doesn't let me. Which is quite annoying. I have to listen to songs I don't want to listen all the time. At least let us pick songs we want to listen to in our like songs. Without any premium.
"Getting a black screen and app hang (leading to force closure) when rotating device from portrait to landscape whilst on an album track listing, running Android 11 on a pixel4 XL ... Only started happening on the latest build , very strange"
Its fine. Just missing some basic features. A button to delete all your downloaded songs would be great. I had to uninstall and install again just to clear the data.
"I like the app but the only downfall about it nowadays is that, lets say I made a playlist and add about 5 songs. Spotify would add 25 random songs and it would take me 20 minutes to listen to my 1 song, (Without skipping 5 times). Honestly now it is so more complicated and stuff because I just had my playlist and it was way more simple. I dont know if I had free spotify premium somehow but I am quite sad that it doesnt work like that anymore (P.s. It might be a reason because I used the album)."
"Quite often when I select a song or if the song changes, my phone locks or just completely freezes my phone. Otherwise good app."
Too many ads. Which is kind of counterintuitive because almost all the ads want you to buy the in app premium. Otherwise it's the best app for music streaming
"everything is cool except when i click on an artist/profile on my laptop it always says ""Something went wrong. Have another go?"" and there's a button that says ""try again"". i click on it and nothing happens. kinda annoying :/"
"its good, hate the shuffle play but hey, they need things for primium. but what i dont like is that when i build my playlist it plays things that have nothing to do with my playlist and that dont exist there. please stop that, and to add to it, latetly it ""jumps"" from my playlist to a different playlist that I can't find. Please fix that. Also, please stop sticking 5-6 ads everytime and together! 1 or 2 are enough!"
"I am a US serviceman, and have recently moved to the UK. Now, I can listen to The Joe Rogan experience....solely because of the video broadcast it appears. I can ""listen"" to all my other podcasts...please give me a ""listen only "" option for the Podcast farm you are building, that will eventually become a paywall that limits simple access."
"I've just transferred from YT music. Takes a while to get used to the difference but it's easy enough to use. One feature that requires some serious attention is the ability to clear an entire queue, not just single songs as this has made setting up play lists and trialing whether songs flow together correctly an absolute pain."
It's a great app for music lovers and I really appreciate the very comfy UI of the app but the glitches in loading songs and playlists is something which even an unpaid listener don't want . This is area where you need to improve your app . I was thinking to buy the premium membership of the app but these things just resist me from buying it.
"It is a really great app. But whenever I listen to songs while working on another app it closes many times, it is quite annoying. And could you please make the skip songs feature useable whenever you want, and not only for premium?"
"Better experience with it when I was using an ios One: Why did the search for a song button in liked songs disappear? Two: I cannot access the menu per song when I'm offline, why is that? Three: in the ios version, i could just swipe to add a song to queue, here, I have to click per song and then wait for the menu to appear. It can get tedious. And again, I cannot access the queue feature when I'm offline because it keeps asking me to go online."
"Great choice of music but I do find it to be quite a glitch app, also does not give the 30 mins uninterrupted listening it claims between ads."
Ok so you know it's good but I have some complaints. I thought the ads were supposed to be half an hour apart but they're a lot more frequent. Also I have an issue with skipping songs. There should be an option to go back to a song. The amount of times I've accidentally swiped to the next song by accident is quite frustrating
"The music quality and the variety of songs available is good , although there is one problem sometimes even when the mobile internet is on the app shows that it is offline. Have to close the app multiple times or put the phone in airplane mode in order to resolve this issue and it is quite frustrating a lot of times. Please fix it ASAP."
"I really like Spotify as a service, it's miles ahead all of its competitors but the app just became absolutely unusable since like a few months ago. There's bugs everywhere and rn the app will just quit randomly"
"Great app! It allows you to listen to new songs. But the real pain in the neck is the heavy ads, it's like 1 minute of ads for every ten minutes of music. It's crazily annoying! There are apps like NHAC CUA TUI, ZING...which do not interupt customers with such frequent ads. Do not recommend this if you are ads hater!"
"Good music variety, lots of bugs with smart watch(galaxy) app. The ui for the phone app would occasionally freeze and I could only fix this through force stopping the app, closing did not. Good when it works, frustrating when it doesn't. Hope they make some updates to the app especially when connected to watch."
"i have been using Spotify for almost an year now and i loved it, but since a week, i don't know why while playing songs, they aren't audible at all and on screen it shows the song is playing. I tried uninstalling and installing the app again, but the glitch is still there. please take care of this, it's very disturbing while studying and walking and ruins the mood :("
I love your playlist ai! But it would be so damm awesome if the app has Apple music library kind of ui! Like big thumbnails for the downloaded library instead of that list view!
"I just downloaded Spotify 5 minuites ago and I ran into some problems. first, if I press on the 3 small dots next to a song in a playlist it doesn't work. second, when it doesn't work it shuts off the app completely. And third, it randomly shuts off. I do believe Spotify is a great app but these problems prevent my enjoyment. Please fix it."
Its a great app and all but for some reason on my phone the main playlist of liked songs takes ages to load up sometimes so I just quit using that one all together and I really wish I didn't because I got some great songs on there
"Glitchy with my setup. Lg stylo 6, galaxy active watch, jbl clip 3. Music stops about every 10 minutes. Requiring me to unlock phone and play music constantly. App is excluded from power save settings. Songs are downloaded and offline. Spotify connections seems to be the trigger for this occurence."
One ad's okay two is fine but three to four back to back ads damn that's insane. It ruins a listeners mood. I'm also adding another generous note please change the audio quality of the ads they just bang our ears
Hindi playlist not upto the mark. Can't find few songs here. UI is great. Sound quality great. Make playlists better Some technical issues I have faced related to my downloaded songs
"I love the app, but I am just wondering why the preview images are almost nothing but Michelle Obama. I truly don't care much for politics, but for a service that is built on having a massive level of variety, it does seem strange to have 5 of 8 preview images showing the same podcast."
"popular and nice but it has usability issues. i had to learn the navigation - it was not intuitive. Placeholder description in Google play ""Whats new"". currently played song freezes the displayed progress info while the song is playing with latest update"
"Please bring back the dislike / hide button to the song list, rather than having to tap on the three dots and then dislike / hide. Update : 28/08/2020 - An update (after my above post) had the unlike button returned to the song list (which was great), but now another update has removed it again. Why make app functionality worse with each update?! I don't understand."
"Premium premium premium premium premium premium premium premium This is all you need to match the app to its description. Ads are shoved in your face and limited skips? I mean, what the heck? The ads are also too much. But must admit, that the sound quality and UI is pretty good even in the free version."
"Although I love the experience of Spotify as an app, I fundamentally disagree with their model of paying artists. Musicians deserve more income per stream, if they're truly going to embrace streaming as an alternative to physical hard copies. I've seen numerous artists remove select albums from Spotify's catalog, due to there not being enough revenue from their streams. They should be paid fairly for their contributions to the platform, and seeing music go missing ruins the Premium experience."
Great user experience. It would be more helpful if we could queue the song from the search result without actually finding it in a playlist
"I can't seem to find my song podcasts which I followed and downloaded and it only appears when I make the app go offline and when I do I have them but can't play them cause they waiting to download, I have Spotify premium so there's no issue with that, the only issue I can't find my playlists of podcasts when I'm online and when I'm offline I have them but can't play them, pls fix ths issue and quick, it's a great app but ths bug might be problematic and potentially the fall of the end ofSpotify"
"ive been using spotify for a few years now. its alright but the free version is so dumb and restricted! it says you get an ad every 30 mins and they used to actually do that but now they put an ad after ever 2-3 songs and its horrible! the ads are obnoxious and repetitive, it would be better if there was a button where you could just block certain ads or press a button which gives you a different ad. i was sleeping to a playlist and suddenly an ad with a loud song screamed in my ear. this sucks!"
"Simple and straight up music streaming app. Does its job pretty well. I wish they have a working, useful and intuitive equalizer being this app is for audiophiles like myself."
"Hi, i am premium user and when I want to download song, it says ""go to setting to download using cellular"" the thing is I arleady push allowed button to download using my data but still can't download. I tried unisntall then reinstall back, but it's still the same. Now all my downloaded songs gone, thank god the playlist is still there"
"All i can say this app saved me from gaana bhakwas app....i was a long time gaana user bt have to quit it bcoz of too many ads, new introduced short videos, cant play every song. Spotify have huge amount of songs with d sound quality is much better...i loved it..!!! Hope it stays like this"
"Its a great app for music and podcasts but honestly the adds on the free version are just super annoying especially when you get 4 in a row and 2 of them are the same add every time and another thing is when you're driving and it says to click the add to get 30 min of uninterrupted listening is kind of dangerous when you have to unlock your phone and look down to click the button in time, maybe less adds and id rate 5 stars."
"Great features, bad user experience. Menus, views often fail to load or take forever because the app apparently can't connect to Spotify servers."
"I genuinely hate it since the new update, the interface is too edgy and boxy but that's personal preference However, the new update has too many bugs: in lockscreen, the artwork resolution drops Music suddenly stops even though my internet connection is way decent For some reason all my liked songs dissapeared, I had to clear data and log-in again but it's not something that's supposed to happen I don't have any complains except for a few bugs so I hope they'll be fixed soon"
I don't know what is wrong but everytime i want to use the search button it just says something is wrong and that i don't have internet connection. I have good connection and i am able to play the songs in my playlist . Please fix this soon.
"a lot of things are great about the app (artist pay is a different discussion), but i will never understand why the app struggles to play albums i downloaded on the highest quality, if my connection is bad. this is not an issue when im offline/my connection is good, so i think the app tries to play the online version of the song. please fix this, downloaded albums shouldnt require good connection."
Super place to get music. The only thing I hate is that you got rid of the play button in the genre section. I like to listen to everything not just a section please put that back
"Spotify is your best bet for music on Android. I like the general design as it's really helpful however, I find that they hide a lot of features behind Spotify premium which is a shame as otherwise I would always have it on my phone. The worst bit though is that it adds music to your playlist unless you have the premium subscription. EG if you added Jurassic park theme as the only song in your playlist, it would suddenly add another song which you don't want to listen to. That's Crappy!"
"I used spotify for quite a while and up until now it started being a little funky. Whenever I start a song it sounds like a jet engine, but on every other song it sounds perfectly fine."
"Poor app, unintuitive. Option to pick from playlists, artists and albums but not songs in library is very frustrating. Previous version of app had a better ui."
The app is fine but the most recent version is awful because the setup of the main screen is ruined. Basically what I mean is that the whole song skipping or pausing let's move to the side and I find this awful. I would ask in the next update we can have an option between besides setup and the bottom set up.
By mistake i deleted my last review while trying to edit that.. So its 2 years i am using Spotify my last issue was a lot of songs were not available in my region and it took almost 1.5 years to resolve that Matter so i change from 1 to 3 star. My other issues is the daily recommendations are too repetitive.. Just change the songs the artists and recomend some songs which i have not heard bt might suit my style of songs.. But to enjoy to the fullest u need premium membership..
"Why can't the interface be intuitive like other good apps. For example : Long press to reorder playlist, swipe left or right on a song to add/remove to playlist Only good thing I find about the app is Spotify connect. PS: I am a premium user. Google Play music was so much better."
Couple of things there needs to be a beta option...and the system ui needs a adjustment...I want to be able to block certain artist on any radio channel. In addition arrange my home with what I'm interested in.
"This app experience is all focused on online experience and the playlist made by the app. For someone who likes to listen to full albums is almost as a quest, as it is hard to avoid the shuffle buttons shoved in your face and hard to find the downloaded content."
"Having so many issues since the latest update. Songs won't play at all at least 25% of the time, album artwork isn't showing in the car, having real continuity issues when moving from device to device (phone to Mac to car for example)."
This music app is quite good. Easy accessible and good song quality. But all songs aren't available here and ads are very frequent which are the major drawbacks about this app . So I'm giving 3‚≠ê
"Paid membership. Good for listening to all the music you like but the app itself feels so outdated. Can't change pictures of custom playlists, cluttered layouts in artist or album pages, no option to rearrange your saved playlists into an order that suits you. The picture thing annoys me the most though."
Well these days I found that it was alittle hard to use Spotify. When I wanted to search for a song I like I couldn't . I am not that sure in how to discribe my issue but when I press the search button it would immediately kicked me out. But overoll Spotify is really nice just that sometimes there will be promotions which are slightly annoying . But u recommend you all to use Spotify to listen to your music
"With VPN turned on, it crashes quite often. Sometimes the changing of songs is slow, other times doesn't play songs at all."
"It was okay when I had the free version as it's quite annoying most of the time, but as soon as I used the free trial I couldn't stop using it. Unfortunately my trial has now ended and im still trying to work out how to cancel it"
Overall it's a great app for music lovers but one thing that's annoys me is that it's ads..like it's just ruins the mood so I hope they can fix this...but it's worth downloading
"I like this app but there are quite a few flaws, like the fact I actually have to pay to be able to do curtain things however I still recommend it since at least it acts like yt and let's U listen to playlists similar and relative to the artists you'd usually listen to so 3 stars is very fitting for me"
"Do not hide tracks, UI does not allow reverting or undoing it in some cases. In more cases if you're not paying. If tracks are hidden accidentally, support is sorry (and can't help)"
"The real big thing that stops me switching from YouTube Music, is that Spotify doesn't have any proper swipes, one hand gestures to control the app. It's frustrates me when I try to close or open the player. It definitely needs some big UX adjustments in order to appeal to more users, especially with the modern big screens on phones."
People uae this app during their drives all the time. It may turn into a life threatening situation if people cant change the song from their lock screen. This may require a new update(?)
"It keeps making me tap the play button because it only plays half a second spurts of song and I have to tap it 5 times in a row (or more) for it to actually play continuously, except I'm on premium and dont remember my account so I don't want to uninstall the application"
"Love the app. I've been on it for years now. Recently however, there was an update that looked nicer and felt nicer to use, but it was quickly undone for some reason after I restarted my phone. I don't know if it was just released by mistake, but if not I would like it back lol."
It's a great app great layout and everything but it wont let me listen to the songs on a playlist in the right order and the turn off shuffle button does not appear
It sure is a very good and efficient app but the thing that bugs me is that I really don't want the premium membership but they always pop it up and that causes my phone to hang and my screen freezes quite often......
"Not loving the floating-squares-in-the-void interface or the lack of a normal play button on playlists (Shuffle play is it, huh?) Nor the fact that ""new releases"" is inexplicably buried in the search menu instead on the home screen where it belongs. Too much emphasis on podcasts and random curated lists (who wants that?) WinAmp had a better interface and library setup in the 1990s."
"Great streaming service, cheap subscription and ginormous library. But the app is mediocre. The UI is pretty bad and inability to play local files sucks. Needs huge improvement."
Since updated two days ago. It kept stop and quit from the apps while in the middle of playing the music. Please help to fix it and lemme experience the premium Spotify I alrdy paid for
"23 minutes to load and work properly today. Even for spotify, that is a long time. What is the point of paying for ""premium"" for that, and when it becomes worse over time? Please fire whatever you have creating the updates for a better listening experience. Please, please, please, just. make. it. play. music. when. the. button. is. pressed. Used to be 5 stars."
This app isn't that quite responsive every time I want to skip or play it from the begining it just play in the middle of the song. Kinda annoying every time I want to play my own play list I couldn't start from the 1st song in my list. But this app still good so I gave 3star if the skip button will be fix I will change my rating.
For some reason Spotify loves to change the UI to make it worse. The app is basically unusable. In addition there is no way to actually provide feedback through email. The app gets worse by the day. Bring back the queue button!
"Have been using Spotify premium for quite a while now and haven't really had any problems. However, I have 105 'Liked Songs' but when I turn Spotify to offline mode, or lose internet connection, the 105 songs which had been downloaded became only 3. This means that I can only play 3 songs from the 'Liked Songs' playlist when I'm without internet connection. Used to be able to play all the song in that playlist with or without internet connection. Please fix this, thank you!"
"Spotify is good but there are some problems that need fixed. First the shuffle is bad there's no way to turn it off. Next Spotify advertises that you can make your own playlists but Spotify adds songs to your playlist complete ruining your playlist. Last sometimes you want to listen to a particular song fast, and it gives you a pop-up asking if you want listen to an ad for 30 min of unerupted listening if you select no thanks it gives you an ad anyways and you don't get 30 min devs plz fix üôè"
The music suggestions don't work from time to time. If I select a song and click the next button the same song keeps playing. I find this bug only on my mobile device.
"I used to really love this app. After this most recent update, however, I noticed that I can't view an artist's album tracks or individual songs. This was frustrating enough to get me to quit using Spotify altogether."
Multiple device sync is handled quite well! 21/07/2020 At least that's what I thought up until recently! Switching from devices has become a headache. I am not able to see where I left of a song or podcast when I switch to some other device.
"I'm quite disappointed with this app, before purchasing the premium it showed that it's audio quality will increase upto 3x with high quality type streaming but after purchasing its quite same as before..üòìüòì plz fix it.."
"My Spotify experience has been great. But I can not say the same about the Spotify application. Putting it short, the app is unresponsive, refuses to take simple commands like play pause and then a few minutes later performs all commands all at onces. The people at Spotify have assisted me, they given me a fresh account. I will update this review. Update: 19 JUL 2020 The major problems I had have been resolved but bugs still remain which ruin the experience."
"What the heck?? I pressed the ""Watch Now"" button for 30 minutes of ad free music and I still get like 5 ads that play after! This happened 3 times now! What's happening? I thought when you pressed the button you get one ad that would play and then it would play music for 30 minutes..."
"I used Spotify for quite some time and I enjoyed all the playlists but when YT Music came with their recommended songs for every song that you played..well, this changed everything. It is clear that the algorithm YT, as part of Google, has is incredibly useful and more rewarding. It turned the tiresome task of searching through countless of song into one seamless joy like everything connected. Tough to beat here."
"Longtime premium user. like it but it could be so much more. thinking more intuitive interface, customizeability, and possibly even skins would be cool. Mabey its just the winamp lover in me but spotify is good not great. Also there is no chromebook interface (have to use the mobil) which glitches like clockwork on chromebook"
"Since the last update the queue was moved and instead the share button is on the bottom right, it's really annoying cause i look into the queue very often and nearly never share songs. Please reverse this!"
"Good service but this needs a UI overhaul. Your trying to make it so simple that it no longer becomes simple to use. Give the user more control over the layout and stop putting the ""like"" and ""hide song"" button so close to the playback controls."
"The latest update ruined everything for me. None of my playlists will load, and nothing in separate folders in artists I've added to my library will load anymore either. Please fix this bug asap."
Im a premium user and i love how i can save the songs that i like without the ads. However lately the songs will suddenly pause midway and I dont know what the reason is. Tried looking at the settings about it and even googled it but there's nothing. I hope this will be fixed coz it's a hassle specially when you're doing something then the music will suddenly stop and you'll have to press the play button again. This shouldnt happen specially to premium users.
The ads on this are ridiculous as they are always playing the same ones and it gets very annoying (and I am someone who connects it to my Playstation as I build things) and they get more frequent the longer I have it. ads shouldn't be there (in my opinion). I know they give the company money so they can keep it up but it is ridiculous. Some people don't get much money for premium. Next is the fact that there are songs in YouTube that are not on Spotify but are good songs. But I do like it.
I like the old Spotify where you can choose your own songs to listen to in a order but now you have it shuffled and in a random order and you have to pay to skip the songs you don't wanna listen to it's not fun and kinda ruined my vibe time ..
"They've made so many terrible design choices of late. The worst is with hifi sound, they changed it so that volume increments and decreases in steps of 5 now. While that's fine when you're out and about, when I'm listening in bed I want a volume of 1 or 2 depending on the song, but you can't do that while in the app, you have to get exit the app, change the colume then go back into the app. It's beyond frustrating. Oh and they messed with the search button for local music, you can't access setti"
"Recently the 'queue' button usually found at the bottom right hand side of the screen when looking at a playing song has been replaced by the share button. Why? It's inconvenient and makes no sense to me, as no-one I know uses the share button at all. Please just change it lads!"
"Definitely needs a ""Do you really want to delete this song from your playlist"" confirmation instead of just deleting without question. I have accidentally lost a couple of songs this way and don't remember what they were because it happened all so quickly."
"The thing with Spotify is that... It may be a business but it ain't kind to the people who can't afford the Premium for the app. Points I'd like to point out : It doesn't let you pick and choose the artist that YOU ONLY WANT TO HEAR FROM, but instead try show to artists that you have little interest in. It keeps reminding you that you should buy the Premuim for Spotify... You kidding me? I am already sitting through multiple ads before I even get to hear the song. And many more."
"Spotify is an amazing service, but the app has a terrible UI. Everything is a struggle: I can't even look at new episodes of all my followed podcasts. I can't search podcasts by a certain name and order them by date. It takes a long time to navigate from listening to music to scrolling to find a podcast I want to listen to in my library, then scrolling to the right episode that I haven't listened to, etc. The UI is not intuitive and takes A LOT of time to navigate. I would much prefer the way youtube has done it with subscriptions, new videos and their searching. That said, Spotify has amazing features for discovering new music, such as Song radio, that is essential for finding novel music that you're likely to like. I think out of all other services I use, Spotify would be the hardest to give up, but they need a serious app re-design since everything even slightly complex is impossible to do, and everything simple - takes a long time."
Switching the queue button from bottom right on the player with share is a mistake. YT Music appears to be catching up and its getting hard to ignore the YouTube premium bundle.
"Good app but the canvas on songs just basically disappeared, even on the settings, the canvas button disappeared too ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è i found out if I use another account (which is not premium) the canvas works perfectly. What an ass"
"Sometimes disconnects or refuses to connect when casting to PS4. Sometimes the music stops but the songs don't. Often disconnects from casting to PS4 because the phone app doesn't refresh to keep up with played songs and queue. Now I can't access the queue button as easily, and I strongly dislike that. Want to edit what album art is shown on playlists I made. Want to change my PS4 name when casting instead of just ""PS4-238"" or whatnot."
"Finally!! Thank you for adding real time lyrics to play alongside the songs, honestly saved me so much trouble. But please fix the issue where music doesn't okay even with a stable internet connection, that sux."
"Decent player with a good range of songs. Navigating the app itself is pretty bad, lots of issues and poor design. ."
"I dont mind all of the ads to much since it's free, but I hate how I can't replay songs or choose what song I want to listen to. I just have to hit shuffle and hope it shows up, or create a playlist with like 3 songs. There's no loop button either, and that sucks."
Great for music and all that but the UI has gotten worse and worse over the years. Why replace the 'see queue' button with the 'share' button and hide it behind the three dots. Never in my multiple years of using Spotify have I ever used the share function but I use the see queue function daily. The app is just becoming less user friendly.
"i don't care for the ui. lack of controls. for some reason i get more ads than others, so i tend to use other apps. sound quality is good, song selections are pretty good. it's just the interface i don't care for and all the ads. no volume control, no quick menu/settings. menu is convoluted, not terribly intuitive. i finally found the sleep function but no alarm function"
The lastest update is not good as before. Music suddenly stop itself and have to press the button to play the music. It is not comfortable if you can't press any button during driving or in the middle of something and the music stop itself. Please fix it.
"Recent change replacing dedicated queue button with the share menu should be changed back, as it's far more likely for someone to edit their queue than share a track with someone, an alternative would be to to move the share icon in the middle between queue and devices."
"It's alright, until the app decides to quit out on me at random times. It could be 5 minutes into opening the app, half an hour, or even 3 hours after opening the app."
okay honestly I love spotify i listen to music every single day for pretty much the entire day i have tons of playlists and love listening to music on here but i just came to the reviews because you guys switched the share button with the queue button and that sucks balls. pls switch it back i know its just one touch on my display but nobody cares about sharing songs more than viewing the queue
"I am on premium, the music paused by itself after awhile when in online mode and you need to keep pressing the play button. Very annoying!"
"Edit: This issue is still unresolved. Please look into it. Whenever I press the three dots anywhere, the app crashes. Also whenever I press the share button. I've cleared cache and reinstalled but the problem still persists."
Music quality is good but it keeps turning off after only 10 minutes of playing (quite often in the middle of a song). this is getting annoying.
"App is great. Great Playlist simple UI but really disappointed that there too much ads.after every while and after my premium ends ...there are always 3 ads coming together it's to annoying. Even recently i just got 3 ads , it's make it hard to enjoy the music. Also there is music by great artist unavailable..i can't find music by linkin park , ed sheeran. Atleast get the main stream. These issues are disappointing."
"I have a subscription. Software needs UX casting improvements. Cannot cast to device from Windows app. Why? Cannot listen directly on WearOS watch?!?! Why? I can pair BT phones to watch, right?"
Pretty good app but com on really you need premium to CHOOSE A SONG FROM YOUR PLAYLIST (or liked songs album) and you also need premium to skip a song or press that green button that randomly chosses a song and goes from there apart from that good app
"everything's perfect, but sometimes when I'm listening, the song stops and I have to go back to the app and press the play button again. when this happen once, it goes sometimes in a five-minutes-rhythm, what is really annoying. Another really annoying thing is that my favourite podcast includes ads in the beginning or ending sometimes. for what am I paying, when I get ads anyway?"
I have been using this app for quite long now. But recently it stopped working and shows no internet connection. Other apps are working with minimal network coverage. But this keeps showing no internet. This was one my favorite app for long time. So i tried reinstalling the app but no use. This time I couldn't even verify the account. It just keep showing stopped working.
It's amazing but I wish when you were listening to a song in a specific playlist that you could click a button from the listening screen to take it off the playlist instead of having to find it in the playlist and remove it that way. I say this because it makes it irritating to remove a song when I have a playlist with hundreds of songs on it so finding 1 song is a bit difficult but other than that I really love the app.
"Sometimes the like button won't work and sometimes you hit the song menu button and it just says, ""go online to see menu"". Very very annoying."
Is there a reason Spotify won't connect to Variis app on Android? Both apps are up-to-date an equinox claims the fix is to reset the Spotify password. That did not work.
"Experience on Bluetooth is unstable at times (stops playing when there's another notification on the phone, doesn't auto resume when restarting the car), stations repeat a lot of the same music, menus are not intuitive when you need to do more complex actions or manage your playlists."
"Its great but seriously, let us choose what songs we want to play, rather than being a whole shuffle. Its ruins the nice aesthetic it genuinely has."
"Doesnt let you save an unlimited amount of music only a limited amount even when you pay for the premium service. So kinda sucks that way. When you have all the music access at your fingure tips, or when you hit a dead spot quits playing, mind song and freezes then doesnt restart or the other thing songs stop playing mid song making you have to fast forward to continue the song again. Other then those negatives its a good app"
"It's fairly good, the music quality and selection is great, but the music player ui is so laggy on Android and iOS. In comparison to Apple music and even YouTube music, the animation bringing up the controls is so ugly and annoying."
"It is one of the apps I use most, so that tells it's own story and the premium family subscription is good value and works well for our household. However, there are some frustrating gaps in functionality that really detract from the user experience in my opinion. 1) The inability to add a whole album to the end of the queue rather than inserting all album tracks immediately after the song playing. 2) It would be good to be able to go directly to the end of the playlist or e.g sort the whole list by date added as scrolling through several hundred/thousand songs is tedious 3) The option to shuffle play all downloaded songs has gone. Having to add to the ""Liked Songs"" playlist and then download is not great."
"Repeating songs, I got Spotify Premium for ""testing"" it a little and it's horrible. Firstly ""Like song"" 's button is broken, I mean when I clicked on it, nothing change and I don't have song in my ""liked songs' playlist"". Secondly You don't have many of songs. I'm a little dissapointed. But quality of songs is great."
"spotify INDIA does not has all the songs and artists who are quite famous otherwise. It has limited songs of well known artists as well and that is kind of a backlog. I think you should provide more streaming into our region since our population too is big enough. The spotify version downloaded through VPN was better for me than this official one, to be honest. please work on it."
"Great app, and it's really nice, but why must I pay 10$ a month to simply play the song I wanna play? Maybe change the premium features.. I don't have money to just throw away like that. I might as well download songs off of YouTube, because it's both offline, and requires no payment. Sorry, but I'm not gonna support an app when there's an easier alternative."
"Love the service, but the selection module (music, albums, podcasts, etc) is a mess. Why not just add some buttons up top to make your selection? I never listen to podcasts here cause I can't find what I want, it's always the latest uploaded & no other way to choose. A mess."
Look dont get me wrong I like spotify but like could you stop adding songs to my playlists like please I just hate it .But like really did you have to ruin it that much there for it would be nice to instead do reccomandations that just add songs I clearly hate to my playlist .One last thing thank you for reading this.
I'm having issues with the app lately... The song stops though I don't pause it... And when I play it again the songs that had played before it stops plays again even though I disabled the repeat button...
"Ok what the hell is happening to Spotify, my chromecast(which was connected to my phone)just exist out of Spotify after a few seconds,.It's really annoying, hope they'll fix it quickly"
"Confusing payment process. Unresponsive support. In Saudi Arabia, when I want to subscribe to premium, the only option is to pay through Zain mobile carrier. So if you have another carrier you can't pay (?!). Not quite. After maybe a year of coming back and looking through the Spotify website and Android app, I have finally found a way to prepay using a credit card. Very bad design decision. You have made it difficult for people to give you money(!), and didn't reply to my support questions."
"Please for the love of God, make a way to sort your songs on the console version. I have over 700 liked songs and it's just a complete mess. Plus scrolling through that list, one song at a time to find the one I want is excruciating. Having the option to quickly scroll through songs would be wonderful."
"Works well has plenty of artists including some more obscure ones. Very difficult to navigate, obviously is designed to encourage people to use premium."
The UI is very slick but when it comes to audio the maximum volume is capped lower than other streaming apps when using earphones. I use the Realme Buds 2 wired earphones on my Nokia 8.1.
"I really love the app and I had it for years but recently when I try to share a song, the app suddenly stops and I can't do anything and all the buttons from my phone stop too. This happens with any song and it's really annoying. I uninstalled the app and installed again but this keeps happening. I really hope you could do something or maybe I should do something I really don't know."
"I love spotify have had premium for 3-4 years now and I was super excited when I noticed they added the lyrics button as a function, but randomly its now gone from all of my songs and the dumb ""behind the lyrics"" is back. I'd like to know why they would put that in just to remove it again and would like it back if possible, other than that my rating would be 5 stars"
"Variable performance with spotify connect. Great concept and works most of the time, but quite annoying when it doesn't- which is about 50% of the time"
"Missing one star as it's not functioning on lock screen anymore i. e. you need to unlock the phone and go to the app to quickly skip a song, very annoying. Used to be great, bring it back pls. Cheers"
"It's an amazing app from design up to functionality, but since last month I've been experiencing an issue, every a few days my downloaded song were deleted, I tried to fix it in many ways, I spend lots of data downloading again the songs. At the end I decided to move to another app Deezer."
app stops if i don't keep the screen or i have to keep hitting the play button ever since the update on the s9's. It keeps happening. This has to be fixed before you get Rogan on.
"To many features are subscription only. I'm personally a fan of free. I don't believe that anyone should be paying to hear music, or any form of Entertainment, as it's a luxury item we can all do without. This app is intermittent when you change between multiple playlist on bluetooth (after 3~7 playlist it will start to skip/buffer and not be audible). The selection is very wide but still mostly popular music genres, but it does have some good Celtic music, a great ambient noise selection & more"
The sound quality through Android Auto is horrible. Even if you uncheck the normalize volume setting it's so bad sounding and very quiet. It's the only thing keeping me from leaving Google music
"Comparing the android version of this app to ios is just a joke. The amount of features that are removed just makes it frustrating to use. For example, cover art on the now playing screen allows you to see left and right slightly, gesture navigations. Swiping down from the now playing to escape it, dedicated buttons to radio, browse on toolbar etc etc. If you're going to support both platforms do it properly and implement the same features."
"An otherwise excellent app, gr8 design and awesome fluid navigation s, but while the connection speed drops while in move, the audio quality is unacceptable as it keeps dropping and crackling noise is the in audio."
"Sometimes the ""heart""/like button works, sometimes it doesn't; regardless of interface (normal, car mode, Android Auto). Seems to be pretty basic functionality?? (OnePlus 7t Global, Android 10)"
Love the service but hate the app. If you choose to save your offline music on your SD card instead of your built in storage it causes everything to go painfully slow. The app constantly hangs while searching and browsing. Sort the app out and you get 5 stars.
Great selection. Sound quality is excellent. Menus are a bit awkward as is access to the equilizer. I'll problably switch to Youtube music or Stingray App at some point.
"I love Spotify. But there are two main problems, the first being the audio quality, and the second is that you can't turn off lock screen album art. Also the controls on the lock screen look a bit bulky (I like the old design better.) Would give 5 stars but there are problems."
"The ""dismiss"" button on the ads is supposed to close the ad, NOT take you back to the song screen. I don't want to see the freaking song screen but go search for other artists/songs! Can't even go back to the main screen -- have to exit the app to do that. Unbelievable."
"GET RID OF THE HIDE FEATURE NOW!!! I've used spotify for over 10 years. Seriously move that option at the bottom of the list because its making things difficult for a veteran spotify user, and yes I've been premium that whole time. I love spotify. Please don't ruin this one good thing about the world..."
"After the most recent update, the app will play only one song in a collection or album. After the song ends, I have to quit the app and restart it to play another song. And so on."
"I love this app with a passion when it works properly but, like Facebook, they've designed their interface so it's almost impossible to talk to an actual human when you have issues. My Spotify is super glitchy with my Chromecast and also has a habit of pausing itself repeatedly for no reason even when I'm not casting or using Bluetooth. Really frustrating that I can't even troubleshoot the problem short of using unhelpful,self-automated FAQs on the website."
"This app should be optimised to run on Android devices, swipe to que would be nice. iOS devices have also had a new spotify UI for the past 3 months now and android users were promised this new UI soon, which in most people's minds is NOT 3 months. Please release this NOW."
"Good service overall. Cons: poor security (no MFA), inconsistent UI across devices, and frequently repeated tracks after a while."
"Spotify is fantastic. Especially in recent years when theres been an influx of smaller (and bigger) artists from all over the world. However, it keeps crashing for me when I search for an artist and try to go to their page to see their albums and songs, despite what I do. I even tried factory reset on my phone without results. So sad I'm stuck listening to the playlists I already have, and can't add anything new to them."
"Great app overall, however there's room for improvement as it doesn't sync well between devices, and it's frustrating that if I open something, say in a search, then go to the library real quick, it will delete where I was at with my search (goes for all of the tabs - really annoying, as it would've been really helpful for navigating and creating playlists) - also I would love to see a feature in which you can save you queue real quick in a playlist (seen in Google Play Music; super practical!)."
"Keeps freezing nowadays, and sometimes songs become unavailable just as I am about to play them and then become available after 5 minutes, please fix this issue as it is ruining the premium experience."
"new update have broken the functionality: albums and artist tab takes ages to load, when entering saved album or -artist, its extremely slow. This needs to be adressed QUICKLY. Still not fixed as of 10 sep 2019 - rip spotify Edit 12/5-20 Lagging issues are more or less fixed. Some issues with the app crashing from time to time. Especially when listening to podcasts."
"I get that non premium member have to put up with ads , just a shame that when I'm listening to a relaxing playlist to try and relax before bed or to meditate , the ads are very upbeat and ruins my chill zone. Not sure if it's possible but would be great to have some more relaxing things as adverts on these kind of playlists !"
"new update ruined it for me. UI looks scuffed especially in the playlist section,overall the user interface is not smooth as before and it's noticable."
"Since I updated the app, I can't add any songs. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, and nothing. It's quite annoying!"
"I really like that i can play all my songs, and follow my friends, but... now everytime i click 1 of my songs it only plays half of it. And i cant click the button where you can replay it over and over. Please do somet. I rlly liked it when it didnt update like that."
"When it works properly, it's fantastic. 1. Bugs relating to wireless speakers. 2. Every so often it also stops playing randomly after only a few songs. 3. Loses sync with wireless speakers and displays incorrect song information on phone. 4. No easy way to organize music/artists/genres on mobile. Requires a special web app. But I love all the playlists I can create and share, and the ability to download music to listen offline is great."
"I love Spotify,I do,but when I'm playing the music on my mobile rather than my Ipad,it's hell.I can't choose which song I want to play which is a bloody nuisance and there are just so many ads.I would get premium,but I'm poor,so it's just I don't know it's not bad,but whatever I guess.Also,sometimes I won't be able to access my account even with my email,so I have to make a new one."
Spotify used to be amazing. But they ruined it. You can't even see your own playlist to chose a specific song!
"I'm suppose to give this a 4 star but with all due respect, I don't like the latest update. The features are quite complex and I can't download all the tracks in an album anymore. I have to manually like all the songs to make it appear in my liked songs. Plus that it always takes a minute to load whenever I wanted to put a song on one of my playlists. I hope you fix this soon, I prefer the spotify before this latest update came."
"Good music selection and customization. However, no dislike buttons to help spotify figure your tests out better, makes it a huge pain to explore new content."
I subscribe to the premium version. It was a nice in 2018 and 2019 however lately it's laggy and sometimes freezes for minutes. This is quite disappointing. Can someone explain why does this performance issue occur?
"I've been having a problem with this app since I stopped using premium. The app runs very poorly and the loading times on wifi and 4G take forever. The app also decides to crash half way through songs, decides to stop playing playlists and flat out refusing button presses in the menus. I tried to shuffle play Autolux earlier and it took 10 minutes, a cache clear, reinstalling the app and using 4g to get it to work. Crashed as soon as I locked my phone."
Poorly designed interface that has remained unimproved for years. Extremely unreliable behavior. App will consume all available storage on your phone. This has been a known issue since 2017 and still isn't fixed. In addition it does not property implement storage caching through Android OS. User must dig through in app menus to clear cache. Just had to clear the cache yet again. It was over 9GB this time.
Not as intuitive as Pandora and the listen on other device feature (great option btw) has a habit of freezing up on video ads. Great song choice though.
Very buggy behaviour on Android especially when casting. Downloading playlists is buggy. It fails to delete the playlists you remove from downloads and builds a huge cache. Recommendations get you stuck in a bubble instead of helping you find new ones. Most times they're unrelated to what I listen to or my library.
"Still no ability to see all of the tracks in your library, as well as an inability to shuffle said tracklist. Poorly organized UI."
This app is having a lot of connectivity issues whenever I try to cast to my tv. It would disconnect and just randomly pause which is quite frustrating when I'm busy and can't troubleshoot. It would also randomly stop shuffling my songs too. No other apps like YouTube have issues like this regarding my connecting to my tv. I expect better being a premium user.
When changing emails and/or phones if I made a mistake signing in the app could unnecessarily lock me out. I found the app too quickly went to that option.
Had it for a while it has worked super good just got a new app called Denser you can get Premium but if you don't you still have adds but you can listen offline and download playlist and when you don't know the song and you like it you just go into search and you press and blue button and you let your phone listen to the music and it picks it up the you can add it to any playlist you have just like Spotify
"I am happy with the current recommendation. However, I am in UK and I mostly listen to Indian Punjabi and Hindi songs. The recommendation is not very great when you launch the app and see only English songs on the dashboard although I am heavy rotator of Hindi and Punjabi songs. The App can be improved a lot as I think it still doesn't follow the material design guidelines of Android. I like the design of YT music and Google Play Music and would love to see similar in Spotify."
"UI issue: Seems like the ""Hide this Song"" option in the overflow/kebab menu is now listed at the top. This is really messing up my muscle memory, I keep hiding songs that I meant to add to a playlist. Fixing this would be much appreciated. I'd think most users add songs to playlists more than they hide them."
"Come onnnn Spotify....I never do reviews because either you're doing good or ya aren't and you know when you're not, but geezus....its Monday evening after work and all I want is to listen to my free version with ads (that work) while I shower. If I must listen to ads at least make sure they work! Now my shower wind down is ruined. If it's a matter of an update...please send me the update. No I'm not investing in Spotify AND paying for an ad free listen, it's not that deep for me."
"Spotify needs to create parity amongst its offerings, there is no continuity from mobile apps, to desktop apps to web player. The esoteric nature of qeueing is really annoying."
the first time I used this is okay but after two years... when I played one song..i can't listen to the next song because if I select the next button.. it turns back to the start.. please fix this problem..
Would love for Spotify to have lyrics like Amazon Music has. My bigger issue is that I cannot sort my podcast playlist on my Galaxy S8 even though I have reinstalled it 3 times. The sort button doesn't work. I am working with customer service and will edit my review if they manage to figure this out as I am a Premium member.
"Honestly it's a great app BUT... When it cuts out, it'll ruin your vibe. There's been quite a few times where I'd have amazing wifi, but unfortunately Spotify will cut out and there'll DEAD silence... Not fun when it tryna host a party üòÇ"
"Poor connectivity with Android apps! Firstly, it keeps saying 'something went wrong' even though I'm connected to the Internet. Secondly, while it's playing music, suddenly it stops and just doesn't play for a long time. All of a sudden after about an hour or so, the music resumes playing again! Why this disconnect in between?? I'm paying money every month and honestly I'm not quite satisfied."
"Please reduce the increments volume increase or decrease when casting. When I cast from spotify to my Marantz amp, the volume changes too much with one button click when using the volume up/down button on Samsung S9 Plus. Also, the app seems to ""forget"" that and goes to ""sleep"" mode. I have yo wait a while for it to pick up that it is casting to the amp. When casting to chromecast it does not happen."
The app occasionally doesn't load my liked song. Usually requires rebooting the app for this purpose. Significantly need to improve playlist/library load time and improve response time between clicking a song and it playing. Galaxy S10 user
Started off great as i have had it for years. The link between devices was a big selling point for me and used to great success. Unfortunately as time as gone on I have found the app glitchy and hap hazard. If playing it through a speaker/tab/tv/phone and controlling it from another devices it eventually loses function (around 5-10mins) on the controlling device. I think it is still the best value for money but issues such as not queuing up my music properly really test my patience.
"It's good but not that great. Reasons 1) can't rearrange songs in the playlist 2) don't have so many songs (some Indian local language songs ) which I want. 3) While using aux cable in car, It won't continue to play songs after restarting the car. Need to restart the app to play the song."
"This app is good for the first time you use. It is free you can skip songs all you want & search the song you want to hear. However, after I used the free trial version. It comes worst I can't even play the song that I search then it plays a different song because I can't disable the shuffle button. Hope this app improves more."
I wish they would bring back the search option when you are in a playlist. Makes it easier to find songs you want to listen to quicker.
"Now Playing management is horrible (one of many reasons: why insert new songs after current song instead of the end of the queue?). Also I want to PLAY LOCAL FILES! But... selection, app UX, and similar music algorithms are great - far better than Amazon."
"Some buttons are not working. When seeing the albums library, for example, the filter button does not work. It was very useful when I wanted to see only the album I'd downloaded. I hope it's fixed soon. It's been this way since the redesign."
"App looks good, but the UI is a bit unresponsive sometimes. Some important features are missing - played song history, weird queue system. And whenever I update the app, all my songs in the current queue disappear. Now I gotta search for them again, and there's no history to help me remember"
"I would love to give you a 5 star rating but lately I have experience way too many skips in my music while it's playing and it have become quite annoying. Please forward information on how to correct this issue, if it can be corrected. Thanks."
Not sure if its because I'm on the s20 ultra now and it's not quite been tuned properly for it yet but after about 2 and a half songs the music just stops playing and I have to click play again on phone to get it going only for another 2 and a half songs later when it stops.
"Have used for years and love it, but... 1. They pay artists next to nothing which is just wrong. 2. The new feature of ""liking"" songs and albums and ""like all songs"" has just made things really screwy. It makes it really hard to manage removing songs and albums I no longer want because there's two buttons that ostensibly do the same thing but have to both be set to remove to get rid of the music. It's also just annoying that my music library now sounds like an ig post."
This app is good but I'm not a premium but I dont like when I push a song that I want to play it only plays little parts of it and when I want to push the reapet button it dosent show it only shows an üö´ and there's no replay button and I dont like the new skip things where you can only skip 6 times an hour. SPOTIFY turn it back to normal with out the skip and the üö´!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why do I have to listen to about 16 songs on MY OWN playlist just to get to one song that I want and then I cant even replay it. It's never on any of my other devices like my xbox or my laptop it's only my phone which I listen to it the most on. It's the same with artists why cant I just pick the song I want to play and listen to it. Also why does it still give me an ad when you gave me the option to choose wether or not I want to have an ad. Its a good app but a lot of major flaws which ruin it
"Would be 5 star no doubt if premium was half the price but it's not. And I get forcing a 30 second ad on someone but multiple 30 second ads in a row, sometimes a third shorter one as well. A little overkill. Quicker to just close it out & reopen it. I mean at least make your consecutive ads total be less than the time it takes to just shut it off and turn it back onü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Just my opinion!"
"It's a good app, not excellent, it's a quite meh experience on android, on iOS it performs ten times better. One thing that i miss so much is a light theme. I know, spotify never had a Light Theme, but surely would be very welcome. And as a dark theme, why not to make it pitch black? It would be very adequate considering today's patterns. You know, Twitter is pitch black, Instagram is pitch black. Spotify could do the same."
Not even 50% quality to apple music...I tried first time with premium today with very high quality settings...vocals..high and mids are poor...its paining at higher volumes as same as GAANA and WYNC ...not equal to apple flac...unfortunately apple app is having poor UI in android ...otherwise I would never tried this....wasted money in research of spotify...your UI seems good and simple
There is a bug that after an ad plays the next song will be quieter and you cant get the volume back up unless you restart the app entirely loosing the song you were currently on.
So I have had spotify premium for a while and have loved it ever since I got it. Now just recently it required me to log back in after kicking me off. And now some songs are automatically skipped or there is no audio so it skips the song as if its unplayable when it doesn't show as unplayable. All I gotta say Some aspects of this new update are awesome. But some of it absolutely suck. Spotify Fix it Fast!!!!!! Update*** Now I think I am getting hacked or something. FIX THIS NOW!!!!!!!!!
I really love this app. Exceptional compared to the other music streaming services. But there's just one thing that I really hope the Spotify group will consider to update. Please include the lyrics for the songs in the app. I'm a premium user for quite a period of time so me and other users would really appreciate if that feature is available. Yes Spotify is the biggest music streaming service in the world but I'm afraid people will shift their loyalty to other service if Spotify stay this lame
"When I pay for a service, but it doesn't work 90% of the time. Cleared Cache, Cleared Data, Cleared Memory, Un and ReInstalled App, Ran Updates, Checked WiFi (Full), Checked Data Internet (Full), literally no reason for it not to work...and still it takes up to 5 minutes to load page. 1-3 minutes to recognize I have pushed a button. Spotify I want to give you back my 5 star rating but each month this gets worse and I am tired of paying for it to not work."
"Kind of seems this app had gone the way of Instagram, in that subsequent updates have brought about more bugs than improvements. Keep it simple Spotify! 2 years ago this app was glitch free. Now, it gets stuck loading up an album to play requiring you to go back a step and try again. Also keeps telling me I'm off line when clearly I'm not. For a paid service I expect it to do the basics, play music on demand. It's barely doing that at the moment despite clearing cache and other hopeful ideas."
"Great music recs, bad app design. App is frustrating to navigate, and I hate that I can't add my own music for streaming when Spotify is missing songs."
"Love the playlists. The only three criticisms would be: 1. limited options on electronic music for which I mainly use soundcloud and DI radio 2. the chaotic navigation which is not very intuitive as I still can't even figure out how to replay the previous song, and 3. poor connectivity issues on occasion with my Roberts radio which is very frustrating and for this alone I doubt I will be going past trial period sorry"
"Need some testers on staff. Songs fall out of sync and for the price of premium, I would expect a better user experience than... Just keep Googling for the answer that works. Caught me at a bad time. Working from home and can't play any new songs. I am probably going to have delete all local cache data and recreate all play data again. Just a painful user experience."
I love this app but I don't understand why you have a back button that you can't use. You can't even restart the song which I find really annoying when you carry on from the playlist and that I disabled everything to stop suggested songs from playing with my own playlist but they still play even though I already disabled it.
"Editing playlists should be easy. It's very tiring when you're removing some songs from your playlists. It requires me to tap so many times just to remove one song. Can't that be made in such a way that you can remove multiple songs? Please consider.. thank youuu. For some reason, I get logged out and I can't log in again. I have to install and uninstall and download all my songs again. Please fix. Thank you."
"I do genuinely love this app, it's my main way of listening to music. But even after updating, there's still no way for me to disable the ""behind the lyrics"" genius popups over the songs on android, and frankly it's really annoying."
"Spotify is great, you can play variety of music. The only problem is that after the update a few days ago when you play your playlist it will suddenly stop and you have to go to the app to click the resume button. I hope this will be fix right away."
"The student discount is nice but It takes forever to download music even with fast wifi! A repeated problem that Spotify seems to pretend to solve but never does. Took all night to download my liked music went to turn off the download button because I had enough downloaded then BOOM everything is freaking gone! Turn it back on, one song downloads, turn it back off and the one song stays?! So y'all really need to fix your download features! I pay good money!Would u guys actually fix the problem?"
"For some reason, the button to remove a song from a playlist disappear sometimes. Also that you can't began to play an playlist from an specific song, then, if i want to hear one that i haven't heard yet, i have to hear the entirely playlist, or hope that randomly take the song"
"I can't repeat a song on my phone nor tablet, and it gets frustrating to having to skip back to continue listening to it. I likf it before you updated it where the repeat button was on the botton right."
"Main issue I can no longer use the button on my homescreen to pause spotify (s8+) but also on some podcasts I listen to , it doesnt remember the last episodes that ive listened to and makes me go back to ep 1."
It was really good until an update came out then it just got really difficult to play music but apart from that it's quite good and you can also play music while going on other apps
It's the only way I use music because I can find stuff on here I can't anywhere else but the Current UI is completely useless and horrifically bad. Please for the love of God bring the old UI back please
"I LOVE SPOTIFY but come on, the app ALWAYS CRASHES I love the constant updates improving the look and design of the app and the way I interact with it but throughout my devices, apple and Android based it crashes constantly. I want to get high and listening to my music uninterrupted but you guys can't work out simple software flaws. I appreciate the constant development and innovation but bug fix your app I know you can afford it From Luke"
"Invaluable for its extensive music collection. Does not have mixtapes. Playlist management is poor. Social features are nice but very limited. ""Liked songs"" and ""Library"" is badly designed and has confusing UI. Genius lyrics integration has no option to turn off commentary. Could be so much better but alas there's no incentive for them to put in the work and make it so."
It should really add more of indian artist and songs which are available on youtube but arent available on spotify. It also has some issues with sidhu moosewala songs some of the songs dont play at all dont know why. But they should definitely work for it. And please dont try to ignore this comment its a genuine feedback for you and all this stars are for the quality you deliver its the best.
"this is a pretty good app. but that ""we added"" thing in the playlists are so annoying. yall add songs that I don't even know. the ads are not that annoying but that thing really ticks me off. please, remove that feature. it isn't helpful. or maybe just add a button to turn it of. thanks"
"Good app but everytime I update Spotify, storage setting (to store music) is always changing from SD card to internal storage. It's quite annoying as I have over 30gb of downloaded music and have to change it after single every update....can you address this issue with your next release??? Thanks"
I love this app but I'm taking two stars away because you can't just hit shuffle play with all of your saved artists to play random songs. They need a shuffle library button.
"I have really enjoyed this app, but lately it does this thing where it tries to download something but never does. I end up needing to uninstall it, restart my phone or force quit it. Can this issue please be fixed? My daughter is bugging me to get YouTube music."
Poor coverage of artists. Incorrect metadata that cannot be corrected. Poor navigation. Algorithms make little sense. No sign of the designers having any knowledge of UX design. I was trying before I buy but now I am seeking another service that has less shortcomings. Three stars because it is free and did not require credit card registration.
I want to be able to select artists and have playlists created based on those artist selections. This is one of the least intuitive apps I've used.
Wish it was quicker and easier to like a song or add it to my list. I know most songs from the title so don't like being forced to play and listen to a song before I can add it.
I have been a paying customer for many years and recently the problem im experiencing is that while listening to my downloaded music whether in my car via bluetooth or aux cable or earbuds the music will stop playing every 20 or so seconds unless I keep my phone screen on.... can anyone help with any information. Also I use my galaxy Note 9.
"Great application, but it's buggy and the load times are excruciating. I don't know why I need to be online to remove a song from a downloaded playlist, and I am online anyway, so the errors it gives me are wrong. It's quite frustrating."
"I would request you to please have some good old and latest Christian/ Catholic Spiritual Songs/ Hymns also on your list. Yes it is A very Good App which brings peace and soothing to the Mind and Soul. Make sure that some of the Song especially Rock Music, lirics have words of Blasphymy, Badwords, Rape, Sucidel tendencies, Promisquity, and other words that Could be Damaging to the Subconsious Mind of Tenagers/ Youth, Which is quiet Dangerous. Thank you for the Good Work that you All our doing."
"Can seem to play or view all songs by an artist only albums under disography. The ""shuffle play"" button on the artist's page doesn't play all songs, only a select few (I think even less than 100). Pretty annoying - feature I miss from Apple music. Which is now also available on Android"
New UI changes are HORRIBLE I turned off auto updates on apps and instill got hit with the new setup. awful. what navigation?? extremely bad choice. definitely thinking of canceling my subscription.
"The new update makes the shuffle feature only shuffle once and it changes to a pause button , so you have to play another Playlist before you can shuffle the first one again. Very annoying, I liked they way it was before where you could keep continously shuffling."
"I love all the access to the music everything I've ever looked for has been here. All of the ties you make two similar bands because I found stuff that never knew existed I play all the time and probably would never found without you, Spotify I love you, I'm still going to last though I don't quite get what it is I can do sometimes to the egg good things to play the whole album or something and I don't know what I missing the point if it's something I'm missing something. on 3mo free trail :)"
"Spotify is great for the most part. Often comparable to other music streaming services. I do find on occasion, it does freeze up or get stuck on a track title, despite continuing to play other songs."
App is fine except a really annoying feature on android TV. Anytime I press play button it opens spotify opens up and continues playing music from where I last left off even after a hold back and confirm I want to close the app. Really annoying as the play button is used for a lot of things on a tv like playing tv shows. It's not just for spotify.
"Everything is ok except latency, sometimes it takes 30min for a 3min song. And really annoying when Spotify plays on my Google Hub, it binds its volume control to my phone's hard media keys even I do not open Spotify on phone or even close it via phone's app switcher. I have to force stop it to get back media control to work as designed. Please stop abuse hard media keys, they are not designed to use only for Spotify."
"Solid music experience. Need theme options; the UI is dated and wretched to look at. Also no longer able to share to Instagram, which is strange. Need to be able to access local files from mobile too, not just desktop. +/- 15 second seeking toggles for podcasts never work. +15 seconds always rewinds about 0 seconds for me. Fix ASAP"
When music plays for alarm it is buggy. It plays normally and three minutes later plays again with a glitchy sound. The app says no music is playing until you tap the play button.
"It's a very good app, but when I go on my playlists and press on a song to play first, it only gives a preview when I want it to play the whole thing like it used to. It's quite frustrating"
I don't really like that you put the like button right next to the pause button in the lower sidebar. I sometimes accidentally press unlike and it screws up my order. I know it's nifty but then again I don't think the button right next to the play button is necessary or adds much to usage pleasure.
I would like to ask a quick question. Why on Earth would it ever be considered a good idea to add random songs to a set playlist?! If I create a playlist with the purpose of a certain energy why would you ruin it?
"The song collection is too good and the recommendations are dope too, but when you press the settings ( three buttons) near the song or playlist the app crashes badly. I have done everything like uninstalling the app, formatting my mobile but it the issue is still there hope so Spotify fixes this problem."
"The Good. 1. Has a wide variety of music. 2. Has a decent selection of pre-generated playlists. 3. Search button actually works and does not equal to app-breaking advertisement. The Bad 1. Unlimited skips are not a thing - It has a 6 skips per hour limit, compared to PC (Windows, have not checked on other Operating Systems), this is 100% free (with the occasional ad which is muted instantly). 2. Has a rather sluggish player (It takes 100ms for a pause to actually occur, could be an issue with my phone's CPU). 3. Uses a lot of storage space. Make sure to set the storage to your SD card. I'm currently at 2GB of cached storage. The Ugly 1. When searching a single song, you are forced to listen to the whole damn album just for one song. ü§£ Level 20 Bruh moment. ü§£ 2. I swear this app uses more bandwidth then the Windows version. I set this to High, but it sounds like an Apple Series 1 Airpods. 3. In-app advertisements take the fullscreen, can you please get the f*** out of my face. At least, the Windows version is just an audio version. Verdict: Many silly things need to be removed or I'm still going to pirate my music because I'm not paying for G A R B A G E. Sent from my 2017 GUCCI Smart Massage Chair."
"No doubt the song collection and the audio quality is great. But one thing I don't understand is that, if I paid for the spotify premium subscription then why does the app requires to download them daily through internet connection. What's the point of buying the subscription when my phone is using my data to download those songs daily"
"Love Spotify but... Spotify has a poor buffering algorithm. If the bandwidth is low its unable to detect and simply pause the song and buffer, instead it just plays 1 second, stops, plays one second, stops. Lack of play history on android SUCKS! Also, give us the ability to convert a discover weekly playlist into a standard playlist so we can keep it. Also, give us the ability to like a song from the phones lock screen. I could go on, I'm a UX tester and would love to help, get in touch!"
"The range of music available - fantastic. The app itself - garbage. Huge drag on phone performance, and has a nasty habit of not loading at all. I had the app in offline mode,it crashed, then I could not sign back in as the app believed I was in offline mode. Make a less data heavy UI please and I'll come back!"
"Without a doubt, Spotify has the best UI among its competitors. But being an user from India, there is a major portion of songs from famous artists missing. Hoping Spotify can bring these to India soon."
"Love the app but it doesn't have a history function and works poorly with my echo dots, they are always out of sync and I'm not sure which is to blame, spotify or my echo dots. I want a suggested playlist full of new music for me, not a playlist of music I already like, just make a suggested music button I can click and play me new music according to my taste in music."
"Got rid of the quicker option to search the playlist at the top of a playlist and not have to click extra buttons. When I search up songs on WiFi, it sometimes pops up that I'm offline even though I am not on other apps. Queue list is notorious for glitching out."
"So far, music quality and streaming is good. The problem I'm encountering with the current app is that every time I press the more (3 dots) button, the app hangs and then crashes. Downloading music or edit settings is frustrating. PLEASE ADDRESS THIS MATTER."
"love the app, but too many times it just starts playing on my phone when I use the pause button for spotify connect, or misses the ball another way I can no longer choose the order of my playlists, which is not very handy, it sometimes changes that seemingly random, which is frustrating also the podcast option isn't very handy, might be better in a seperate app? all in all I'm a spotify fan, but the app needs some work"
"I really love this app but lately it became buggy (I have a Premium subscription by the way): it can suddenly stop playing music in the middle of the song, it also stops often when it's connected to my bluetooth speaker. I have galaxy s9 and i cant switch between songs on the locked screen which is quite annoying. Also if I receive any sound notification on the phone, it will pause my music for 5-7 seconds, I'd prefer to nope have it paused. Hope this can be improved."
"I'm 67, so I have a more difficult time getting what I want. I never used computers in my job. I have used computers since I was 40, but I will confess I haven't needed to learn much because my husband is the kind of guy that builds his own. So, if you could make recommendations, I really like the capacity of this app. I just have to learn how to use it. Thanks!"
"My Spotify always crashes if I press the song settings (or long on the song), to add it into my playlist or in my queue for example.   I've already reinstalled Spotify and changed the battery settings I am using mi 6a miui 11"
"Spotify as a service is great. However their app is terrible. For one they have made poor design choices such as having to take an extra annoying step when searching for a song in your own library or not being able to sort playlists etc. Another thing which causes endless frustration is having songs just not start at all, I can load a 4k YouTube video easily yet playing a 3 minute song means I have to restart the app multiple time to get it playing. That app needs serious work."
"Very good listening, very little stuttering, good UI and an excellent premium service. However, the mandatory ad at the start which gives you ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" is a lie. On the way back from school I used this app, and I first had an ad which gave me half an hour of no ads. However, 15 minutes later, 5 ads played consecutively. Maybe it's a bug?"
"Good music player BUT the way the play queue works is annoying (I try to play an album, it plays one song then reverts back to queue) and there's no quick way to scroll through the library."
It's a great app. Easy to use. Offers a wide variety of music. Just about every kind. From most classic to most recent. Quite incredible. Perfect playlists and recommendations. This app is definitely winning.
Been using this app for streaming music but lately it stops playing whenever one song ends. I have to open my phone and press the play and pause button before it could play again. Please fix this
"Great music streaming ap. HOWEVER, it has serious bugs. Why for example on occasion does my phone (s9+) require unlocking to listen when yesterday it didn't? Why do I have to enter offline mode to listen to music I have already downloaded when I dont have service? Why does it frequently not allow me to change tracks using a headset in various vehicles when connected via Bluetooth and other days it's completely fine?"
Good content but frustrating experience. It's very hard to prevent the app from shuffling playlists (with premium). When you open a playlist there is the BFS (big ******* shuffle button). If you then select the first song it will play that one and then jump to whatever random other song was in the queue before. Why can't there be a BAP (big awesome play button) on the playlist page that when pressed plays all the songs in the playlist in order like any other music player does?
This is a very good app but the ads are getting very bad. I was one spotify and I clicked the button that said watch one ad to get 30 minutes free. Literally 5 minutes later there were 2 ads back to back
"The app will stop working after a few songs and requires you to press play again or reopen the app. Really annoying when you're in the middle of something and can't get to your phone! Update: the issue still has not been resolved, so I dropped another star on my review"
"I really dont think the premuim is necessary. I think that you have great app and all... but i like not being able to pay for streaming music. Thou, i know you need money. I would rather have a free app then you have to pay for it that is why I gave this app 3 stars."
"Could've easily been a 5 star rating, but one thing the app needs to fix is the repeat button. Everytime a new song is played it doesn't stay on repeat."
It's okay but it would nice it had the ability to stream music from a cloud service since not all music is on Spotify. The UI needs work. It's too cluttered
"Where is your account information? The only bit of info in the settings is your account name. I need to go online to the spotify website just to find my username, there I can scrape together my password and manage my spotify premium. Why is the app designed to show you as little information as possible? Even paying for the service, it's always been frustrating that there is no access here."
"All in all it is okay. The apple version on my iPad is just better. For the S10 this app is average. The equalizer options are weak, not good. Low customisation in that case. On locked screen, I cant pause a track? Which is quite weird... in my opinion for Samsung it is just not good enough...Full potential of the new S10 is not used."
App likes to freeze and not start up like it should sometimes and sometimes the music likes to buffer for quite a bit before even playing even when I have full bars of service.
"Expensive and there could be a rewind 5 seconds button, but I recommend it - not the premium version, there aren't enough features to convince me to give you my money."
"Almost perfect apart from the fact that songs just stop if my screens turned off. Not pause, just stop. I press the button on my earphones to resume the song and it plays for around half a second then registers that I pressed it, so it pauses. Only one other person I know has had this problem. Otherwise, great app"
"I like that it has every music you wanna try out and the songs your in to,the point is there is a search and I love that bc every time there is no search button! well I hope all of you enjoy SPOTIFY!"
Shows pop up ads in the podcast interface. (If you're not a premium member) There are other high quality apps that will play podcasts without ads. (Other than the audio ads built into the podcasts)
"Been using for years, and I'm just now questioning why they took the dislike button away from Radio playlists. Now you can only ""heart"" (favorite?) songs but you can't dislike them. So I'm forever stuck with certain bands playing that I don't like on radio?"
"Somewhat buggy and not very intuitive, but once you've worked round this without tearing your hair out then you get to listen to lots of music, so ultimately it's worth it. Ironically it used to be more stable and slightly more intuitive. Such is progress."
"The app is generally very good, but if my data signal drops or is weak for even a second, Spotify never reconnects unless I quit and restart the app."
"Its my first time on Spotify and i quickly turn my account to premium, i find it weird the songs freezes man specially in offline even online and sometimes when i log-in it says im offline. Pls fix it :) or ill regret having it"
"The app is great and I would love to buy a subscription as a student, but sadly none of the offers are available in Quebec. This is quite frustrating as all the other provinces in Canada have access to the offer. The other plans are simply too expensive for me to pay. I hope this will be addressed soon"
"Hi, I've used spotify for a long time and now I got some issues with sharing the songs to instagram stories. The share button are there, but when I tap it just stop at the camera on instagram and not get to the sharing windows in instagram. can somebody fix it.??"
This is trash on andriod compared to apple. I love it on apple (as i have a andriod and an apple) the controlls are eaiser. But that is not what i am complaining about. The stuipid app wont let me go back to the songs that are actually on my playlist from the ones that are not. I have turned this off in the apps stetting but it is not working KMN! Plz help. I am getting sooo strested. Thx for being opeb to comments
It dosent have just a play button for my playlist. Just suffle play and it never plays from the beginning. It's really annoying and I want that fixed or tell me how to fix it myself.
I have premium so it has no ads. I would have given five stars but the Samsung Galaxy watch app really is horrible. Signing is such a chore for me. Constant nuisance it keeps signing out.
I love Spotify but most of my user experience is constantly force stopping the program in order to make it function properly . Would be nice if that wasn't the case.
"im sorry to say but thr app is not all that it used to be amazing but scine the update it is way more confusing i was a premuium user but i stoped paying even though i continue using the app because it is the only thing that i have enough space on my phone i do not think you sould use it my experince was amazing at first after a few weeks it started to suffle every playlist i listen to no matter what it is i listen to 3 songs then it starts to suffle my playlist, just do youtube insted of this."
"New UI is awful. Other services are otherwise good but the new UI removed like all good UI features in your library. There is no Songs tab. -uninstall Spotify -Download an older apk, good Spotify back -Never reupdate the app"
"It's okay in design but glitches a lot despite paying premium. for example, Settings keep greying out. It recommends some petty stupid music given play lists saved and would be better having some more album recommendations from saves artists. That's said, it's the best app available atm."
It was quite annoying cause the first week it let's me have the icon of repeat and queuing my songs.now I dont know how to repeat my songs cause where the repeat icon usually is is replaced with blocking the song so if anyone knows how to repeat a song please help me.
"Everytime i go to music setting (3 buttons for option) the app freezes and i can't do anything but close the app and launching it again however upon lunching again, the app stuck at the entry logo."
"Experience has been great so far, been having an issue though where the music will abruptly stop playing even though my phone is on, but will start playing again if I touch the volume button, home button or screen lock button. Have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times but it still occurs."
"I love Spotify for the most part, it's the app I use most for streaming music. I'm a paying family plan member and am pretty happy with it overall. Would give 5 stars with audio balance function. Support could be a little more caring also. It's pretty lame. Also kinda irritated about the family plan, my kids don't live at my address so I can't add them? That's lame too. I'm keeping my eyes on the competition for a more fitting service to pay for. Amazon and Google are close but not quite yet."
"I really enjoyed the features presented, new songs were immediately registered, but, unfortunately the premium features for students could only be obtained by college students, I as a high school student could not access premium features for students, it made me quite disappointed."
"Since some time the app has quite some difficulty reconnecting to the internet (says ""no internet connection available""), and only closing and re-opening it solves the issue. It is annoying, but other than that, it is pretty nice."
"Spotify has been my default music app for pretty long time and was really satisfied by the the playlist recommendations and UI. So for the first time I paid for a premium membership on any apps. But later when I searched for songs from particular artists, only then did I know that LOT'S OF CONTENTS were not available in India (especially Ed Sheeran, Linkin Park, Cold Play and the list continues). I suggest Spotify to make available songs from at least the famous ones."
"I use it all the time but the ""we added"" part of playlists are genuinely annoying and I cant make my own playlist if you add songs I dont want to listen too fix this and 5 stars."
"The latest update has allowed the app to periodically stop playing music while my phone is locked. I play music for long periods of time and it is quite frustrating for a number of reasons. I do, however, like the option of locking out explicit songs from playing. Please fix!"
This app is stupid because it forces you to listen to songs that aren't even kn your damn playlist. For example it you add one song onto a playlist you can't even listen to that song because it forces you to press shuffle play which plays songs that aren't even on your playlist which is a very stupid design choice
The recent update sucks. I usually watch and browse my plaslist and from there I could skip songs. Now I onlz have access to the like and pause button. There is enough space to add the skip button in the interface so please add it again. I don't want to jump into the artist just to skip the song.
"Like many others I have recently started having major issues with internet connection - showing offline when it's not and cutting out when it's playing. Super frustrating since this application has been so great in so many ways and I have been a subscriber for quite a while now. Please fix the bugs from the latest update or help ppl figure out what settings are not set properly, this is such a great app otherwise!"
"This is a good music app but there are better ones out there if you look hard enough, what's with the music on the end of my playlists I don't want to listen to them so I make a playlist and they are there before I want to play my music. This app can also be confusing to use i.e when I'm playing one artist and another completely different one comes up. It's just irritating to use and more of a nuisance to use so I am going to use s different app. Have a good day."
"While the sound quality is impeccable and the UI is intuitive, I have been facing issues recently. The app randomly switches to offline mode and requires a restart when I am clearly online. A smaller issue is that sometimes the album covers don't even appear."
"This app has great music dont get me wrong, but when I search for a song I want to hear I dont want to have to press a Random Song button and hope it will be the first track. What happened to ""I select the song I get to listen to the song"" not a preview of the song? Or is that only for Premium Members?"
for some reason i can play without shuffle on my amazon fire tablet via the app but yet on my chroombook i have to listen via shuffle via the app every damn time no way to turn it off i had the same issue with my windows laptop when i had it THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION REGAURDLESS OF FREE ACCOUNT quite suprise people have not axed this damn app/site for that alone VERY ANNOYING youd think the amount of ADDS THEY THROW AT YOU MAKES YOU WATCH VIDEO ADDS TOO that it should be an option
"On Xaomi Redmi 8 pro the spotify freeze down a lot for example i can't give any songs to my Playlist, because everytime when i want to press that settings button in the right corner of a song all the spotify freeze down and i have to restart the app..."
"app often comes up with quite a few problems in connection with phone under some kind of power saving mode, however works well mostly for the rest. Would appreciate the ability to add to Instagram stories, don't understand why this is not available on the android app, PLEASE add this simple function"
It would b muhj better if ny music wouldnt randonly stop and also its quite expensive for a music app. I love the variety of music they offer but not a fan of having to stop my bime just to press play again bc i got a call and it wont keep playing on its own...even if i dont take the call.
"Great app but I have two issues: 1) I cannot reorganize the queue or remove songs from it when listening on a wifi speaker 2) The search bar and sort by button where great, but with the new update it makes it annoying to 'find a song in playlist' or to sort it by 'recently added' for instance. Also my downloaded songs keep getting deleted and the solution also requires me to re-download over 1700 songs"
Good for mainstream music. Missing quite a few songs from various artists. Also some rather irritating bugs like the app not connecting to the internet.
"Giving 3 stars because of features being pointlessly removed. Firstly, landscape mode was removed making my car phone mount useless. Then they removed the widget, which forced an uninstall on your phone without your doing. Now instead of having convenient buttons at the ready, you have to unlock your phone, open the app and open the player."
"In the new update some thing happend well first off My playlists songs aren't playing in order its quite Annoying.2: The artwork for the album/song won't show its just white,now of course this doesnt really matter but it's annoying none the less. Over all its a great app and I love it but please can you fix these bugs? thanks"
The new update kinda ruined it. I wish I didn't have auto update on. It still plays songs but now you have a limited amount of skips. I've asked people about it but they haven't updated yet. DONT UPDATE! I kinda want to delete it but I am still looking for a new app.
"The UI is getting worse. Press and hold doesn't work anymore, poor design makes it a pain for one handed use. Get it together Spotify!"
"Spotify, although in theory has good UI, ends up being clunky with poor load times. Sometimes all can seems well, then you open an artist and bam 3mins worth of loading to a time out. Awesome. Try again. Meeeerp. Same again. Mint.... Just wasted so much time trying to listen to music. This is on Wifi with good connection and 4G. Going to start building my music collection again and move to Foobar2000."
"It was a five star rating from me when something unusual happened suddenly. I wanted to remove some songs from my playlist, but when I press the 3-dotted button it just hangs and does not allow me to view the options like ""add to playlist"", ""remove from playlist"" etc. I uninstalled and reinstalled, but it is not working. If this is a bug on your side, please fix it and you will gain another ""five stars""."
"""All songs"" gone. Love this app and the selections. The worst update design though is getting rid of the ""all songs"" tab, it's just not the same anymore."
"Quite often I'll get 9 seconds into a track and it will stop, telling me to go online. Restarting, clearing cache, does not seem to help. It'll start back up when it seems to be good and ready ... I have the same issue on multiple devices and as both free and premium"
All the music you need...In the playlists would be great to have one-touch buttons for Add to queue and Like. Just a thought...
"Good app, but I have been having to uninstall and reinstall the app a few times these past few days. I have android auto, and sometimes it will work...other times it will just say that nothing is available. I'm a bit annoyed, and I'm debating continuing to use this app or not.."
"Great app, until that recent update. Liking an album no longer adds to your ""liked"" list and now requires you to individually like each song if you wanna add it to that list..."
"I enjoy listening music on Spotify , specially because there is no buffering. It is also designed in such a way that searching a particular piece is very much easier. One more thing I like about Spotify is , there are minimum adds , in comparison to other music apps."
"Music keeps stopping when my screen is off. I have to either keep pressing the home button to have the music start again or leave my phone unlocked with the screen on the entire time. It works fine with bluetooth headphones, but otherwise it's a very annoying problem"
You can't swipe to queue songs. This is very annoying and a feature that is present on the iOS version. The app has started playing short music videos in the background that I can't seem to disable and add nothing to the user experience (who is watching these??) Would be 5 stars otherwise.
It's a really nice app but it's disappointing that they don't have some other artists that deserves to be noticed. Another thing that's disappointing is that we have to pay just to remove ads. It's quite annoying to have to listen to the same ad telling me to pay just to remove it.
"I'm a premium member I decided to buy out the whole year , a couple months ago the app was fine. My biggest problem is that download button on your liked songs, God forbid you hit it. All your songs just undownload so you gotta redownload them back, and your app uses the most data. If you guys don't fix that I will not be renewing my subscription"
"Been a premium user and never had problems until last month. I thought they woul fix it quick but until now the app keeps crashing and some buttons would freeze the app when clicked. On the PC it's fine but a lot off issues on the phone app. Subscribed to Deezer, as they offer hifi on some dollar up. Thank you for the long friendship Spotify."
"Respecto a Android, est√° muy bien, pero le quito dos estrellas por quitar Spotify para televisores Samsung viejos, antes llegaba a m√≠ casa a escuchar m√∫sica mientras estudiaba. Regarding Android, it's very good, but I take away two stars for removing Spotify for old Samsung TVs, before I came to my house to listen to music while studying."
"Great for music, but it is the only app where the volume button skips don't work, as well as the pause play action, on bluetooth headphones."
"Recently the only songs that are being played on my playlists are one's that I don't enjoy, forcing me into using a different service. I am quite disappointed because I have use this one for so long and now it's going downhill. I don't have premium, but my friends that do all have the same issue."
"For a Premium user, it's a ho-hum experience with this mobile app. Already build some playlists I enjoy, but the app is a headache. Recent updates screwed up the payment plans, so I wasn't on premium for 2 months. After that's fixed and was able to sub again, just this recently, I was getting annoying full-screen ads for their premium subscription, WHICH CLEARLY I'M ALREADY SUBSCRIBED TO. I'm starting to think about not wasting that 10 bucks next month if these issues still persist."
Great app as premium (I have family pack for my self and my girlfriend) for more than a year. With few tweaks it has great sound too... Unfortunately every now and than it deletes all of my songs download on my phone and if app was set on offline mode it is mostly impossible to log in ad turn the app back to online with out reinstalling it. Im not shure is this so there is more milions of downloads of this app or is it just a glich but it is quite annoying. Espetialy on trips abroad.
"why my apps keep on crashing? like if i pushed the three-dots button, the app will freeze and i have to force close it. even i cant click pause button in the notification bar. can you help me?"
"The song quality for Spotify free is good enough, but the only thing which is not making this a number one music app in India is that it doesn't have all the songs of all the artists which are quite famous. Please fix this ASAP. Bring all the artists and songs to India. Ex. Linkin Park, Twenty One Pilots, Charlie Puth and many more....."
"Great app but the caps/bugs on following/saving songs make it unsuitable for migrating existing libraries without maintaining a record of what you like - just incase you start randomly losing follows. If you use the app purely for streaming and not for keeping a list of artists you care about etc, then 5 stars. Support team are also very helpful, even if unable to fix the above issue."
"Not quite there yet in terms of using proper design patterns for Android, so I keep getting confused with navigation. What's more annoying is that Search seems broken, after the first search the keyboard hides, and you can't get it back. You have to go to the home screen to start search again. Quite annoying"
First off it's a good app. It dose all it says on the tin. However the latest update has made the Mobile version confusing if you want to look through an artist's albums as the update has hidden them behind a button and just makes it more confusing and less convenient to use.
"The service on the whole is great, but the Android app is always being broken by their updates. Right now, Chromecast support for albums is broken for many people, with lots of people reporting issues in the Spotify forums. And it's been ongoing for weeks! What have Spotify done about it? Nothing.... apart from ""we are looking into it"". How hard can it be to to check back a few versions to when it wasn't broken? Also... that damn awful ""shuffle"" button without a ""play"" button. Thousands of requests (by paying subscribers) to have the option of a play button instead of shuffle button go completely ignored, without any reason why from Spotify. Terrible company."
The fast forward and rewind buttons disappeared from the notification bar and lock screen. I find this very annoying when listening to podcasts.
"The app is delightful, but it has been quite unstable lately. It's awfully slow, and crashes constantly in my Huawei Honor 8X. If this goes on, I won't hesitate in canceling the membership."
Keeps freezing and stopping playback. Since the updates it keep pausing for no reason even with downloaded audio. It's becoming a nuisance. Not reliable anymore while driving.
"Look I love spotify and used it for a few years now but gonna stop changing stuff, like taking away the save album button that's just annoying my whole library has been built up doing that and because I haven't 'liked' an album it's gone from my library and I need to re add stuff constantly, please stop. Also there's often a massive delay between choosing an album and that album actually loading, I have an S10 and constant 4G and Fibre BB at home so it can't be any of these."
"Please add function to like all song within a giving playlist or album. Having to individually add songs from a playlist or album to your ""liked songs"" designation is frustrating."
"Spotify has been great until recently. Now for just about every song while playing goes silent for several seconds and then plays again. Then, there are times where the song stops and I need to press play again. What's going on with Spotify? It's quite annoying. Please fix this ASAP please."
"I love the way you make a playlist for me which I can listen to with peace , I dont really mind the ads since it doesn't appear that much {} The ads are quite longer than usual now..And it's like 3 or 4 ads at once {} minus 2 stars from me because of that"
"It works good in ios, but there are a lot of disruptions when I use on my android devices. When I'm feeling the song and it stop, so that I've to press the button or touch the screen to solve the disruption. I'm not sure that this problem came from my phone or the app. This really annoys me. Just so you know that I'm almost satisfied."
"You guys need to fix the bugs from the last update. It keeps freezing mid song, then starts playing. It's quite annoying."
"Personal bug bear of mine are apps/eco systems that completely remove stable, working elements of functionally with no replacement. Particularly when it is a paid premuim service. My use of this Spotify app has more halved since they have removed the one touch to continue playing via the home screen widget from Android devices. I have found myself jumping in the car and opting to play podcasts from their widget rather than opening up the Spotify app."
"I would give 5 stars, but due to the fact that the app will quit playing music randomly with me being a premium subscriber? And I'll have to close the app out completely and restart it? I'll only give 3 for now. Please fix that and make it to where if I queue songs that it doesn't mess up my shuffled playlist please. Love the app and think it's a LOT better than pandora, but I'll switch if that isn't fixed."
"it's a good music app and everything, but whenever i use snapchat, or my phone's camera to take a picture the whole app stops and restarts the song. and itll play an add right after you click the ""no thanks"" button ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Using samsung note 9, whenever my phone goes into lock without pressing the button, the song that is being played cuts. Please solve this problem. Has been happening quite sometime now, thought there would be an update regarding this, but issued have not been solved."
New version sucks. Randomly stops playing and the new setup is not user friendly anymore. Queuing up songs has or albums has become tedious.
"It's works well, but there are features missing in this app which are present in others making them very good. Can we have a clear queue button rather than scrolling/play work arounds? Can we have a button that allows us to play our entire music library? Or shuffle our entire library? These are features I had on play music which made it very appealing and good to use."
"Can't ever report songs for explicit content, which happens quite frequently. One song had at least 6 f-bombs, along with other profanities, amd it wasn't listed as explicit, despite its obvious use of expletives. When I try to report, it says it can't and to try again later. Every. Single. Time."
"I've been using spotify premium since last year,, but this past few months i notice a problem when listening, after a 6 to 8 songs it suddenly stop playing.. i still need to open spotify again and play the music again so it could resume playing, i really hate to stop driving just to get my phone and touch play button. Even my headphones touch to play won't work.. pls fix this.. when I'll notice this issue is fixed, I'll give u 5 star.."
"I love Spotify, I've been using it for quite some time now and it usually works well but recently it's been starting and stopping my music when my phone is locked for no reason. Please fix as soon as possible or I'll cancel my subscription and find a new music app."
"Switched to paid version a couple of days, since then constant interruptions, a song I'm playing just stops for couple of seconds, resumes on it's own or by my help. This happens no matter the playlist, if I'm using mobile data or Wi-Fi, and no matter the device - smartphone or laptop. Not happy! If it's continuing switching to free version!"
"As mentioned by quite a few people before, with latest updates the music stops randomly and/or the app crashes. Sometimes pause and previous /next track buttons remain as if the song was still playing but there's no sound. Seems to happen for me both on and off wifi connection."
"The app was impressive for it's interface design. I love the simple dark design and useful feautures of Spotify app. However, I have observed that internet connection within using this app is not stable and weaker comparable to other apps that I use with internet. Also, the ""play next"" feauture is missing in this app which is for me an essential for every Music apps. Nonetheless, it maintained its reputation for being the ""most grossing"" music streaming app for android."
"The widget is back, so there's that. The UI is still ridiculously slow, it takes 3.5 seconds to open an album view. Quite frustrating."
3 stars cause I'm struggling with actually having my name on the actual profile. It's got some randomly generated user name which I cannot seem to change. For that reason it doesn't quite feel like my own set up. I'd appreciate some help with this.
Could be better if so many songs weren't unavailable and there was a option to view all the songs from an artist in a single list.. Hence it needs minor ui updates..
What happened? Premium user. I have to have my screen on to hear the music so I open Waze. Unfortunately it drains my battery quicker and who wants to have their screen open to Waze while you're working out? Is this going to be fixed?
"The app works fine but they completely ruined the navigation and just browsing your music, I can't find a tab to just look at a complete list of artists or albums I have saved, and the recently played is still there but the side scrolling makes it annoying to browse, the long vertical list is just easier. The whole app organization was changed a few months ago and I think it was completely unnecessary and is very annoying, and I wish I could just navigate the app like it was before."
"Stop removing useful functions please! Previous version allowed me to switch offline mode on and off with a button from the notification panel. Now one needs to dig into the settings. Also it has gotten super slow, so going through the settings takes a long time. Android."
"My biggest gripe is the lack of a dislike/downvote button. I read on your forums that you won't give us one is because it feels too negative, but how else are your algorithms to know that when I ask my speaker to play ""goddess on a highway"" by Mercury Rev, I don't want to hear an obscure 90s bootleg, but the album version? Choice is important, and personal preference is both negative and positive, and your algorithms won't get smarter if you don't collect data on what people don't like as well."
"Spotify is one of the biggest apps and yet it still manages to have more bugs, issues, and crashes than any other app I have. It's great for discovering music as they have an enormous library (the only reason for 3 stars), owing to they're share of the market. But I'm continuously infuriated by its UX"
"I tried the premium which is great! I switched to free, cause premium is quite expensive dor my budget but seriously in free you just listen the basics there are so more that you can discover! The reason I write this review is that I tried to have the student premium and it doesn't have my greek university (by the way it called ŒëŒ£Œ†ŒëŒôŒ§Œï) and its silly cause I do have the student ID."
"The adds in the middle of nowhere üôÑ look I'm not THAT rich to throw money at anything and everything... After all I AM paying for the data aren't I...?? It would have been better if I didn't get those loud a** advertisements in the middle of listening slow piano music or ballad songs, It ruins the whole damn mood man !!"
Best part of the app is very responsive and clean UI . English song collection and its recommendation is best in class .But till now bollywood and regional song collection is very low and hence for a bollywoods song lover prospective its didn't match my expectations.
"Too many ads..... Like 2-3 back to back ads ruin the experience, and i understand that you need money to continue but come on at this point you are just pushing to either get premium or extra buck into your pocket."
"The UI is nice but I'm switching to another app because it doesn't have adequate English songs. A lot of times, I searched for stuff that isn't available and was disappointed. Wish they had wider availability of music."
"Suggestion / Requirement/ Limitation - I want to suggest to Spotify that I have one problem with search music option that while searching song why should I write correct spelling of song , it is so irritating to write correct spelling of of every song because many song has same name but with different spelling. Why there is not an option for write any line from song to search the song. So it is request to Spotify to add this option."
New UI sucks i cant see most recent playlist i heard and whenever you play music it stops when my phone becomes idle after a few minutes. Great app but with a few issues. Please update app and fix bugs
"Its a good app for listening to music. But sometimes when I'm listening to it, it skips randomly. Sometimes its when I'm pressing certain buttons, or its just when i have the phone off. I have spotify premium if that helps anything. Please fix this as it is making me have a tantrum like a child."
"Please bring back alphabetically sorted artists in My Library. With the newest updates, everything in the library is now a jumbled mess and it takes forever to scroll through and find a particular artist. The new changes are not intuitive or helpful in the slightest."
They are starting to bring back the good features they had before the redesign but it still has long loading times. A step in the right direction though.
Fix it! Since the last update the widget has gone - why? The notification bar offline button has gone - why? Spotify itself keeps stopping after listening for about half an hour. It randomly stops and I have to go back onto Spotify to play again. WHY!? I had no complaints before. But now I have lots. Fix it! Thanks.
"Why did you get rid of the widget? It's so frustrating not having it anymore... Other than that, and that I wish there was more customisability and inbuilt lyrics, the app is great. Wish I could rate it higher..."
"Why Withdraw Widget? Why? Why? The widget is what made the app perfect. It allowed you to quickly access your music. Now they decide to remove it, making it less conevnient to listen. I'm very disappointed in you Spotify."
"Spotify itself is awesome. The app is great too however, I'm giving it 3 stars because they removed the widget option. That part sucks! It was so much easier to have the play/pause button on my home screen rather than going into the app itself. Please bring back the widget."
"(Premium version) App pros and cons only: |Pros| 1.Relatively easy navigation with a clean, dark interface. 2.Easy to search for new music and add to playlists. 3.Good connectivity to Spotify on other connected devices and with Shazam app. |Cons| 1.No music player widget anymore? (What is the actual point of removing it?) 2.Not straight forward to tell if downloaded music is saving to internal memory or sd card anymore (on Huawei anyway) 3.Download button abit too easy to swtich on my accident."
"Please fix the advertising bug. The advertisement doesn't disappear even when back button is pressed, the app is great, but this annoying bug is pathetic!!!"
Was much better before they changed the UI and set all saved music to just the one playlist. Was honestly a step backwards and was much more user friendly beforehand
"Its ok but annyoing. Ive had this app for years and it used to be my absolute favourite with ads coming in quite spaced out and only haveing 2-3 per ad break but now im getting the same ads over and over again between 4 songs and now having 5 ads play during the break. Even in the advert to get 30 mins free i have two ads play, its making the app so frustrating as it has increased massively the amount of adds given yet only give the same 4 ads for days on end."
"Why on earth would you take away the widget??? There's literally no reason to do so. And the fact that the UI got changed for no apparent reason also adds for confusion and frustration. I like spotify and think its great, but these changes aren't helping with anything but frustrating the user base."
"Two bugs: 1) When I forward or backwards within a given song, the volume is louder for a split second and then is more quiet again. This happens every fast forward or reverse, in any song. 2) When I go to settings, and hit EQ, it actives some random EQ filter, even though EQ is not activated. If I then activate a EQ filter, it of course changes then sound again. The point is, even opening the EQ settings changes the sound, even without activating any EQ."
"Used to be nice with a widget in main menu and a quick offline mode toggle, they've removed both features which is genuinly annoying considering they were integrated in the app already. Would leave at two starf if they hadn't added a sleep timer."
"Quite simply, I miss the widget and the easy access this gave me to the Spotify service. I have no real thoughts about the other changes people have commented on because basically my use of Spotify has declined since the widget has gone. As (hopefully) a little bit of constructive feedback for Spotify, since the widget has gone in have noticed I've gone from being quite a heavy user of Spotify to an occasional user. Making me consider if my premium subscription is necessary."
"good music streaming service, and I'm proud of you for standing up to Apple.  However, the ads for your own premium service absolutely ruin it.  I payed for over 6 months of premium, and decided it just wasn't worth it, so I cancelled my subscription.  Immediately flooded with ads telling me to just give it a try.  I did try.  How do ads for your own premium make you money?  Is it really that successful?  All it did was make me stop using the app."
"This is usually an awesome app-problem is the control widget. They keep removing it. I'm sure there's a reason, but it was working fine and made it easy to quick skip rather than pulling the screen down when the homepage is already open...."
love this app but with the updates lately the music stops playing randomly when screen turns off. also randomly stops playing but continues to play(no sound) and wont start playing (with sound) until i press the pause button and then press play again. really annoying since i do pay for the service.
"Was working perfectly until the latest update, it now crashes constantly and takes a while to load. They also removed the widgets and the UI is now unnecessarily complicated."
"Too big. Competes with Google's 50,000 built-in apps, and between their bloat and your size, I can't even take pictures. Sorry, but until your Lite version is available in the US, I gotta let you go."
"the new UI is awful, and is extremely difficult to navigate compared to the older UI in which you could just scroll through your saved artists in a list."
when i listen to music and turn my phone screen off the music will keep playing for a little while then stop but then if i press the home button or power button it goes again then if i turn it off again it just happens over again. also i have premium if that makes a difference
its a good app if you like to listen to music. kinda sucks that you have to pay for no ads but least its affordable. (need to make mula somehow).... but the one downside of the latest update is I lost my widget that i used while im in the car. the little player is gone =( i was able to access and play the songs without opening the app and going through to get my list i last played it was already on the widget waiting for me to push the play button...it also pauses songs for no reason...
"where's the ""offline mode"" button on the taskbar/toolbar? after updating again, there's no widgets for spotify anymore, so I can't access it from the home. I always click icon first. why there's always lack after updating this app? is it those widgets only for premium user? can you tell us why?"
"Used to be my go to music app, but the last few UI updates and the removal of the Android home screen widget has regressed this app dramatically. Very disappointing..."
"Welcome to India! Very good application; love the fact that native application is available for linux too. Sound quality is excellent.  Only gripe is limited collection of songs, specially older stuff.  Since the service has just launched in India, I'll wait for improvement in this area for 2-3 months before going out (I'll be greatly disappointed). All the best!   Edit: Even after about 5 months the situation has not improved. Have downgraded to free tier."
Always been more than happy with spotify...I use it at least 3 hours everyday...but what happens with the last update?? The spotify's widget on my experia xa2 it has disappeared from my home screen and cannot put it back!! It was the best way to interact quickly with the app...
"What are yall doing there? First I had to deal with the new update which stopped me from liking certain songs..... instead, I have to like the album...... I don't want to like the entire album.... just that one song... ya killing me smalls. Then you guys took my widget. That was quick access. Why you guys messing with me like this???? I love the app because I love my music, but this new update is hot garbage"
"The new UI is terrible. Spotify itself is awesome but for some reason with this recent update, I often have random stops in my music or just crashes for no reason at all. Also the widget I used to have on my android phone vanished from the options so I have to go into the Spotify app to skip a song."
Lots and lots of ads. Can't find download button to download songs and play them offline. Needs good speed of internet to play songs. Have many tracks but not easy to find the right track. I loved the UI. Hope the app gets better by the time.
"new update sux! been using spotify for years and loved it till yesterday. music pauses, skips, freezes, plus the widget I used daily is no longer available! wth...."
"Horrible interface, not intuitive at all. Buttons don't ever do what you'd expect, the most used actions are difficult to discover..."
"Well I used to really love Spotify then bang...an app update takes away the Widget. I used this all the time to quickly start playing music. The notification idea is terrible, who want to clutter their notification section any more than it already is. You need to rethink removing a great feature."
Spotify makes a lot of questionable changes in their UI and UX. I'm only writing this review because they just removed the spotify widget for android phones without offering a substitute. they say you can still use the notification pane but I dont want to. stop adding 5 second GIFs to the background of the songs and start giving us a better program to listen to music to. you dont even pay the artists that much for their music relative to what they could be making so what are you doing?
"Even though I love the convinience of the app, I liked the old UI much better and for some reason the home screen widget was removed in the latest version even though it was extremely useful."
New UI is terrible. Its super slow and i have a new phone. Show me my recently played. Where is it? I need it. Make it possible to lose the Podcasts section because i dont care about them. Make it easier to download every liked song by each artist because its too slow to load for some reason. Just go back to the old update. Its a mess.
"Although a great music streaming service with best designed playlists, I just faced one issue with this app. Sometimes, the advertisement just gets stuck on the screen and when I click on dismiss, the space behind the advertisement gets clicked, meaning that the advertisement just kinda acts like an overlay which I cannot remove but to restart the app. Kindly fix the bug."
"Saved songs no longer appear in the album tab, only the artist, which is a shame because the way albums is sorted makes jumping between songs/artists easier than using artists. Also seemed to start experiencing big bouts of lag in all aspects of the app in one of the recent updates. Also, also: i seemed to have lost a bunch of saved songs. Is this an issue for other folks, or the result of me unknowingly hitting the save/unsave button a bunch?"
"I lost my offline button on my phone. Furthermore, the player that should show up on my lockscreen or in the notifications bar is gone. I have to manually go to the app just to change or skip a song."
"Great overall service, but the app is genuinely one of the slowest, least responsive apps I've ever used. It doesn't matter how fast your hardware or network is, this app is ridiculously slow. But whatever. Beggars can't be choosers."
This update is a little messy. Songs randomly stop playing when the phone is locked. When I save a song to my liked songs it sometimes doesn't appear on the list and I have to unlike it and like it again. Anyway the redesign looks awesome.
Very limited music example no Linkin park yet devoleper please add more music that will be very helpful. Otherwise music quality is good.But if don't get my favourite songs than why i am gonna use this application. Please add all music in the world and do it quickly cause i love the global version but this version is trash now.
Some functionality issues on the lock screen. The UI is awkward and different in format on the desktop to mobile. Sometimes songs disappear.
"So I've used this app for quite a while. I had an older version for 9 months, saying that i was deployed and had zero time to update it. When i got back to the States, i realized that everything that i had loved about this app is now broken or just all together removed? What happened to the saying ""if it aint broke, dont touch it""?"
The latest UI update fixes things that were not at all broken. Can no longer just see my songs in my library. Way to go Spotify. Roll it back.
the app has been very helpful as i like to have some relaxing music playing while i sleep but a few days ago my account and everything I had saved was deleted. i dont know why and i have had to go back through and rebuild the one playlist that i had which consisted of almost sixty songs.
its ok. finding albums and playing complete albums is a challenge. user interface is not as intuitive as you may expect.
"I have no doubt about the awesomeness of this app. But I am wondering why it seemingly, suddenly requires, by far, the most (1.05gb) storage on my device? I have my suspicions and will keep a close eye on it. Reserving 5 stars for when the ""mystery"" is hopefully, positively solved."
"Constant arbitrary changes to the UI, and everything is buried in some obscure menu. Usability is at an all time low. To Spotify: write a better changelog than, ""We're always changing the app, keep it updated"". Also, the name of the app was changed to ""FIND MUSIC AND PODCASTS ALL IN ONE PLACE"" - whoever thought that was a good idea should be skidded immediately."
Wish Oneplus could access the equilizer. Also the new organization is whack. Can barely find anything in my library. Hope they make the organization similar to how it was before so you could just scroll through all the artists who's songs you've saved without having to follow all of them.
"It doesn't have some of the old hindi songs from 2000s era. also when I am listening songs with headphones plugged in, there is a little bit of delay when I pause the music with headphones' button. it also doesn't show the lyrics of songs. app starts to lag when connected to Chromecast. sound quality is a bit lower as compared to gaana app. (I'm sharing my experience from free version of both apps)."
"Love the app and the broad range of music/devices to play it on. Sometimes frustrating when devices don't sync what's playing. For another star, could you fix the scroll bar in long playlists so that it doesn't start by hovering over the 3 dot setting button? Many thanks in advance."
"Unintuitive UI, huge library yet misses some key bands and albums, shuffle/radio play is sometimes ok but sometimes misses the point entirely. Medicore platform for the masses that are not too obsessed with music, and just want to launch a premade list/radio without it being very specific or caring for quality (watch out - higher quality audio has to be specifically enabled). To end on a positive note remote control across devices is an awesome feature."
It is good to listen songs in spotify.It has smooth sound.I liked it. But the reason for 3 stars is because it wont pause the music when we press pause button.It takes a lag time of 2 - 3 seconds to pause/play. Initially I thought it was my device problem.But later on I realised that it wasn't. Kindly fix this bug.
"i understand having add popups while listening to music or podcasts, but can ya please move the ""dismiss"" button away from where it is? every time i try to hit dismiss it goes to the screen of what im playing and i cant select anything else unless i completely close out the app"
"spotify is all in all a great app for streaming and discovering new music! please put back the feature that in the top line of a playlist (even above the picture of the playlist) you could automatically search for songs in this actual playlist. ""find in playlist"" via the option button on top right is totally inconvenient :( fix pls"
"One the best music apps that I have used with a ranged variety of music. My issue is the changed features that have been made to only suit premium users, like the song radio and repeating tracks including the shuffle play and how it is designed to play songs restrictively. With some understanding to an extent but it seems as though once you start loving the app more and more features stop for free listening and move to premium."
"for whatever reason when the ad comes up to watch a short video for 30 min of ad free listening, the button is no longer available to watch the video....so frustrating"
I used to love this app but now they made the menus too complicated. I've been a premium member for 5 years now and the system was perfect until a few months ago they ruined it.
I love spotify. ive had it for a long time. but recently it's been pausing every 2 or 3 songs. i have to keep my screen opened. totally ruins the mood .‚òπ please fix
"a lot of questionable changes over the years. can't understand why they have to deliberately make Android's version so clunky an unintuitive and the Apple version so cryptic. I still use it because git's affordable, but the functions don't seem to be getting better. I liked it a lot better in 2017."
"I like it and all but it pauses in middle of songs when you dont hit it, it restart the song sometimes ,also it will quit playing the music for a little bit after ,the update."
"I think its cool and I do have a premium account. My only problem is I have yet to find a way in the app to view my account settings. I don't think the app is able to siscontinue my service which I find shady. Every other app doesn't require you to go to their website, it can be done from the app."
So I can search for my 10 playlists by typing in keywords easily but to search through the 1700 songs on a playlist I now need to go through a menu and look for it? why?Also why dont they show the number of songs on a playlist anymore? Been using Spotify for 5 or 6 years and had premium for like 4 but the last couple updates (while they made the UI a bit prettier) have made the app way more annoying to use... especially given the fact the apple and PC version of spotify still have those features
"If you want my money, stop letting your app blow up to 1 gig+ without my permission or any good reason. I can't believe they think people would pay for such a buggy program. I've been warning my older relatives not to use Spotify & will keep doing so until I find a better alternative or‚Äîunlikely‚Äîthey actually fix the problem. Other than this issue, it's just what I want. I can't believe they're so unprofessional as to let massive bugs ruin a good app."
"Nice app, but has the longest unskippable ads I have ever seen. Also there are unskippable songs quite often, while app asks to go premium. I'm going back to YouTube."
"overall, the music quality is very good. but one flaw is that after the update, it is quite difficult for me to find the songs that I downloaded, but did not 'like' it. for people wondering, subscribing to spotify is actually a great deal :)"
"great service, premium account for years. UI after last update terrible to use, its not immediate to use anymore. can see only recommend artists when i have lot of them downloaded, need a page where i can find a list with the artists that i have on my account, either downloaded or not."
"When Spotify first came to India, the app experience was snappy. Now, the play button or any other functionality lags in the order of seconds ocassionaly. Sometimes it took 15 seconds."
keep running into a bug where i can't dismiss an ad banner. my touches are registered as normal by the UI but the ad banner will be obstructing my view. only goes away if i close the app and clear it from RAM and then open it again.
the change to the library is ruining this. I have almost 4 GB of music I cannot access unless I follow the artist and even then unless you already had it in a playlist you have no way of going through songs you've already downloaded. i am seriously considering canceling my subscription unless they can fix this
"Good selection of music, but the app is buggy. Sometimes buttons are unresponsive, sometimes Bluetooth doesn't quite work, the interface in general could be more useful."
"Let me preface this by saying the spotify service itself is great. Every version of this app has some issue with UI loading times, freezing, playback bugs, songs randomly undownloading, and an abysmally slow download speed for songs. If the app worked right, I'd be really happy with this app, but this shows a complete lack of quality control! Spotify is a huge company with an equally huge android userbase. C'mon, Spotify. Get your s**t together."
Needs improvement in AI in terms understanding one's taste in music. So that the relevant playlists could be displayed in UI.
"Disappointing that they removed the recently played section. Its the best option for music streaming, but they make some stupid UI decisions sometimes."
"the new UI disable us to choose song for playstation, as how it used to be. The app play the preview of the song on the phone, rather than playing the song on the playstation. please fix it"
Every since the newest update I've had to put my music on shuffle every single time I open the app. It no longer stays the way I last left it. It's a minor inconvenience but it's starting to become quite irritating.
would be great if I can clear the queue with a single tap instead of manually selecting & removing. and the car mode for aux cable would be great too.
"As a premium user who uses their phone in landscape mode in the car, it sucks to have that feature removed. I also have an iPhone and can confirm it's gone from there too. Great library of music available to play, recent UI change raises my eyebrow to say the least but I will stay subbed for now."
The app is really cool and enjoy full but we need some ui interface change and some play list option trending option new hit songs and reveal to the india market for music lover . thank you. team please do as per our request.
"why there is so less song for India, can't even find Green Day and nothing!! but whatever songs are available are very good in quality. UI is perfect"
"I love Spotify, but two days ago, I am no longer able to stream Spotify on my google home or my smart TV, because spotify now requires a premium account for these features. Edit: spotify is playing again on goohle home. not sure what is going on. things coming this way?"
just purchased premium to avoid adds but now the 'favorite' and 'remove from list' buttons are gone from all the playlist screens making it harder to modify anything that would update the algorithm that discerns my likes and dislikes.
"Very easy and simple app to play songs. Good range of songs. Just a problem with the app- while unplugging the aux cable during a song for attending a phone call, we can neither hear the receiver's voice nor can the person hear our voice. Kindly fix this issue."
"The base service is brilliant, but the new update for the app has made everything less convinient to do (stuff like rather than a quick swipe down to search through saved songs, you now need to press 2 buttons to get to get to the search bar) + is super buggy, feels like a step backwards"
I love spotify but they've made stupid changes recently. 1) Why remove the songs tab? I want to option to shuffle all of my songs. Can't think of any reason why it got taken out. 2) 'Downloading' songs simply doesn't work any more. You download it but then it's impossible to actually get to the downloaded songs without going onto the artist page (which requires internet). 3) I used to have loads of artists saved in my library but the vast majority of them have just dissapeared?? Y u do this?
"Good but not as good as is could be... The shuffle play is atrocious, can have 200 songs and it'll play 10 in a row, not randomly. Also need the ability to remove and add a track from playlist with one button, not multiple presses. Simple stuff but not thought of."
"It's a good app with a good library, but it's UI is a bit messy and the social aspect is terrible, you can't change your username, control who follows you and the mobile app has no form of interaction with friends by knowing what they're listening, but the desktop has. It's basically useless to have some sort of social networking effort as poor as that."
"Spotify is a great service and this could EASILY have been a five-star app. But they have sabotaged it in so many ways. Hostility towards privacy: private sessions auto-terminate with no warning. A deliberate strategy to inhibit copy-and-paste not only on mobile but even on desktop and on their website. Barely any song credits (they won't even tell you the year). And finally, confusing menus with no systematic way to move between various views. A lot of programming talent negated by poor design decisions. I signed up for a paid account then canceled it after I discovered their anti-privacy stance and hostility towards copy-and-paste."
"Been a big fan of Spotify ever since I first got it, but in the last couple of updates the search bar has become less and less accessible which is a real inconvenience. It was nice and practical when you just had to scroll up slightly to expose the search bar and then quickly find the song/artist/album wanted. Now have to go through option button which adds two (avoidable!) clicks. Other than this I quite like the last update which gives a cleaned up face to my library."
"spotify is the one, just the app let's it down, not the quickest or cleanest. songs stopping mid track, won't load anything I have to close then reopen the app"
"Nice app but i how i wish u could only listen to music i only added on my playlist, and not songs you added. Hope there will be different playlists or buttons for new songs, trending, most played etc of categories."
"the App just suddenly stops, freezes. initially i thought it was just the settings on my phone. Went to see recent reviews and it wasn't only me who's experiencing the issue. I have been experiencing this since last week. any quick fix?"
Switch back to the previous version of the library UI. This new one is confusing and I can't get to the artists I actively listen to. It really didn't need to be changed.
What happened?? Who's bright idea was it to put the Artist tab in NOT alphabetical order? It takes me way longer to find the artist I want to listen to because there's no order to it and I end up having to use the search button.
The new update ruined the user experience and makes it harder to find your music. I reverted back to the older version.
"i love your app, but please go back to normal...i pick a song and it takes my songs off shuffle. i cant see artists i have music for unless i follow them. please go back, it has ultimately upset me. it used to be so easy to navigate and find all my songs so quickly. now it wont even shuffle everytime i pick a song"
"Nowadays in the notification panel the button ""offline mode -online mode "" it doesn't work. Thats why I I put 3 stars, generally the application is perfect . PLEASE FIX IT I AM WAITING."
"the app display freezes with the spotify premium poster during usage. if i try to tap the icons in the bg, it works but the fg is still the poster that I cant skip or do anything. is this your evil design to promote premium or just a bug?"
"Not the biggest fan if the new interface, its a really big change and doesnt feel as intuitive. FYI- for those looking for a section with all songs look for the 'liked songs' tile and you'll be able to shuffle all your songs there."
It would be five stars if they would just fix the play button on the lock screen. for whatever reason when you hit play/pause on the lock screen when listening to podcasts it skips forward. Otherwise a great app JUST FIX THE PLAY BUTTON
"Spotify was a 5 star app for me until the new UI with update 8.5.10.774. Prior to this update everything was wasy to navigate and find. Now it is the complete opposite. The Podcasts tab is a mess, songs had been shoved into my playlists, and my artists are now all out of alphabetical order and there is no filter to put them in order. i usually don't bother reviewing stuff but the app was fine before this and now its frustrating to navigate so I'm doing this in hopes it results in an update"
"Digging the look of the new Library UI. It has significantly worse performance than the rest of the app on the S8 though, taking about 5-7 secs to load an album detail. That's rough. Seems like just using Search instead of my Library is more effective in its current state."
"i used to like it a lot, but then the player changed in an update and now in the recent one they've ruined the my music section. awful ui, removed sections and took out the letters in the sidebar that helped with searching artist's in albums. keeps glitching too and showing blank screens. also took away the easy to use tile for switching between offline and online, now i have to go into settings"
"The overall design is very clean and pleasant, though I've consistently had problems with how slow the app is. Sometimes my Library doesn't load or songs have been removed from my downloads. It's been updated numerous times but nothing has fixed how slow it is on my LG G7 ThinQ"
Pushes loads of ads wanting you to subscribe. Sound hiccups on freebie feed.... sort of makes you think twice subscribing if file continuity is disrupted whilst listening... would really like to become a subscriber but the hiccups are holding me off... sensational otherwise! Colby.
"slightly disappointed at the moment. The best feature for me was the offline mode quick toggle, which has since disappeared. on top of this i am a student so im paying for students premium however i was not told that you need to renue it yearly so i was charged full price for two months. in addition the process to renue it was difficult and took 4 or 5 attempts for it to work. hopefully my initial point gets fixed sooner rather than later."
Edit:- The song collection in India is not good. The first day I got the annual plan but after a while I can't use it because many songs are unavailable. I tried YouTube music meanwhile and it is great and recommendeations are also very nice. It's UI is really easy to use as it should be and streaming quality is great. One thing I'd request is option to clear the queued songs and keep playing current one.
"the album filters button does not work. Since the UI was updated I've tried and it doesn't work, I've even reinstalled it THREE times!!! pls fix it for 5 STARS."
use Spotify all the time at home or in the car BUT it doesn't understand Classical Music. No I don't want to shuffle songs from Deruffle's Requiem! Come on Spotify... you can do better!
"Premium user: After the recent UI update, shuffle disables itself automatically if you manually select a song from the Liked songs category. This is quite annoying. The shuffle setting should retain the user preference (on/off) regardless of track selected. With premium I expect better. Literally last week Spotify had this work fine. With this new UI update they went backwards. The UI isn't that great either, still isn't as intuitive as UIs can be in 2019"
"i love Spotify however they have just removed my favourite feature, i use a razor phone and i used to have an offline button on the drop down menu and since this update it has disappeared, is there a way to put it back??"
"Used to love this app, but lately the app developers have transformed into a bunch of bloatware. They've made it difficult to customize. The UI is fair at best."
I really loved the app but the new your library interface totally ruins the experience for me. It was really convenient to see all artists in alphabetic order without having to search for them. Now I have to remember all the 50+ artists I listen to just to quickly find their songs.
Keep Screen ON! Please allow the option to keep the screen on. Nothing is more frustrating than having to fiddle around and unock my phone just to press the next button or heart a track while driving.
The wide library is amazing and the UI experience is also pretty neat but the app is slow and buggy. I've been using the app for more than 4 years with different phones and I can't recall a long period of time in which the app was stable.
"Any suddenly 192 songs in one of my playlist got deleted automatically , and now they are redownloading again. Come on Spotify , your Premium hasn't given me pleasure at all. Fix this issue quickly"
"Was loving Spotify until the update. Now it just keeps messing up, pausing songs halfway through even though they have been downloaded and/or i have perfect signal. Equally as annoying is that I will pick a song i want to listen to but it will scroll down and select another one instead.... Good job in ruining a great thing Spotify."
"It just works, so it's good. But it's not the best. Spotify has the smallest song library among the music streaming services (about 40m, while TIDAL has 60m, Deezer and Apple Music has around 50m) yet they still didn't bring any HiFi quality option, unlike TIDAL, Deezer, or even Soundcloud. Other than that, it still doesn't have JAY Z's songs and some other artists which is to me, a big downside. Now that they removed the Offline Mode toggle from quick settings, it got even more unlovable."
"This app had a very cool option in the last version, i dont know why did you remove it, now i can't find the ""offline mode click button"" on the quick settings on my notification bar, i really used this feature and now is gone. may you put it back?"
"Since the last update, the offline button in mi notification area has disappeared. A couple of updates back it just didn't work at all but still showed up."
"Quality of music provided by this app is good and pre-made playlist recommendations in app are good but it has got some issues. For example sometimes it's not adding songs to playlist even if I tap add button several times. Some popular songs aren't available in app currently. I hope they add them soon. You should improve app integration with genius app. So, that we could see lyrics without opening the genius app to see lyrics."
i couldn't play directly a random song from my playlist unless it is on top of the list. dissapointed. but the search engine is quite awesome coz almost evry song I've searched is there.
"good...by watching a video for interrupted music, u don't get 30min it promises üòà the adds are really undeserving of an app like this, it would be great but it ruins it quite a bit."
"Love the app but seem to have bug problems/glitches. When my phone screen is locked the music sometimes stops playing then will usually restart, or stop playing until I unlock or tap the screen. Have tried reinstalling still glitchy. It kinda ruins the experience. Using a Samsung Galaxy S10e."
Good app however it doesn't continue to play similar songs to the song I listened to despite having autoplay on It's quite aggravating to have to find another song to play when it should autoplay songs itself.
Everything good.From UI to song loading to audio quality. What is super bad is the lack of certain bands and songs of popular artists like ed sheeran in my region. Simply pathetic. Spotify needs to sort out these licensing problems as soon as possible. Why would I go premium when i am not getting access to full library?
"glitch with new update, I've been using sportify with almost no issues on mobile for like.. 8 years. After the last update, songs just randomly stop while playing and in order to resume playback I have to hit the next button. Super annoyed, please fix!"
cant download Particular song from an album..whole album has to be downloaded to save a particular Song or we shoulf make a playlist..crappy update!! Except for the clean UI...Jio saavn is better than this
"I really don't care for this app. It isn't the best and it isn't the worst. Just like everything else in the world. Who cares about a review anyway? It has plenty of options to choose from but they're never quite what I'm looking for. This app tries to be all it can be but fails miserably almost like everyday people fail at the same endeavor. If you want an app that reflects the misery of human existence in more ways than one, this is one app in a data sea of many."
"Offline Mode Shortcut in Quick Settings is missing after this update. I'm on a premium. I love that feature and its very useful to me specially when I have to use Spotify offline while my data is on. A quick toggle that saves my monthly bill. Now, I have to manually go to settings just to set this app on offline. Please bring it back thank you."
"I love this app, except for one thing. it auto plays over bluetooth every time i get in my vehicle. i cant find a way to stop it. i finslky had to uninstall. way to ruin a good thing."
"Usually when people search up a song and click on it, it automatically plays the song. But for me whenever I click on a song it always tells me i can only listen in shuffle mode with every song that i do, instead of just playing the one song that i wanna listen to. If anyone knows why I this is happening or how i can fix it please tell me. Ive also seen people saying that theres a shuffle button where you can switch it on and off, but i cant find that button anywhere. Btw i have an android."
"ive been using the app for a few months now but intermittenly. ive noticed there being no queue button at all. it took me quite a number of days to find this big flaw. and, i thought of updating it - to no success at all. Also am reading so many compaints, the company is dwindling down drastically and i hope the stock falls with such bad office etiquette with the improvements and new/important or basic services being pulled out of the world class app. God Bless Spotify globally. No Queue button"
"the App is having some strange changes on design and some changes in the way you see informations or have ""shortcuts"" to see the artists. other point I would fix is add an option to choose if you want to see the tumb of the song, or the video (personally I prefer seen the tumb of the album) The reproduction is good, nothing to say about that ;)"
"this service has been a boon to my commutes and my discovery of music! however, the interface is still way too clunky and fiddly to navigate quickly to learn more about a song or artist or album that is playing that I like."
Spotify has come a long way but with the cost of bandwidth skyrocketing I am deleting apps that require streaming to work. Until connectivity fees become less than obscene I will play the music I already have.
"Pretty good app overall, but the only thing that really does bother me (also the reason I'm writing this) is the new 0.99 offer add for 3 months; I get the idea, nice offer, might consider it, BUT - I can't dismiss it, close it or even press the find more button at times, it freezes the screen and won't let me acces anything else until I stop the music and close the app completely. Could you please do something about this bug? Might reconsider my rating of 3/5 after it's fixed. Thank you."
"Look even using this for free is nice, minus the ads, but im starting to get fed up with the fact that shuffle is ruining everything. I've been using this app for free for MONTHS now and have only heard about 40% of my entire playlist and have heard the same 30 songs out of hundreds play every day multiple times a day. please fix this or at least let me click on the songs i want to play rarher than using the useless shuffle mode. if there is some way to change the settings please let me know."
"Decent app at first, but it now pauses every few seconds if phone is sleeping. if I double tap screen or push volume buttons, it comes back but only to pause again. Spotify....any fixes??"
"It's good if you're not much of a music head like that. It has most songs, not all which is hard to believe at this point in time. The search & UI could use a revamp. Other then that, it's pretty good. I use it everyday"
"I really like the Spotify app, the UI (User Interface) and regular updates üïí makes this music app üé∂ even better. But there is one ‚òùüèº downfall too! This app mainly focuses üéØ onto the labaled music üéß but in India üáÆüá≥ underground music üß¢ is also popular. That's why I gave you only ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê."
"The music quality and stuff over the app is quite cool, no doubt over that but you guys have so annoying ads. Come on guys, no other streaming service contains this many frequency of ads. Further, you guys have ads regarding interruption in music, lol. These many ads have forced me to listen to other streaming services. Hope the frequency gets reduced and becomes some what equal to saavn and all. Thanks."
Good app. Could be better if you could rewind Daily mix when screen is locked. This feature only works for my playlists. The loud music warning needs to be disabled as it is dangerous when driving since you need to look for the tiny OK button. Maybe have a driving mode or loud music profile where loud music is enabled.
"I have been using this app for a while and then the music I really enjoyed disappeared, I was told it was against guidelines, but the music was on here for like ever and now its gone I am going to stop using this app unless my music comes back, all of Blood On The Dance Floors, old stuff."
"Service itself is fine but when Chromecasting, its quite buggy. Stalls at the end of ads, and seems to lose connection with the phone app, not letting me skip or change playlists"
"There is loop, if you tap to go bac while playing, an ad pops up, you tap dismiss and it goes back to currently playing menu/ui, so you cannot change the media playing"
"First off it's way better than pandora,but if the premium was less you could really compete with apple music. One issue is the shuffle play, I have big playlists and want them to be truly random to be surprised by what it plays.Not the same order of songs every time I play one playlist, its annoying and ruins the song.The one feature where you could move the songs around manually you removed.if you fix these its try a five star app."
"It stops in between playing songs, although the play button is shown. Very stuck at some time. But a very good app if it didn't stop while playing songs. üòê"
It was good and all but I just hope you'll give us the real full lyrics WITHOUT THE INFO andd a timer button so the app will shut itself off or the song would stop playing. Very basic features. Pls
"Hello Spotify, First I wanna say the App is great, but there's a little feature that has me ,well pretty much sleepless, is the fact that before an Update for like 2 or 3 months ago, the damm thing won't go on to landscape mode while in play mode,what's up with that? Guys come on, I mean, we pay for a service and for what I've read we're like 99% of the users that are not happy with this...so please get new programmers to get that resolved as quickly as possible because the ones you have suck..."
Like and dislike button should be permanent. Also why am i getting songs of the language which i have not selected? also the best of artist never changes! this is frustrating.
startup is slow. fix that that. doesn't load my offline listening or my stuff quick at all. fix that. 2 problems which is why they are missing 2 stars.
"Coming off Google Play Music, I'm disappointed in the app. Needs better offline features. When offline mode is enabled, Artists that I have downloaded albums of should be highlighted. On Google Play Music, downloaded artists would be visible. Also you need to bring back downloads to external SD card. If not, I'm taking my business elsewhere. The app is beautiful and the GUI is incredible but these things need updating!"
"The app is designed with features that make life worse... there's no reason you shouldn't be able to listen to a single song on its own, and yet... No problems with podcasts, though..."
"It was perfect at the beginning but is now quite laggy and slow after the last few updates, it also will switch off randomly which can be quite annoying, which is a shame as the is the maon app I use for music"
"I would have given them 5 stars before, but they removed the ability to sort your playlists and appear to be making the ui more difficult to navigate."
"Good app, however would like it to be available as a default music app- trying to change songs with small notification buttons is fiddly and not safe when driving. Please fix this"
The skip song button is greyed out for samsung s8 when out of the app.. I have to resort to pressing the lock screen button and pressing skip on the lock screen and then unlocking my phone again.
"I enjoy, the adds sucks for those who can't pay due to country they live in, so many adds is just ridiculous, sometimes 5 in a row, uninterrupted music was a norm , now every company becomes a sell out, Soundcloud is just a far away memory to the world, who will follow. find another way to recruit clients, adds is a sure way to lose them. I mean the 6 skips per hour is innovative thinking, find these ways, but don't destroy music and vibes with adds, nobody is even interested in these adds."
Recently Spotify released its version for the Indian Market. The UI is amazing and the sound quality is great but the reason I am writing this review is that there are certain artists whose songs are missing. These are all worldwide popular artists. Kindly have a look at this issue.
"This latest update has made the spotify icon an eyesore on my homepage. The black border around the icon is terrible and just really bad UX. The fact that someone actually looked at that and said ""yeah that looks great"" is quite worrysome for the future of this product. I've been a spotify premium user since about 2015 and should the rest of the product go in this direction as well, I may have to find another service to give my money to. As of right now though, the app itself works great!"
"Im using a Poco F1 and i get bugs. when the premium ads showing a picture banner with 'Start Trial' and 'Dismiss' button pops in, there are so many cases where i cant 'Dismiss' it. the touches would register for the UI below the banner but the ads banner blocks it, so I woukd have to close the app and reopen agsin which gets so annoying. this hapened so many times. please fix it."
"great app especially for when you want to listen to a certain kind of music, but getting 4 ads in a row often is quite annoying and discover weekly has been giving me songs ive already listen to for a while."
I find Spotify one of the better radio/music apps .It would have gotten five-stars if they had a better troubleshooting system like being able to talk to a real person Some problems cannot be solved through email or they're quick answer section THIS IS Very Frustrating.
"I give 3 stars because Spotify app has a very annoying tendency to forget downloaded songs/podcasts. I spend a lot of my time offline and that is why I pre-download interesting music and podcasts, so when I notice Spotify can't find those items it is extremely annoying. It then requires an online connection to check on itself and it remember them again.   Without this bug I would give 4-5 stars."
"Release radar and suggestions are great additions app works well mostly for me. However the faux shuffling of playlists gets annoying after a while, it will never truly play things randomly meaning things get repetitively easily. Even with a premium membership things are played in they're preset shuffle order. Would otherwise be a great app if they could fix this."
"I'm a fan. I'm giving a temporary low score as a means to report a bug. I am in Ireland, my profile says I am in Ireland, I have not been traveling and I do not have premium on this specific account. I switched phones and when I log in, I get told I cannot use Spotify abroad for more than 14 days and get logged out again. I tried cleaning the app cache and trying again, that did not help. I will be grateful if you can provide guidance. Thank you."
"I'm going to be honest. I was so happy for the new android update (one ui, only available for Samsung galaxy s9 and up) because it was suppose to make apps easier to use however it has totally ruined spotify for me. I have been using spotify for the past 3 years and this new update has ruined my library and where it used to show my recently listened to now only shows albums I have downloaded so if I've listened to something recently and I want to know what it is well good luck."
"The app itself is a pleasure to use, especially as a Spotify Premium customer. But the new logo after the most recent update is HIDEOUS!!! There was absolutely nothing wrong with the old logo, but they just had to change it! It looks horrendous, and I personally think they should just change it back because it's quite an eye sore."
why does the new update not allow you to skip or pause songs when your phone is locked? i used to be able to skip and pause/play by pressing the buttons on my wireless headphones but now it wont allow me to
"Usually Spotify is pretty good, but since the last update it stops randomly until I unlock my phone and push the play button again. If this doesn't get fixed soon, I'm definitely cancelling my subscription."
"Its okay, counter intuitive controls and fewer songs than Google play music, and playlists are samey, but with Google play music going away its the next best thing."
"I love Spotify, but not so much on Android. somehow this is just much easier to use on my iPad. android UI is especially bad in Offline mode. the home scren doesnt show your offline playlists."
"well i really love this app for the reason that it's not just a music library. it's intuitive, n plays around. I'm only annoyed that at least the sleep binaural music that i play sometimes at night didn't have any ads. im an ad man n i get why a ads but I'll not when I'm trying to sleep. the name says sleep, it's so easy to work around. n i may have paid for it, but this ad in my sleep just drove me not to."
Not a fan of the button placement for casting to another device. It was fine in the middle where it was. Also having to press on the band name to go to there page isn't the best. Again getting a little list to go to that particular album etc was much better. Please take on board
"Good app overall. Some minor nuances prevent this app from surpassing other streaming apps in terms of overall UI. An example would be directly adding songs to a playlist during playback (Desktop). The option for different themes would be nice, such as green-white, for instance. No major complaints."
I really like the music selection but the app has issues. It seems that once it has run for a while the screen will get locked on ads. I quit using it for a while because of a similar problem before. It just gets really annoying. Please fix this.
android pie seems to have issues with the buttons working on the lock screen when playing music. have to reinstall the app every time to get them to work
"The app is great and all, but recent updates appear to have introduced issues around controlling the app via bluetooth & the lock screen when the phone is locked, and the widget when the phone isn't locked. 09/04/19 update - latest update is definitely an improvement on this issue, but still requires more work"
User experience design is really bad.. I like Spotify library but it seems others like anghamy lay out the app in a much user friendly way.. Example your menu to access anything about a song is way up on the right of the screen.. Where it should be at the bottom closer to the play and stop buttons. It's very inconvenient. I cannot manipulate my Playlists adding as song or removing a song except if I go way up the screen to access the menu. Also I can't reorder and sort Playlists from app.
Awesome app with perfect playlists and recommendations and UI. Totally worth buying it if you're into music but Indian version has a lot less artists. Led Zeppelin and Coldplay are not available in India. Such a deal breaker. Otherwise it would've been 5 stars. Also there are a little lags and app crashes recently.
"Great music service but Daily Mixes are not working - I switched from Deezer because Spotify in general has more functionality and a larger community. When I first started on Spotify I really enjoyed the daily mixes as a way to discover new music. However, recently the Daily mixes are always the same and no longer load new music at the end of the playlist (also the heart and dislike buttons are gone). Essentially they have become 5 unchanging normal playlists. Samsung galaxy s9"
the bar that normally shows up to skip songs outside the app no longer shows. Very inconvenient when your headphones don't have a skip button.
"I like the design and how many songs are in this app but what I don't like is that how other songs that I didn't add to my playlist play. It pissed me off a little bit. I don't know if I'm the only one having this, but please fix it. And please make it so that the user can just click on the song and it just starts playing, and also make it so that the user can pick either to shuffle, play in order, etc."
The interface and UI is mediocre. It would be better if the interface and UI is same as that of other countries' Spotify app.
"Spotify needs to work on making more music available I know, all the lawsuits and controversies crippling you..but India loves spotify and that is going to change soon if nothing is done. I am literally waiting to get the premium service but can do that is half of my favourite songs are missing. All the best, hope you'll figure this out soon :)"
"The UI looked really good in the past, I don't know why it's been changed in the latest update. It makes the app feel more generic and doesn't live up to the clean, Spotify experience"
"I've been using the app on my mobile and on my laptop for years with the Premium paid mode. On my mobile it works great, not so well on my laptop, though. It keeps popping up when I turn on my computer, even though I have selected for it not to do that. It keeps making my computer crash. It keeps changing my offline playlists to online and then I have to download everything again. It's becoming a nuisance!"
I would give it more stars but for some reason the search button and the albums you recommend doesn't always work it says something has gone wrong. So I delete the app install log in and then works for abit. You need to fix this I'm using huawei p10 on bt mobile
"I love the UI and the beautiful simplicity of Spotify, but there are limited options and features. The web player is not good, as it is often unreliable and loads terribly slow. This is especially apparent when the tab has been open for a while"
"There's a bug after update 03/04/2019, When the popup of ""premium"" comes in and stick to the UI after 30 second, I cant redirect to previous page as after clicking ""dismiss"", it send me back to current song page. Steps to replicate: 1. Play any song from any playlist. 2. wait for ad to come, run for 30 seconds and then see it stick to screen. 3. click ""dismiss"" on the ad 4. redirect to Current Song page, navigate back, you'll see the same ad and here, it blocks the navigation. [Tester]"
Like Spotify for content and ease of use. It has not been woeking on my cell and is not still. Spotify responds in a reasonable time but could be quicker.
"Now sort of finally works with BMW ConnectedDrive but taken some time. Some components don't work, but suspect that's more on the BMW side than Spotify. I feel there seems to be a fractious, rather than collaborative relationship between the two. And BMW development is remarkably slow. So connectivity is still a little hit and miss and Spotify does have a few quirks but it does work nowt."
love the app and all but I miss the swiping function. facing some issues with queuing songs as it'll just remove the 2 next songs after I drag another into the queue list. do fix it.
"its cool, but in SERIOUS need of a shuffle option... thats how i like to listen to my music but now i just have to listen to my playlist in the same order and it quite frankly gets annoying and also boring... its just the mobile app that dosent have this, the computer veirson does though, and its great. Other than that its one of the best music apps ive ever used."
"Spotify is great on PC, but for some reason you've decided to ruin the free version Android. I'm willing to see ads to support your platform, so why must you remove basic features? Is it too much to ask that I be able to listen to an album in track order?"
I really love the interface and ui but i believe it can better and more interactive. There are many very popular and trending which aren't there on the app which makes me go back to YouTube or apple music for listening to the same. Addition of song lyrics will enhance the user experience alot.
"For some odd reason no matter how good my mobile data is, I can't connect to spotify. I pay for premium so this is quite frustrating. Please look into it so I don't feel like I'm being ripped off."
"Excellent selection of music‚Ä¶ but way to many commercials and such basic functions as replay and playing a playlist WITHOUT shuffling, are blocked in the free version. There are a number of such products in the store that do not require going to paid mode/version. Oh, I connected the app to waze but don't see the benefit of linking to waze (a wonderful FREE app) as opposed to just using both apps individually."
There really needs to be a way to reset your listening recommendations. Just because I listen to classical guitar when I go to bed doesn't mean it's all I want recommended to me
"overall a decent experience with some quite annoying ""features"". Can no longer download Daily Mixes, makes it very difficult to add bulk songs to playlists. Waiying for something better to coke along, Spotify will do til then"
The UI is friendly. But the app freezes when I pause the music or try to increase the volume when playing music.
Very Nice Music App. The problem is that In the trial version every song had a heart symbol besides the title. It was easy and quick to select the favourite playlist. In the subscriber version (the paid version) the heart symbol is not besides the songs' title where by which it is made tougher by having to use 2 3 more steps to create favourites. Why So?
"whenever i search for a song to add to my playlist and try to add it with that add button on the right, it doesnt get add. also whenever i go to any artist album to add a song and click the add button, it goes to the home page. then agai i have to open that particular artist's album and again add it. please fix these issues Spotify team."
Guys I'm really missing the shuffle button here!!!! in really impressed with the collection and the sound output! but there are small changes expected soon in the UI!
The app UI is great and the curated random playlist is awesome but there are some flaws in the app as... 1. They don't have popular songs of bands like linkin park and twenty one pilots. 2. Their widget on lock screen doesn't work and I have to unlock the phone in order to change the song!!!!
"I really like the app what I don't like is the CONSTANT ADS TO GET SPOTIFY PREMIUM, like I can't afford it and when I'm getting ready and into a song once its over. BAM ad. ruins everything"
"Would give more than 3 stars but they eliminated the find in playlist scroll-up function ONLY ON ANDROID DEVICES. Plus, apple devices got that quick add to queue and delete from playlist by scrolling left/right function. It sucks very much when developers keep their apps that different between operative systems."
My previous experience on the older updates were very good. However recently especially when I just changed to S10+ the app has been acting crazy when my screen if off. The lockscreen play and pause buttons don't work (even on my S9). I can never listen to the full song peacefully when the screen is off. Pls rectify this. Make our premium purchase be worthwhile..
"terrible UI. not easy to filter or search playlists. used to take 2 presses, now takes 4 and some scrolling. needs a complete overhaul for easy use."
"Spotify is the best Global music streaming, but I dont know why most of the songs of my Favourite Artists arent playable!! Maybe it is a Spotify India only issue, which still requires fixing!!"
"i dont know how it works,but quite a number of songs i liked and saved simply become unplayable,as if they dissappeared from spotify data. very disappointing."
"I enjoy using Spotify, but since the last updates I cannot change songs using car buttons or phone controls. Also, it seems to shut down a lot when I am using headphones. This problem wasn't there prior to the update."
They keep ruining a good app with their ambiguous updates. Why did you remove the search bar from the top of each playlist! now it's a three step job!
"It's good. A better version of your app. I hope you put the ""don't like this artist"" or ""don't like this song feature"" in premium. Why do you keep changing the ui? It's fine the way it is. Stop changing it again and again."
"great content, nice app, but not so good UX it becomes very difficult to select your choice of track from the playlist playing and also it doesn't support shuffle feature in every scenario like ( mix, albums, etc) it only supports during favourite playlist section. and also thumbnails of albums created by spotify is not appealing and in some cases the relevance of the album (created by spotify)thumbnail of the album also created by spotify with the content inside the album is very low, etc."
"whilst I love your app overall and what you offer, it works sooo poorly on my Galaxy S9. can't change music on the home screen, the buttons just won't work and it also freezes a lot. please fix this!"
"Good service and a decent app, but the navigation is horrible. Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit, but I'm simply annoyed that core features like your playlists take more than 1 click to get to + offline playlist won't show directly when you have a crappy internet connection, the interface waits for all playlist to load and update or so... the lockscreen buttons don't work consistently either on my new Samsung s10. From such a big company, you should expect better. (No discounts for old users bytheway)"
"I normally love this app, but something happened recently. I cant pause/skip music if it's on my lockscreen. I cant even use the buttons on my headphones that allow this. Trying to find help via their website is a whole other level of hell, so be warned about that."
"Never had a problem until the last update. Now the menu no longer work on lock screen or with car stereo buttons, and the music will stop playing randomly/app seems to reset for no reason. I'm a premium user, but we'll see how long that lasts..."
"Have been using Spotify Premium for years without issue. Latest update has caused serious problems with the app, UI and bluetooth in particular. Music constantly cutting out, controls not working randomly. Very disappointing after years of solid service!"
"Was a very good app until I found out today that share button didn't work. I tapped on the share button and it just made me exit the app, tried reinstalling and reopening multiple times and same thing happened. I hope you can fix it as I want to share some playlists which Spotify features."
"I keep experiencing interruptions, the play/pause buttons tend to be unresponsive especially on the lock screen shortcut. I am using Spotify on a Samsung S9+ and I have yet to experience any performance issues outside Spotify when it comes to my device."
Issue with bluetooth connection recently. After the last update I can no longer use my forward button in the car to change songs.
review for new version- I HATE IT NOW!!!YOU SPOILT MY FAVOURITE!! the previous interface was much better!! I want to listen to musing based on my choice!!!!!!!!!!!! review for period version- Best Audio Streaming This has always been my favourite Audio Streaming Platform. with amazing interface as well as mind blowing audio quality. it is incompatible. but.....ppllleeaaaseee bring back the repeat button ..I beg Please!! I hate the new interface!!!!@!
"This most recent update (March 7th, 2019) messed the app up quite a bit. Although I still have all my songs, my 'Artists' tab only displays two names and my 'Albums' tab only displays 6 albums... Which doesn't make sense considering I have 1300 songs. I'd much rather not have to search through all my songs to find an artist. Please get this fixed."
"Spotify premium was great until I updated it on my Android device. Now it crashes about 17 times a day, and I'm unable to change the volume, pause or skip songs unless I am physically in the app. The bug has rendered my steering wheel controls and stereo buttons completely useless in my car. What is the point of having Spotify Premium if i can't skip songs? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è PLEASE FIX IT."
"Lot of artists are missing, so please do add them quickly!!! Since you guys came to India after a long time please do make it possible to either use UPI via Google Pay or make the RuPay cards viable for payment. I love Spotify and I've been waiting for this app for many years so please do take care of the mentioned problems. Otherwose kudos to you guys :)"
No support for Bluetooth audio devices: My pause and next button are not working with Spotify. Would ask Spotify to fix this bug at the earliest. Auto force close: Auto Force Close. If the music is paused more than once due to any sound from other applications the app crashes. This is very irritating while I am using applications like instagram or even whatsapp stories parallely.
"Not bad music player, but not the best I've used. This is one of the most popular, but the competitors have overtaking them for functionality and intuitive music taste learning. it can be very slow to open and also says there is no internet connection when there is. means frequent killing the app and restarting, which is poor from a paid app."
Ever since the latest update the app has been randomly stopping songs in the middle of them playing. The lockscreen music controller also randomly stops working. Please can you look into these bugs. Samsung S9+ OneUI
"i absolutely adore it, and i personally think the ads situation is completely fair, but when i have playlists/make playlists it always recommends stuff, and i wish i could figure out how to turn the nuisance off."
"This is one of the best music streaming apps out there no doubt. But simple functionalities like a loop or shuffle button is missing in the play menu and it is really weird since they are fundamental functionalities, also due to some back end problems I believe many indie musicians tracks aren't available.. Overall the algorithm for the customized playlist is amazing but I would love to see these issues get fixed ASAP"
Great ui. Very fluid(buttery smooth). Good collection of songs. Wish it could play device songs in offline mod. Also wish it could add songs from small artists like Renee Dominique(yes it has some but want more).
Hi Spotify team love the app for sure having trouble with it currently since Samsung released UI Pie update about a week ago and now having trouble when using in the car via Bluetooth can't skip tracks or when just playing it stops or just crashes over and over. Spotify team are you guys releasing an update to resolve this issue loved it when it worked in the car but since the system update that Samsung released ui pie it became very glitchy.
"Drains battery quickly and misses incredibly basic features in an attempt to get you to buy premium. It's not bad per se, but if it didn't allow me to remotely control it's browser equivalent I would've deleted it in a heartbeat."
I love Spotify however the most recent update ruined the library/saved feature and now it only shows preferred artists. The saved items don't appear when you click the artist the whole artist page appears.
"the app is pretty good overall, but there are a LOT of albums and artists that are unavailable on spotify, but I'm able to find them and listen in competing music streaming services available here in India. im hoping this is temporary and that the library will be expanded quickly. ill be forced to move back to other services, if this doesn't get rectified."
"Rather disappointed in this app. I was expecting to hear a decent selection of artists when listening to a generic genra radio channel, but it just seems to play the same stuff over and over. I was also quite surprised at the poor sound quality for a paid account (and yes, I turned off spotify's equalizer)."
"Music is streaming but UI crashes while music still keeps playing. Needs optimization. Given its Android, won't see it too soon. Podcasts work fine at least."
"The user experience is unexpectedly bad. unlike the desktop app we can not play any song seamlessly . The number of skips is also restricted to 6 per hour. We can not go back to the previous song. The most annoying aprt is the short play thing, when i click any song i expect it to start from the start not from any random timeframe."
"The good thing is that Spotify's library includes the songs of all the artists who upload covers, remixes, 8ds of d originals on YouTube. The con is that d regional music library needs to be updated and some songs are actually in d app but greyed out hence cannot be played‚òπÔ∏è. Finally if I search for a song,artist or album it shows no result inside d app but if I add the word ""spotify"" & search it in google i get d link to ur site which redirects me into d app showing me d required result."
"the app is good but there are lots of drawbacks too. the main, when u close the app, the song stops playing.. That's a huge drawback for me. And when u turn off behind the lyrics, it still shows it instead of showing the lyrics of the song. the ui of the app is clean. its user friendly. and it should be made downloads free tooüòÅ"
"The app itself is great with no clutter, but why would you remove something as important as lyric functionality? Also, people here are taking about shuffle play being always on, but I can't even find the shuffle button in my custom playlists. And btw, more than half of my playlist's songs are not yet available. Please add more functionality like the desktop website."
"Couldn't find replay/repeat button, streaming quality seems to be good even without paid subscription.. But it's not very useful for me because the app doesn't have reply /repeat button."
Design is great. I can understand the problem with getting more songs licensed but not having option to shuffle or reorder playlists is just very sad.
"Great service with great connectivity! I'd like to see a refresh with the UI of the app, maybe some theme options, a refresh of the widget, and more widget options."
"App works terribly on my Nokia 8. Every time I start it up, there's a 50% chance it will completely freeze my phone for a few minutes then cause it to reboot. It's a pity - this has become more of a nuissance than the adds. And I pay for the Premium so..."
"1. The option to group speakers (Sonos) not there for all speakers & some speakers don't appear at all in the web app even though they do on mob 2. Often claims to be playing on a certain speaker when it's not 3. Artist radio freezes on one track when another is actually playing. Also, why can't I control Spotify volume with my phone buttons if not in the app, and why no option to stop screen sleeping when Spotify app on screen? Contacted support about these but they were worse than useless"
"I had Deezer, but I thought Spotify had more features. Deezer let me make multiple play lists and quickly find and play from them....Deezer made play lists easy and I can't find mine right on Spotify. Now, Spotify hasn't been working right on my phone for months...can't reach anyone. What I do like is they have a better selection....Easier to find non mainstream songs on Spotify. They need a better way to catogorize."
"every update a total change if the UI, when you start driving there's a horrible ""car style"" interface that's limiting you to stop or play songs."
"Great section of music, with good across-devices functionality. Still no ability to truly randomly play all songs, and queue list is unintuitive, with constant repeats of previously played albums. Would also like to see a ranking system. Downloaded songs are encrypted - they cannot be used outside the app - which is no use for when i want to use a song in a stage production (IMRO licenced venues)."
App plays music and podcasts well but sometimes the ad page gets stuck over the app and no matter what you hit it doesn't go away. You hit buttons behind the ad rather than the ad itself.
"It's good except for the fact that you can't skip a song from the play/pause button on your headphones. How is that not basic functionality? Also, why on Earth can't you view all songs by an artist. That's a silly miss"
"it's a good app however it isnt quite fluent for example you cant change the order of your playlists, you have to manually turn it into offline mode, there are no lyrics for songs just a genius biography on them and the shuffle needs improvement as it repeats songs too often."
"The app is great, but the addition of songs to your playlist and recommended songs are just a nuisance, and arent really helpful at all. However, the music quality is great and I like that I can play it in the background of whatever I'm doing."
it randomly pauses on the ps4 and on mobile. when I try playing music it stops like every two seconds. it was fine but this has been going on for a month. idk what it is but it really ruined my trust for this app
Spotify needs to have a stop button. It will play randomly even when paused. Very annoying. Also will not load the correct song title but will stay at the same one after like a hour of playing music. Other then that it's a great app.
it's good design and good selection of songs but a bit confusing. and it's hard to disable autoplay and suggested songs. generally meh. wouldn't recommend. go to pandora for an easier setup.
"Brilliant user experience, terrible at keeping songs downloaded. I lose interest in its use as soon as I have to redownload previously downloaded tracks."
"although the app has all the music you could ask for, why just on the phone out of ALL the tech in the world, do you need premium to have unlimited skips and choose any song, like i can even do that on my darn ps4, and a free 30 day trial requires my card details and then continues to pay afterwards? nahahah. tbh ima just use YT to listen to music."
Recent update killed my inline controls. Center button press on my akg earphones doesn't work after screen turned off for a while. But it works when its on. Ive tested another player and it works. Something with spotify tho.
The ui has always been lacking on this app. Some design choices they make make completely no sense (i.e. taking away the search bar in playlists). But they have music so I guess I can't complain
"i think the newest feautre is quite bad. i hate that it shuffles the song automatically and you cant choose the song you want and go on with the playlist, it just shuffles it and you cabt listen to it in order."
Good music app. but way too many long ads. it is alot quicker just to close and open the app than waiting through an ad.
Lot of headings for different playlists but they are blank and no way to access them or to give feedback in app. Also the share song button won't work
There are some problem with the application. Usually if I change to an other track on the playlist the music playing is stopping in spite of that the play button is on. Application restart does not help in these cases.
"Excellent app. Disappointed, however, that I can no longer search in my playlists. Quite irritating with large playlists."
"app constantly fights with the Google Home suite, widget never works or is constant with whats playing. algorithm gets repetitive. need to add a feature to block ft. artist."
"This is generally a good service and a decent app, but it periodically forgets I have an SD card to download onto, and auto transfers my entire library onto internal memory, taking over my phone. I fix it using the guidance on their forum (no official troubleshooting, just user advice), and the problem comes right back. It goes through repeated phases of this. Downloading so you don't have to stream on mobile data is the main draw of paying for premium, so if I can't do that, I'll just cancel."
"i love it! but i do have one problem,it takes FOREVER to load. i have this on chromebook, tablet, phone,laptop,pc, although i did know the chromebook wouldn't go so well. As a student,i use this almost everyday. studing, reading,doing homework,etc. Altogether, i would reccomend this to people that like to do stuff quietly..... .....unless you dont have headphones and you like to lisen to rock music. with that being said,keep up the good work!"
"i miss having the find option on the top of the playlist, i dont wanna keep having to press the button on the upper right side and then scroll down to just to press another button to the option of finding a song"
"Great service, but I can only give it a 3.  Why? Because this app must have to be the most infuriating app I've ever used.  First off, when I installed it I didn't subscribe to the service so within the list was the 'Favorites' section.  I'd spent hours finding great music and trying to build a nice favorites list.  Then I purchase the service and become a Paid subscriber, and whatta you know... like magic the only menu item that disappears is 'the favorites' section.  So now I've spent hours and hours liking lots of songs to make a nice list and now the favorites list is no longer there.  Everything else is there, just not the favorites.  Why on earth would the developers overlook this, especially after a user becomes a paid subscriber.  One would think they'd get more features but in this case we get less features.  Bizarre. Recommendation to the spotify... your developers of this app have made a huge oversight by eliminating the favorites list when a user becomes a paid subscriber.  Get it fixed and you'll get a 5, but I'm not the only one who is complaining about this, its very common.  Please fix it or I'll have no choice to cancel subscription."
Should be better. Awesome selection of music and clever suggestions but very slow in day-to-day use. Frequently has prolonged load times and sometimes the spinning circle will just keep spinning. There is clear requirement for optimisation of the app and the service.
"I use it all the time, but recently it has a different layout when I listen to the music. Instead of showing the song cover in a little box with the pause button under it, the song cover takes up the whole screen. I prefer the old one. (I have an Android.)"
difficult to setup a play list needs more intuitive methods of just chosing your bands and not trying to pull just anythinh and everything in the genre you looked for. but music isnt always so easy to identify so i get that. otherwise its ok. the ads of course suck
"A little glitch at times, song changes but title and screen graphics don't. Can't play all music. Music listening quality is good."
"Honestly horrible experience, I hate that it won't stop playing sugestive music that sound horrible. If you keep this up I will ruin this service and people will no longer use it. This might be out of rage, but this service needs improvements."
I love it except that when shuffling large playlists it seems to pick a small section of the playlist and only shuffle that. Which is frustrating after working for a while to build a large playlist
"The last ui update has made the app less usable, bloat has been added to the 'search' section which makes it slower to load or not load at all at times, this is a pretty crucial function for a streaming app and should not be bloated, there was no need to merge search and explore and it made search worse. Also please put the 'sort by' menu outside the top menu, it has become really inconvenient to use since it is mixed up with so many options."
"The app is alright, but recent UI changes in regards to how to filter and sort songs in a playlist are quite annoying."
Despite being awful to navigate it has a lot of good content now if the creators would only fix the confusing and looping UI it would be a decent app to find content on but as it is now it's almost impossible sometimes
Wish I could JUST see the lyrics and not always the awful music genius nonsense. Wish I could utilize playback buttons from my lockscreen and/or control center with android 9.0.
"Recently the Get Premium ad is always on the screen preventing me to touch any button in the app,except for the music title im currently listening. Also there are many times that there's a dead air in my playlist, and i have to re-open the app just for the next song to play, even tho I still have data to consume, the signal is fine and theres plenty of RAM in my phone. Its like the app intentionally do this for me to subscribe."
"Who thought it was a good idea to remove searching playlists, as well as sorting them? I've used Spotify since you could buy individual songs on it, so why ruin it for me?"
"Please fix this app. This is a great app, easy to use but there have been a few problems. As a premium member I am sometimes unable to access my pre downloaded playlist as i require access to Wi-Fi. Additionally sometimes the menu to access the ""add queue"" option also says that I must go online to see this menu."
"Newest update changed the ui for android auto, now while I'm trying to play songs while driving if I drop out of service it disconnects or tells me through spotify on android auto that there is no internet connection. Once this happens I can no longer skip songs or view the current song on my screen, and this is happening with downloaded playlists so this is extremely irritating."
"Good but crashes frequently. And please, please fix the click box of the remove download button. I keep accidentally removing my downloads when offline and it's very annoying."
"Very glitchy. Frequently starts playing music when starting other apps, UI not properly switching display from one song to another, and things not properly appearing favorited. The latter 2 can be fixed by going in and out of the app but I shouldn't have to. Spotify can do WAY better"
"was perfect before the update, now i have to tap through multiple menus just to search for a song in my playlist or filter it, its quite annoying, honestly."
"Queue management remains unintuitive. Continues to have the worst chromecast support of any app I use, dropping connection often and struggling to reconnect at odd times. Otherwise good app."
"When using Android, sound issues arise upon Lockscreen activation. Battery and performance settings had already been adjusted to not interfere and on the contrary even prioritize the app - but since the last couple of days it's gotten worse and the music stutters and lags quite often when the phone locks the screen. Just to be clear I'm taking about offline downloaded music playback, not online. There should be no reason whatsoever for the music to stutter or lag once lock screen is on."
There is an ad promt that asks you to click now for a 30 sec video and there is no no thanks button just a watch now button that no matter what you do it'll still play an ad even if you ignore it... that's the only thing that really makes me angry.
"Ads, ads, ads... Some ads is fine, too much ads is definitely unacceptable Sometimes they claim that they got some '30 second ads' which let us ENJOY 30 minutes of UNDISTURBED experience (which is actually 50 seconds because an ad before and an ad after). This seems nice cuz we can be sure we get 30 mins of UNDISTURBED music. However, theres a problem occuring because of this 30 sec ad. It happened many times already, I was playing music from a playlist/album and then when the 30 second advert appear, the ad didnt really play, which means im stuck there and the music player freezes, it was just showing that Im currently playing an ad which is 30 seconds long and its stuck at 0 seconds, unabling me to play the music after the ad. Ive tried pause and play, repeatedly, nothing happened. Ive tried tapping into another playlists/albums, nothing happened either. Ive even tried to re-launch the app, still, nothing happened. Then ill give up listening to music and do something else. Then the player would be fine the next time i go and listen music from Spotify which is usually a couple of hours later. We all know that theres premium account where there's no ads INTERRUPTING and we can even choose which song to listen and skip unlimited times, and its quite cheap, but we need some kind of credit card/paypal to pay for this feature. Im of course willing to pay for premium to GET RID OF THE ADS and enjoy other premium features. But I dont have credit card and Paypal, so, how am I gonna get premium? Spotify I just want you to fix the problem I mentioned before and also make the premium account more accessible for everyone. Please do something about this or at least give me a reply about this. For those who agree with me or had encountered the same problem pls upvote."
"I find Spotify quite good; however, I pay a subscription to this app and have asked on several occasions when I can expect to be able to arrange music by beats per minute (BPM). I am a dance teacher and BPM is extremely important to me. To date, this facility is still not available and it's becoming very frustrating."
"Writing this review is the only way I could find to submit a bug report. There should he an easier way..... In the latest update (Nov 8), the ""like"" and ""don't play this again"" buttons don't work when the song is full screen."
The only problem with this app is that the shuffle play button doesn't work. If you go into your saved songs and push shuffle it plays every song by the same artist. Until you skip through all their songs. It literally just goes down the list of songs doesn't actually shuffle anything
"Would be higher, however it doesn't allow people to edit their user name, it gives some random long a#* name even after typing one in(i made multiple accounts to test this), it won't allow people to delete an account, it doesn't allow people disconnect an account from Facebook, and it's genuinely frustrating sometimes(i personaly have to use the search function to look up a single song instead of the ""add songs"" in my playlists) other than that everything else is perfect and i will continue to use this app for it's wide range of easily accessible songs/artists"
Great app for music but I HATE HATE HATE that with the push of one button all my downloaded music is gone. Hit it a few times causing me to have to go the entire day without my music until I get home and download it all again. That one thing just ruins the entire experience for me and is why I cut my paid subscription.
Overall good. iOS version is better. Certain functions seem buried in submenus to keep the ui clean but makes the experience annoying and clunky.
It's a good app if you have Spotify premium but if you don't it's a bit annoying. I have Spotify premium and it only use to let me login offline so I couldn't use it with WiFi and download songs and now it doesn't let me login at all. Please sort that out for me. Other than that the playlists are really good and it's quite cheap.
"free music, yes, but it ALWAYS adds music to my playlists and it ruins them 'cause it uses up my skips and it ruins the vibe of the playlist when I'm listening to Queen and Bowie and suddenly a Ed Sheran or T Swift song just starts"
"I just came back to Spotify after using other services, enticed by a special offer. I love the desktop experience but the app is sluggish. Kind of ruins your vibe when you are trying to go for a run or do anything quickly."
It's a good app but for some time now it acts like I don't have Spotify Premuim even though I pay for it every month.. On the laptop it works fine but on the phone it's like I don't have Premuim besides the non adds thing.
"The app is good, but Spotify consistently presents some quite annoying bugs. For example, in the current version the app will sometimes say that there's no internet connection even though I'm connected and using other apps. So every now and then I have to kill the app and start it again."
Playlists and searches buffer for too long. Sometimes app quits or resets while searching for artists and song. It was better when it was newer. Not impressed with the current version. $10/mth is too much for a broken app. please fix your problems
"Overall a good app but has several shortcomings that let it down, notably the fact that it thinks playing Ariana Grande to a heavy metal fan as a suggested song is suitable.. The app should be optimised more for android devices, it definitely has improved but still favours iOS clearly.. Sometimes the searches don't display results even though they string is spelt right.. 7/10"
The app is super clunky. They could've done a much better job integrating this quick access for people who use this to listen to music in the car.
"Not 100% intuitive, makes a jumble out of what can be downloaded and what ""added to list"", but the service itself brings quality music to my device with plenty of customization and controls."
"It's an alright app, but the fact that adds are forcibly put to Max volume is awful. If you aren't paying premium and have decent headphones, it'll mess up your ear pretty quick if you aren't careful."
"Using Google music. Spotify seemed too complex for me from a ui perspective. Questions like 'how can I listen to this whole record of that artist' were not possible to answer in a short time - at least for me. Hence sticking to Goole music that seems to better vit my abilities (I am still sure there must be a way in Spotify to listen to full albums, but gave up)"
"The newest update sucks. The bottom task bar changed, the search guide is weird, you can't just click a browse button separate from search now. I really don't care for the update"
"I don't like the new design, not very intuitive, made things harder to find, especially radio, I liked it being its own separate thing instead of just being an option mixed in amongst the genres. Just my opinion"
Buggy and unintuitive. Refused to let me replay a previously played podcast episode. No feedback on how far downloads are. Not always obvious how to go to episode listing. Seemingly can't page between episodes on some screens. Overall it should be a lot easier to just open the app and resume/play an episode.
"This app, to me, used to be 5/5 and has and still is my only go to music platform. However, there is the issue of crashes left and right, and the ""fake start"" where it will show you loading the home screen until you restart the app. The latter has been a non issue woth my s9+, for some reson I can circumvent the problem by tapping another tab. Not the case for my old s5 or my much newer s8+, as well as a friends A5. This is something I concider quality of life issue, but the constant rearrangement of the UI is killing me, either hire someone that actually know how to rearrange it in a ergonomical(?) way or don't do it at all, it's getting old. And im not talking about your UI cause thats factory fresh every 6 months.(yes i know this is a trend for trendy apps, i.e. Chrome, messenger, facebook, and on) The only thing I can wholeheartedly praise them for is their costumer service in my experience, nice, polite, friendly and quick to pick up on a more casual tone of converse, which saves everyone alot of time, text chat wise. Would leave this in a feedback section, but there is non. Tbh feel a little bad for only giving 3 stars, but when there is no real way to complain without bothering the customer support guys, what can you do?"
"Spotify is used to be a good app, but now it's okay. I understand the need to ""streamline"" your product to make it user friendly, but the constant updates are annoying. Can I get my repeat/replay button back please?"
"If it's required to purchase the premium version to listen offline, it's okay. But why just a click to move forward to the next song I need premium version too? This is too much Spotify. I can't even play the exact song and I need to shuffle everytime I listen. This is a nightmare for the users. Please make it simple. I know this is business but at least have some mercy towards people."
The app takes really long to load. I have been using Spotify for years. The UX has improved but still remains slow . Time to move on to something else
"I hVe premium and have enjoyed it for quite a while. However for the last few weeks on my Galacy S7, spotify crashes when listening to anything aside from downloaded music. No point in having the app anymore if that's the case. Might as well use pandora instead."
"Solid function as a streaming music service, however illogical UI decisions and the inability to turn ""features"" like videos in playlists off is aggravating and baffling."
App has some serious usability issues: Podcasts hide the time playing for some reason whatsoever. It doesn't even display the time remaining for the podcast. The forward and rewind buttons are not mapped to headphone controls like Google podcasts. Won't automatically download or notify of new podcasts either. Frequently says I'm offline even though I'm connected to wifi. Starting a radio repeats the song. I'm considering switching to a different streaming provider
Quite laggy even on a decent phone. Still uses the confusing UI where things slide every which way. Good playlists and sound quality on premium
"Spotify seems to have been plagued with stability issues lately - most recently my app seems to think it's still streaming to my Echo when I'm listening through headphones on another network, and won't let me adjust the device's volume. Requires a restart to resolve."
"Great selection of music with some critical design flaws: removal of chat feature, inability to alter user name, and limited access to certain foreign music catalogs (for U.S. listeners)."
I've used spotify premium for years and I have always loved the app. I would have given it 5 stars before. I really hate the redesign for the app. It is laggier than ever. Just not as good as it was a few months ago. I'm disappointed that updating made the app worse. I've tried to be open minded about the new things they are doing with the app but I'm just fed up with it. Please go back to the old app! I dont want to switch to apple music but I feel as if I'm being forced out of liking this app.
"I imagine it would be a good app if you get the premium = pay for it. But I am writing from the perspectives of a student not willing to pay for every app to get rid of the adds.. I use the free version Spotify, so adds are really annoying and it's glitching quite often."
"Good App for listening to different genres of music however it is very frustrating that the app decides that it is no longer online when nothing has changed and I am still online with other apps. If this persists, I'll simply find another app to suit my needs."
"The app is super slow and quiet often stops playing at all without any reason. Reinstalled several times, no changes. Really disappointed as I'm premium user."
"Finding offline content quickly is impossible, not as user friendly as it could be which is a shame when so much great content is available. Also overpriced for subscription, Netflix and Amazon Prime are much cheaper for heftier content"
"Can't find a way to shuffle tracks on demand? So more play controls would be beneficial. Not keen on having to manually add songs to queue, when a quick shuffle might suffice?"
"I have been using spotify for quite a while now. And recently, I found a bug where there is just a random song that I didn't add on the playlist and I could not find it. And I am a free user. Can someone help me fix thid bug? Thank you. But overall, I really like the app."
+5 for All The Music. -1 because the interface is still terrible. Most other music players have an Add to top/bottom of queue. And the default button on an album (not a playlist) shouldn't be Shuffle; it should be play straight through. -1 because not really all the music.
"I use this app daily, but that means that I regularly encounter a set of vexing problems: - Chromecast volume control regularly vanishes, requires terminate/restart to restore. - Frequently fails to register presence of a Chromecast on a local network in a reasonable timeframe (15m after arriving, Android device sees Chromecast for screensharing almost immediately) - Random stops (often at points of network handover from WiFi < - > cell data) - Little/broken support to Airplay to Apple TV from Android devices (phone can control if another device starts playing, can't view or establish connections with Airplay devices)"
It's great when it works but it has alot of quirks that make it a frustrating app. Shuts off on its own and pops up at random times not happy paying for a service that isn't reliable.
Not one hand friendly when picking songs on the fly. I change my mind about genres of music all the time. I don't like having to take time to actuallu build a playlist. The weekly mixes are nice but a lot of lame songs pop up. I guess I have lame taste but a few are slaps so whatever. Most artists are on here except a few lesser known ones.
The UI is confusing and awkward because it doesn't follow any standard Material design patterns. Chromecast integration is also super buggy.
"Interface is just awful when you buy premium, it looks so much better and actually works properly in the free version, only downside is ads but honestly that's great compared to the ui"
"The app is somehow counter-intuitive in the way done functions work. But my biggest feature request would be for lossless playback. Come on Spotify it's 2018 we're not in dial-up please give us the option of lossless. Being able to download playlist tracks is excellent and very useful, as I'm frequently DJing in village halls which have no WiFi or mobile data."
"Good but still needs some basic features, like going back in the playlist by pressing thrice on your headset button, any other music app has that functionality."
Good performing app but issues with latest version not being able to stream with Sonos & a security issue allowing the phone to be unlocked without requiring a password on the lock screen.
"Occasionally crahes, occasional bugs like music continuing to play after the earphones are unplugged or pausing for no reason, no im not logged in anywhere else."
Serious glitches with the app causing playback to suddenly stop. Has been a continuous problem for over a year now. Quite annoying to deal and gets me in the mood to stop paying 9.99 for such a headache.
"Music selection is great. The app hangs up often, stops showing notifications in the status bar, loses connectivity (while having a good connection), sometimes decides to stop playback, often does not save your spot in podcasts, and other general nuisances."
Lots of playback issues. Doesn't play with Google Home. Great UI. Best social and sharing features of all the apps over tried. Functionality issues are frustrating.
"There is a bug that if I open this app and I push the play button it doesn't start playing. I first have to skip the song en then go back. There is also a bug that Spotify thinks it's offline when I search a song. And sometimes if I have the app open too long in the background I have to restart the app because it doesn't play the music. And sometimes the notification bar just disappears even if the music is still playing. I have a OnePlus 6, I hope you can fix it. Further it is a nice app"
It was so good when I had an iphone but I have a samsung s8 now and it stops playing unexpectedly quite often and always says I'm offline when I'm not. A few bugs to fix but is still worth having premium xx
"Used to be very good, but app is a mess for months now, and with the way bug reporting and support go at Spotify, that doesn't seem to be changing anytime soon. Seriously looking at unsubscribing and looking for alternatives. Spotify: add a bloody bug report button to your app and stop requiring account registration and a ""vip"" forum account just to be able to report bugs in your broken software. I would have already reported several if you didn't make it nearly impossible to do so - the forum is damn near useless at this point. Then maybe we wouldn't have to use a broken product now..."
"The app was far better but since the last update it randomly shuts down, the bar in the notification window disappears and if you skip too many songs the UI can't keep up so what it says is playing doesnt match what is actually playing. Like many other recent reviews I hope they resolve these issues quickly!"
Whatever happened in the new update is messsssedddd up..my wholeapp is so fu**** . Cant even pause it i have to close my app to get muisc to stop. Wont show correct song on car . Im sure its easy so lets get tot fixing people
"App really lets the service down. Used to be absolutely perfect but as of recent the app has gone absolutely downhill. I have bought premium because i listen to music while not connected to the internet, and sometimes the ongoing notification doesnt come up, sometimes the next button doesnt work, sometimes the shuffle play doesnt work, definately not worth the $12 im paying every month at the moment."
This app is my absolute favourite for music and I have happily paid for it for quite some time but the recent glitches like telling me I'm offline when I absolutely am not are killing it. I've had to re download the app every 2 days just to be able to search for music. Please please fix this.
"Just calling Spotify out on quietly removing ""extreme"" quality on streaming, and then after a while on downloads as well, while keeping the service the same price. Come on guys."
"The app was good in general. One thing really bug me though is the widget does not work. Sometimes it's just blank, and all other times it does nothing when I push the 'play' button. I'm on Android Oreo."
