review_description
"I'm only able to play 3 songs then it stops streaming all songs. When I press the play button nothing happens. To fix, I have to restart the phone, logg out then in, or reinstall the apps. When either of those things are done, it still only plays 3 songs then stops playing again. This needs to be fixed or I'll switch to another service. I have a Samsung galaxy s22 ultra."
App keeps on crashing no matter how many times I reinstall it. Apps that require a paid subscription and when you are unable to make use of it are really a bummer.
The UI is atrocious. Clearly no one at spotify uses this or does any tests whatsoever. Where is everything? Literally every other Music app has a better UI. My Suggestion: Make it not atrocious. It also crashes randomly.
Albums aren't loading. UI looks good. Please fix albums aren't loading
"I can't open the play-pause-next button and song previewed anymore but the song still played, please fix this."
"This app has not worked for 2 months, can't open the app, only way to open it was long press the app then click the liked songs but then if you press the home button on the Spotify app then it crashes. For 2 months! Tried reinstall, clear data nothing works. Fix the app"
Ads just ruin it. Especially the AD that says enjoy the next 30mins add free. That's literally an ad saying there's no ads. Geez who doesn't have something that blocks ads nowadays? Going back to my ad blocker site. Not snitchin. Annoying app for me I'm sorry.
This app is so bad just busy to show huge amount of ads after a nano second even i cant play a single song because of lengthy ads. its a waste of time to use this application . youtube and other apps are better than this app. Thank you. Ads is not everything spotify has to give skip button or something like that from which we can skip ads. this app making me angry because its wasting my time. im uninstalling this app and installing again soundcloud thats it.
"Songs are not playing unless I close the app, open it and play the song again. I have to repeat the process for each song. Rating 1 star for you to take actions quickly, it's been a week."
Craftmanship from USSR and a comic book villain capitalist ruling over it. Everything is made hard. Shuffle button behind a pay wall but why would you pay if the music keeps stopping at random and only way to fix it would be restarting the phone? If they want to sell the shuffle button they should at least show it in free version (grayed out for example). Not let people search the internet IF there even is an option
"Spotify is a great service,but the app gets buggy sometimes. Managing podcasts can be a chore also, but overall it's pretty good. Miserable experience in the last week. Can't play a new songs for more than minutes, it freezes for no reason. Please fix this it's ruining the whole experience"
"songs often get stuck at 0:00 basically it didn't even play. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling it a quiet few times but it still happens. pls i beg you to fix this immediately, this app is my coping mechanism."
"Free version is the worst. Try making a playlist and only listening to those songs. It's impossible. I don't want recommended music, I don't want similar music I only want to hear the music I selected to make a playlist. Give me All the ads you want but don't add music I didn't ask for and then penalize me for skipping them. This is the equivalent to bullying a person to pay for a service and I won't stand for it. If you choose to use the app don't do the free version cause you'll hate it"
"I'm sick and tired of having unwanted suggested songs autoplay and shuffle in whenever I try to play a playlist, and being unable to skip them if I've used up the amount of skips given per hour. I can't even get rid of them from my queue without skipping even if I try to click off onto other playlists or close the app. Hiding the song does nothing to help either. PLEASE give us an option to remove suggested songs from our queue/let us edit what songs are coming up by having a music queue button!"
"The free version feels completely pointless, in it doesn't perform the most basic requirement of a music player - letting you pick songs you want to listen to, and listen to them. You can only give it a loose suggestion of what to play for you. And then you still get ads. I can't speak to the premium version, but the demo experience has done nothing to make me consider trying it. Just use youtube instead"
"This is quite possibly the worst app I've ever installed (uninstalled now). You can't listen to what you want, only what they force you to listen to. Search is useless. UI makes very little sense. Never using this awful rubbish ever again! Would give 0 stars if could"
Stops playing music/podcasts after 30 or so mins. There's no 'now playing' bar at the bottom anymore so you can't skip songs/skip/rewind on podcasts. Earbud button functionality has gone. Spotify need to sort this out in the next week or so or I'm going to cancel my sub
"Horrible fake promotions , I opt for the premium plan which was availble for 120 /- after availing Student discount but after making the payment, debit amount was 450 /- and I didn't recieved any info why they have charged 3 times of original price. Also even after upgrading to premium, app still has some bugs, earlier download button was not working but after sometime it was working. I don't know why they have charged 450/- even after receiving receipt via mail showing Amt 120/-"
"I wish I could give 0 stars. I love Spotify so much but have been having major issues for years. I almost never update because every time I do something goes wrong which makes it unusable. Realized I hadn't updated since 2020, so I updated and it took me off of my premium family plan even though NO info changed, I can't see my playlists OR the play button/bar, and I have to close the app to get the audio to stop. Please fix this MESS of an App for real, this is ridiculous."
"In the start it was quite good, last month ive been trying to fix it but cant, i only see the artist and the song title but when i click it its on a duration, please spotify fix this. Ive been uninstalling installing but stil not fixed."
"This app has gone downhill, cuts out half way thru a song, the play button dissappears, takes a long time to load my playlists, even with wifi at its full, they better do something or else people will move to another platform,"
Super slow to open. Have made UI worse. Downloads hidden from view for no good reason.
"Your delete playlist button it right under the edit playlist button. I've accidentally deleted two very large playlists now. Piss me off. Move delete to the bottom of the settings on a playlist. Or underneath ""invite collaborators"" at least like come on. I'll bump you to 5 stars when this is fixed."
"This would have been a 5 star review before the update completely ruined things. I love Spotify and I use it to study all the time but because of the update, songs refuse to play and I've tried everything on the help website but it's still the same story. I AM SO ANGRY ABOUT IT"
"I dont like the fact when I listen to my play list a weird song comes up that is not even on my play list. You also got rid of the looping buttons and only gave me 6 skips. I also don't want you premium. I have more things to worry about than your premium. Another thing I would like to add is the shuffle button on the playbutton, I hate it. I liked being able to listen to my music over and over again. I would rate it better is you've kept the loop buttons and gave me more skips."
"Why does it require premium to skip songs more than 6 times an hour? So petty. ""No, Jesse Pinkman, You can't skip songs until you pay ten bucks a month."" Audiomack is better than this, and that's saying something."
"Frequently glitches out. Can't see now playing and skip/play/pause. Frequently errors ""Spotify is trying to play"" while playing... Requires force close or phone restart to work as intended."
They Keep removing features. E.g. music preview on playlists..... (Next feature.....is disable the play button too why not 🤷) just have a big pay to unlock. Sack your Dev team! The apps gone downhill.
They ask for premium always and ruin ur pleasure of using da app
Spotify used to be a good app until I wasn't able to see my playlists or play them. And if I tried to play them it would just load infinitely. And I have great wifi. So I recommend using another music app besides this one cause it just ruins the fun of music.
The app suddenly stops playing music on my Pixel 5a. I can't use it normally and it's quite annoying
"Not sure where to report bugs so I'll just do it here, once it's fixed I'll change my review appropriately. Whenever I go on any playlist, go to find an artist, click onto either ""See more"" or any albums and preview the song, and then try to click the back button (both in app back on top left and Android back button, don't know if that matters), it crashes the app. I've tested multiple times under different circumstances and that's just what I've found :P"
"Been a premium member for years, and just noticed that my friends cannot listen to ANY of my custom playlist that I've made, which is about 95% of my collection. This is unacceptable. I've deleted and reinstalled many times and my friends still can't view my playlist to listen to the songs. I genuinely love this app and I'm sadden to see the lack of effort being used via your platform."
"I took great efforts in building playlists over years. Then one day I wake up and .. --> ""log in to continue"". I try logging in, ""no user found with this email"". I try all 4 of the emails that I have ever created in my life; no luck. I try my phone number, no avail. Forced to make a new registration, I finally log in. And... BOOM! ALL PLAYLISTS GONE! All history gone. All favorites gone! Thank you for a wonderful experience"
"(No i dont have premium btw)I will be quite honest this is the only reason im pissed but i just looked at my ""episodes for you"" thought it would be fine cause i never listened to anything weird on spotify well it seems they like digging into ur personal life like sexuality because on my recomended is something that should not be on this app called big bro's frat party where the picture is dudes having sex with prety much no clothing and im not out or want to be forced out by this or see it ."
"have had the 'Premium' subscription for awhile now, and have really enjoyed Spotify. recently, however, cannot get Spotify to play podcasts on Google nest. apparently this is a known problem with Spotify. music is fine. podcasts won't play on a number of external devices. extremely disappointed that this issue has been plaguing people for 6+ months with no sign of solution...and we're still paying full price, for partial service. Spotify, i really want to love you again. can we work it out?"
I've been using spotify for too long for it to constantly get worse. Currently it keeps lagging. Player dissappears in the app so you have to close it to be able to skip a song. Shuffle button is moved again so it takes longer to shuffle music since system always plays same songs out of thousands. It's just small bugs that could get fixed (and were) that keep making experience bad.
"Its like the Spotify team tried to make the worst possible UI. Non of it is intuitive and a lot of features are either hard to access or not present. Unless you NEED spotify I'd recommend anything else, like Soundcloud."
Lately experience is awful. Every time rather cell phone is connected to 5G Network the app does not build enough buffer and the playback is really choppy!
Uninstalling App coz 1 song we listen and we've to listen 4 advertisement of 30 sec for each. No skip button after few sec. We can handle 1 advertisement after one song but not so many. For money they'll keep irritating you while enjoying the music.
When you try listening to a certain song it forces you to listen to all these other songs because there's mix button that you can turn off and add after less than 3 song and 6 free skips every hour I would give this 4 stars on Spotify for PC and laptop cause the only downside to that is ads every 30 minute and you can't download songs but that's all fix if you get Spotify premium.
Worst app on my phone and TV. Continuously crashes and takes out additional apps and often entire OS. Plays when unprompted. Maintains play after stopped. Maintains Bluetooth connections when my phone Bluetooth is turned off. Poor quality. Continually loses songs I have previously liked without warning. The software design is trash. Good service. Trash app. I like many others only stick with the app. If I were introduced to spotify brand new tomorrow I'd laugh at the person who recommended it.
"I do not like how it does not let me search up the songs, when I press the edit button to put in songs, but it doesn't show up >:( Please fix this now"
App sux. Kicks my family out. Freezes often
It was good before but now I cant choose what song to play because it automatically shuffles this feature was free but now you have to pay 10$ a month just so you can choose what song you wanna play. This is outrageous at this point and has completely ruined Spotify for me now somehow Pandora is better PANDORA IS BETTER HOW??!?! Just because I cant choose a song without it automatically playing a song I don't wanna listen too and I don't wanna pay ten whole dollars just so I can play a song.
"Breaking so many privacy and permission laws. I was 100 miles away from home playing Pandora and driving, my wife started playing Spotify at my home on Sonos, suddenly my phone began playing Spotify. My phone had an update that morning and I don't use Spotify, so I had never opened it or attempted to use it. Obviously Spotify has backdoor access to everyone's apps and therefore their phones/devices. I expect to see a lawsuit in the near future."
This is awful. I had to Google had to turn off shuffle. Worst UI on a music streaming app I've ever tried to figure out.
"I thought about downloading this because my daughter uses it all the time, but now they've bought and ruined Heardle for everybody there's not a chance!!"
"Move the cast button away from the heart button, im tired of removing my liked songs ive had for 5 years just trying to cast."
They took away the podcast new episode button so I can spam listen to podcast this sucks
"I love the UI of the app, but I found a lot of problems... First: when I put some song, the reproduction bar disappear. Second: In some cases the buttons doesn't work well (if you press them noting happend). Third: The app pause the song by itself. These problems stared since the last update of the app."
"Whenever I try to open my liked songs, it doesn't open. Just shows a blank screen. If this is a bug, kindly fix this quickly!!"
"You guys have ruined this app. Until the most recent updates, I recommended this app all the time. Now you cant select a song, can't select an album, can't even listen to music without it crashing. I'll never recommend this to anyone again."
Too many ads detoriating user experience. I'm new to Spotify therefore not liking it.
"Last update ruined app, nothing works. As soon as I'm on WiFi music stops."
spotify did not working on mobile data network! this is issue for us also complains about of my friends solve this issue quickly so we can use this application !!!
"I lost all my downloaded playlisy in the last update! About ""downloaded"" button in the playlist ... would be nice to have the same button when using Android Auto..."
I like this app. I've discovered so many music artists thanks to it. I'm giving it 1 star because of the ads that have that buzzing mosquito sound effect. I listen with earbuds and hearing that is unpleasant.
"Very worst app.....the ads are annoying in the middle of song...also no regional songs like we get in YouTube....we are forced to listen what are available and difficult to search favourite songs, some times not available my favourite songs.....I don't know how oppo provide in-built service this app.......very disappointed....."
If you don't wish to suffer then please don't download this thanks to the new update this app has became less favourable because the remove the unshuffle button and the choice to let you pick the music you want
"Its really unfair on how you can only turn off the shuffle button when on premium which makes free users not able to pick their right song when choosing. Its unfair and also, some users baught premium for that and it doesnt work like they just got scammed. Please fix your app."
"Designed to play music and podcasts. The playback stops randomly for no apparent reason. When I tap on an album in 'discography', the next page/screen comes up blank, so I literally can't play an album of my choosing... The app is inconsistent and unreliable, which I can't communicate to the Devs bcz there's no way to contact them directly. Support options direct me to the Spotify 'community', who can't help with these clearly common issues. Very poor. Sent Email. Here's hoping..."
"New ""what's new"" tab replaced the podcast feed and now only was way less UX friendly now has also completely disappeared. Really not a good change"
I can not even open the App anymore. It startet when I quit my premium subscription. Since than I have not been able to open Spotify.
Liked songs not open that the issue resolve quick please This type of issues worst solve the problem fast
"App is broken and unusable, as a premium member I will not be continuing to pay for something I can't use. UPDATE: App is still broken after July 13th and 18th updates"
Used to be great but now when I try to open the app it just shows the spotify logo on the screen but nothing else comes up. So I can't play anything. Hoping this gets sorted quickly or there is no point keeping my Premium membership.
I am not able to login to spotify. It shows error to update country but not allowing to login to update the country. I also cannot remember password and its not allowing to change the password too. This is too poor design of the application. I hope this can be considered and rectified.
Play buttons go missing regularly and when I'm driving making this a reality sketchy app I pay for a premium but the app is dreadful
The audio stops playing randomly mid-playback. The media player quite often stops being displayed on the app screen or in my notifications. Casting occasionally cuts off mid playback. Various buttons also occasionally stop functioning seemingly at random.
Recent update ruined app. Now it's nothing but adds after every song (despite the ad that should allow more). Limited skips (understandable). Annoyingly I'm unable to play any liked songs. It now just plays a random song similar to them instead of that Playlist. I have yo use 5/6 skips yo get to a song I actually enjoy. It's honestly worthless now. I had to go back to YouTube and pandora which is just sad.
What the actual hell the app doesn't want to open Its been working fine until it suddenly decided to stop opening for no reason I've tried uninstalling it to no success.please fix this quickly I really need music it's a major part of my daily life.
"The people behind the app keep making UI updates. I really like Spotify, but stop changing the UI. You keep removing elements. The most recent is the option to view the most recent podcast episodes across all my podcasts in one simple place. Stop moving things around arbitrarily. Why do you need to make things confusing when they already work so well?"
This app plays philippine communist studies. Ban these podcasts. The app is being used to recruit students to join terrorist/commie in PH.
"I like the music selection, and I like that I can use it for an alarm. What I don't like is that the shuffle button is always on, and the only way to turn off shuffle is to buy the premium. Putting a basic function behind a paywall is stupid and frustrating"
"Since last update I have lost control of how I can play music, it stops for no reason, there is no play pause buttons anymore. The only way to stop the music is by closing the app. Today i can't even play music at all... What's next? Spotify any solutions? Do I have to keep paying for your no service? A month later and it keeps stopping on its own!!!! Please fix the bugs!!!!!!!🤦 7/17 New realease and same troubles..."
"Shuffle button only plays 10 same songs, music stops randomly mid track, downloaded songs cannot be played. This app used to be good, now it became a piece of dung"
"Cuts off songs ¾ of the way through, won't play the songs I PUT on a Playlist but will play an algorithm within MY Playlist. I cannot in good conscience pay $10/mo for a premium subscription when the base version is more interrupted than the radio. Update: I'm done. Keep your Playlists, suggested songs and ads. You've ruined this app. Now I have to go create new playlists on a different app. THAT is time consuming and tedious."
How do you even play it. Press play button and it keeps going to Bluetooth even though my watch is already connected to my phone
"Why would you take up precious screen real estate by adding a button that only does 2 things? -Record a podcast?! Why would I ever do that on my phone?? And what % of your users make content? -Create a playlist?? That belongs in the library where my playlist lives . I create a playlist once every few months, I don't need that staring at me all the time. Stop adding random 'features' and just focus on squashing bugs, please."
I can't switch my storage to my SD without it showing my entire library as gone and every playlist as empty. I followed every one of their troubleshooting guides and nothing worked. Just use a different app cause this one sucks.
"I'm experiencing an issue where a song would randomly lag for a few seconds, multiple times and it would ruin the experience for me because it's so annoying to listen to"
"For the first year or so spotify worked fine and I had very little problems or complaints, recently however not one of my liked songs or playlists shows up in my library. I've tried all I can think of and, as you might understand, all of my songs I have in my playlists I enjoy a lot, and to lose all of that is disappointing and irritating. I really do hope that this issue is resolved quickly or I will have to take my listening somewhere else. Thank you."
"Basic feature about showing Song names quite terrible. As professional Hong Kong user which will listen song different countries, like Japan, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong. As English phone user, why spotify force user to see the songs with strange translation, or not able user to choose the language to view the name. Since spotify still not support hires music, I am going to choosing another substitute and cancel subscription. Thanks."
Battery eater deluxe! Thanks i get to almost hear part of a song and then it cuts out yet the time keeps advancing. Next thing you know a 3 minute sing is 24 minutes long.... Nothing plays of course but it eats the battery. This sucks!!!
Bring back native language song name otherwise I will just quit the subscription!
There's a bug on this app where for some reason the playlists or podcasts don't want to open up. I've restarted my cellular data even the app itself but still nothing seems to show up it does in fact load in the playlists and podcasts but when I click on them to load them up it doesn't seem to load them. I've tried restarting the app but still doesn't want to work. Please fix this soon i hate how this ruins my day when im on my way to work or coming home and i can't listen to my favorite music.
"It's terrible, the new update ruined the playlist format the old was better I hate the new playlist format"
I loved the app when I first downloaded but recently hate it. My daughter pressed the hidden icon one a few of my favorite songs and I am unable to un do this. No matter how many times I press the button or try to download the song again Nothing works. And a few other problems.
"It was running quite good but from last month some song are getting dissappear from the app . i loved those songs the most . The songs were fairytale ,awara shaam hai , marriage ,etc so i request to please solve this problem"
4-5 days before it was good not but my playlist it ruiend it doesn't let me play full song form my playlist and don't even shows the song properly
I search for some songs find them go to press play and a completely different song plays and sometimes the play button doesn't work please fix this this is an edit I found a way to listen to the songs but the problem is still there how long did it take me to figure that out I don't know is it easy yes
"I have spotify on my playstation and it works fine but on mobile its a catastrophe. I search for a song, i press play, it does not play the song I want and plays other song and there is not fast foward or backwards button. I hate this app, uninstalling"
"Just paid for premium and was excited to try the app. Open app and just stays on logo screen. Forums show this has has been an issue for over two weeks. Not a good first impression. Depending how quickly this is fix, I'll modify this review"
Never had an issue until this last few months. Play bar won't pop up when I hit the playback button. I have to force quit the app and relaunch each time...which is often. Now this is a daily occurrence and something I wouldn't expect from a payed service. The app is now borderline unusable. Do better.
"Spotify no longer allows you to sync local files from your desktop to your phone. I can no longer listen to indie artists (whose music I paid for) or bonus podcast episodes (that I also paid for) that I downloaded and added to Spotify. Spotify, change this back! The reasons to pay for premium are quickly depleting. Not to mention how constantly glitchy the app is."
"I love spotify, and have been using it a lot, but this recent update has completely broken the app and I can't even use it. I hope they fix it very quickly, if not I might just say bye bye to my spotify and move to other streaming services."
"Previous and shuffle buttons are not shown, how to fix this problem?"
"Good marketing strategy on ads which intentionally leads to use or listen to this app 30 mins. The next 30 mins. After an update or long break for usage i am unabke to open the existing account this is my 3rd account.☹️👎But still i am using this app because UI is good, otherwise i would change.. Unable to play the online playlist in loop mode which is very irritating and makes the worst of time👎"
"Really glitchy with new update. Music or podcasts I'm playing do not show up as a player, app quits unexpectedly all the time. Going to cancel my subscription until it is sorted out."
What is the point of having an app that can apparently play the music you want if it doesn't do that?? I can't believe this app requires you to flipping have a premium account JUST so you can have a freedom of choice in it. I have to sit through all the garbage songs that they keep recommending to me on shuffle just so I can listen to one song. And even when I click the play button of the song I want NOTHING happens. Stupid app.
"seems like every update they make a stupid change and takes 3 steps backward while making 0 forward. Downloaded music doesn't doesn't work offline, slow af, garbage af, and no innovation at all. Absolutely disgusting how terrible this app is. Going to switch to another music provider real quick. What a waste of money. The ""developers"" who keep ruining this app should be fired and never work in the tech industry ever again. GOD DAMM APP DOESNT WORK."
"Ive been using spotify for a few years now and have never had any issues with it till an recent update where the shuffle button tht youd push to randomize your favourite/saved songs is now just a normal play button. I understand this was a request by Adele but you should of made it a setting option for what the hutton does. This is seriously annyoing as now I always have to start the music off from the last song I saved, listen to the whole thing before it will start shuffling my playlist.."
The app is STUPID the play button IS BROKEN I do not want to play all the songs on the site I do not recommend useing the phone with this application
"Only opens with the logo showing up in the middle of a black screen, then never responding after. Tried all the things I could in reddit and guides online, same result. Uninstalled multiple times and reinstalled only to be met with the same exact result. Tried deleting cache and data, still the same thing. Hope to hear from you."
I hate the new UI I could've gotten over it if you didn't also make all my private playlists public. So tedious to make them private again.
"They absolutely ruined Spotify. Now I can't even listen to the songs I like, it just plays some stupid playlist with songs I don't even know. It used to be really good but now I can't do anything without it doing the opposite of what I want it to."
This app doesn't work on my phone please guide me My phone us samsung galaxy A70
It has way too much Ads than before. Before you can listen to songs uninterrupted for 30mins . Now it's ad after 2songs. Sometimes one song. It's not worth it.. you could make user experience a little bit better
"Shuffle doesn't work, it just plays the same 10 songs out of my 500+ liked songs. Podcasts don't play at all, they just load infinitely or outright crash the app. If I could give it 0 I would, just use s different streaming app there's quite a few that are cheaper and actually work properly"
"Keeps stopping. Podcasts or listening to music. Stops every few minutes. Or if you need to pause or stop what you are listening to, there is no pause or stop button. You have to close the app to stop what you are listening to. Please fix this!!"
Version 8.7.44.968 does not show play bar randomly when playing podcast. When this happen it plays with audio breaking. Unable to stop the audio due to missing play bar unless quitting app. Android latest version for Samsung a71.
"I use Spotify's local-to-mobile syncing feature as a core reason for using the app, and lately, it's dropping sync constantly and my only solution is to manually remove those individual tracks from all playlists and re-add them one at a time, only to have new ones fall out of sync. Add that to the poor organization and over-streamlined way that the app likes to display everything & make consistent navigation difficult, & spotify is quickly becoming one of my least favorite apps to deal with."
I've been told it not opening on android is known but come on and fix this quickly. I use Spotify daily and it needs to be sorted.
"I switched phones with my wife. I logged her out, & spotify quit working. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted my phone, reinstalled again. The app never loads. Help. Please."
You guys sure have some dumb restrictions on being able to access/play the Starred playlist. UX Fail.
"Constantly having to restart app bc the play, pause and stop buttons disappear. It's so annoying. When it works right it's awesome."
Where the f did you put the sorting option for a Playlist? Been looking for 15 minutes and it looks like you've removed it. Are you guys deliberately being aholes? Edit: I found it by evidently swiping up by accident revealing a search bar and sort button that isn't visible when selecting a Playlist UNLESS you swipe up to reveal the cropped out search bar. Who the f thought that would be a clever idea? Fire them.
"Stopped working after logging out on Android, Huawei P Smart. App has frozen, and Spotify staff has told me that it is a software issue, so I have to wait for the next update which should fix it. I have now waited for several weeks now, but the app is still not working. I am working as a professionals musician, so my music streaming service is an imortant tool for my job. Thinking about changing to another streaming service now, if it does not get fixed very quickly!"
"Been a huge fan of this app for years, but the last month or so has been borderline unusable. The app constantly stops playing (connection is good, app is up-to-date, cache & memory is good) and I have to constantly restart my phone or uninstall/reinstall to see a play button in the app or on the lock screen."
"The video player works correctly less than 50% of the time on my Samsung s21 ultra. Constant crashes, starting and stopping randomly, crashing when playing ads, buttons magically vanishing, constantly having to close the app and re open it. Truly an awful video experience."
I have no issues with the app. App is totally fine. Pls pls o request you all to stop the ads its annoying and even ruins the mood so pls stop it. Not everyone have money to buy premium so please.
"6 skips an hour? haha what? I genuinely thought that was a joke that was played against newly signed up users. yeah it's not. Can't forget how they add awful songs to your playlist that you can't do anything about, oh and you can't choose what songs you play either, Spotify chooses. You cant fastfoward or go to the previous song. And please don't buy the premium version, just don't, don't fall into this trap that they set up to steal your money. If you're on mobile use soundcloud or YouTube."
"Been having some major annoying issues lately, from the music skipping like a CD, to being unable to see the song currently playing and access the skip/play/pause buttons, to now being unable to search for new songs all of the sudden, even after updating. No matter what I type in the search engine, it always says there are no results. And now it only plays like 4-20 of my 2000+ liked songs. It's not on shuffle, so it should play through all 2k songs, but instead it just repeats the same songs."
Music stops Music keeps playing after I've stopped it with my earbud or connected stereo. I'm only here for one exclusive podcast. I'd prefer to use it for all but the UI is terrible for podcasts.
"The actual music streaming service is really good, but the app itself is terrible. It is extremely buggy. Among other things, the app: randomly stops; frequently doesn't display the play/pause button or progress bar; marks podcasts as done even if you listen to 5% of them and intend to go back; sometimes the play button and progress bar appear but don't work (e.g. progress bar will be stuck even though audio continues); menus can be counterintuitive."
New update sux. It keeps dropping out and I can't turn the song off now or even find my play button I have to uninstall the app to stop the music now. I pay for premium... not happy jan
Having the same issue as quite a fee users. Pauses while playing and the bar disappearing. As a premium customer not great experience at all. When are we going to get an update on this
Been enjoying Spotify Premium for a few months now however as other users have already stated im running into problems of random pauses and the function bar has disappeared please sort quickly before people are force to take the subscription to a rival...Samsung A71
I am facing too many issues with this app. It automatically stops playing and the play button is not reflecting unable to view day by day this app is worsening it ability. Kindly rectify it ASAP or else u will us many of the users....
"Hi Spotify, we need you guys to fix the app pls. A lot of users have reported same issues: 1. The play button disappeared, can no longer able to fast fwd, pause or replay when listening to podcast/music 2. Unable to connect music to any other devices 3. The app stop playing after a few minutes. I have uninstalled n reinstalled the app multiple of times. It resolved for a couple of times then acted up again. I have never left a review before but this poor platform requires a fix,pronto. PLEASE"
The interface the UI of the app just got worse. Don't even feel like opening the app anymore
I legit deleted Pandora to get this. But there isn't a shuffle button for all the great artists that I want to listen to? I'm still new to the app but is there a way to shuffle all my artist or no?
"I used to love this app, but then there was an update that kind of ruined everything. 6 skips an hour seems like a kids app that your parents saw, I can't select a specific song anymore, I can't turn off enhance, and it's overall hard to use. I'm literally here to say that I hate the update and want the original back. P.s. it adds songs that you can't see, so if you only want 5 songs on it, you can't. You HAVE to listen to everything else. I've deleted it and switched to sound cloud."
Idk if the app is glitching or a new update but removed the pause button?
Idk how my shuffle turned on but I can't turn it off the shuffle button is nowhere to be found and now random things plays
Worst experience i just want to listen to single song with giving me a thousend other song . Horrible user experience.
"The app has gotten so bad, I used to love it but now its almost impossible to navigate anymore. You cant see or play the songs you want in your playlists anymore. You cant hear the full song before adding them to your playlist instead they only give a preview or something. It super hard and the search system has completely been ruined, I type 1 song and a thousand versions of that appear. I hope you change it back to the way it was."
"Don't usually write reviews for apps but this app is just terrible now. Recent updates have removed the ""now playing"" bar at the bottom. Can't skip/next/shuffle or see what's currently playing. Also stops playing in the middle of podcasts/songs and I have to stop what I'm doing, open the app, but then there's no option to click on what's playing in order to get it to continue with the play button. Been going on for months and am considering switching service providers at this point."
"No bar to show what's playing on Samsung Galaxy any more - can't see pause, play, skip buttons. Also stops playing every 10 mins like clockwork!"
The UI is good but you will not find many songs ... Bit an improvement needed in list especially Indian songs
I pay the monthly subscription and lately the app became really buggy. Pressing the play button and music won't start. After a few seconds or minutes it starts (not an internet connection issue) its happening on different devices aswell. Or the music starts playing and it doesn't show anywhere. I hope they fix these issues asap
"Garbage. No repeat button and I cannot jump to specific song of the playlist. Also, it keeps adding the songs I don't want to the playlist. But for those who wants a random song related to the playlist, this will fit perfectly"
Can't be dismissed from my lock screen without force-quitting the app. Swipe it off the lock screen and it's only gone until the next time you light it up. Right back at it. Crazy how bad they are at a functional android app.
"Selection of music is pretty good and improving, BUT the app itself is awful since recently! One would think that it would be straightforward to build a music player these days, but alas. The music randomly pauses, the player suddenly skips to next song, and now I can't even log in anymore!! (10.07.2022) Seriously considering unsubscribing! Please sort this out asap, this is completely unacceptable for a paid subscription!!"
"The library is a mess, as is most of the app. It's confusing, unrefined and ugly. Lumping podcasts, playlists, songs and artists together in the library is just poor design. At least separate the podcasts library completely. The icon design is also incredibly poor - get a proper adaptive icon and drop the black background."
"Awful excuse for a music streaming service, with the free advertised version purposefully designed to be so ridiculously stupid that it forces you to buy premium, which is too expensive just to get basic features. I would recommend using youtube instead considering you get all of the most basic features for free like you would expect from a FREE streaming service. I believe that Spotify should simply price the app before download. Though it would get them less downloads, it would be more honest."
"Hey I hate the recent UI updates and the preview feature in the playlist, there are other changes too that are quite hard to understand and I guess nobody's enjoying this... Request you to please rollback or I am switching to a different app"
"The new update on this thing is just trash, My songs suddenly get shuffled, I didn't press any buttons just the Music play button, And second i can't find the shuffle button either and third purchase premium for skipping songs? Is this a joke?"
"I love spotify but like my last review, the ads are way to loud, and to often. They come on every 2 songs, this ruins the listening experience. Ive gotten 8 ads in a row, it would be nice if i could get 20 minutes without ads."
"The play, pause, rewind, and fast forward buttons disappear on Android every few days. Super annoying. I'm switching to another platform. I'd recommend Amazon, Apple, or YouTube."
This app is very good for enjoying music but this app always required update after 3/5day 👎👎👎👎👎
"I can't fathom how such a big company has an app with so many issues. Most issues of any app I have by FAR for YEARS I constantly have to uninstall/reinstall, close and open the app, clear spotifys cache, reboot my phone, etc just to use the app.. ^these issues include: playbar vanishes, start/stop on pods/songs, freezing etc Extremely unfriendly for podcast mains Constant updates adding features idgaf about tho! Typically making the app more convoluted with its already legendary poo UI"
"Ew, gross. It literally refuses to play the ONE SONG by a niche artist that I want to hear. NVM I'll go pay to download it from the artist's BANDCAMP page. Probably the worst music app I ever tried to use, counterintuitive, nonfunctional, no feature for free having trash. What a waste of time and coding. Y'all should pay your developers better and maybe you'll have an app that works idfk."
Randomly starts playing whenever it feels like it and you have to force quit to get it to stop.
"The ""download song"" button is absolutely meaningless. Even if you have a song/album downloaded, you can't actually play it... Dumb design."
"The user experience of the free version is such garbage (3 minutes of ads followed by not the song you wanted to hear, followed by 3 minutes of ads). I just can't do bring myself to give money to a business that specifically creates a horrible experience to try to convince you to pay."
Lost download button. Can't download playlists.
For a pricey monthly fee the app should work the way it's expected to.. but unfortunately it no longer does... Constantly pausing when you don't want it to no pause button visible when you do want to pause no currently playing information screen So no way to skip forward back etc... And when the currently playing screen is available (often have to uninstall reinstall) still does not rotate to landscape mode ... Been waiting for this basic feature for literally years
"It works for a little then after a while it doesn't. When pressing the play button for a song a whole different song plays something I've never heard before, or pressed on but it shows the song I've requested playing please fix this."
They purposely throttle the app making it unbearable and a waste of time to use unless you have premium. Genuine disgusting business practice.
"Extremely Poorly Optimised. Autoplays the same song always, unintuitive navigation to artist album releases etc."
"Music and podcasts keep pausing for no reason. Also the playbar for whatever is playing (when it does decide to play) is mysteriously absent from the bottom of the app UI, and also absent from the pull down notification bar on my phone."
"This app is way to buggy for how big the company is and how long it's existed. Long load times, buttons fail to do anything. Continually having to speak to tech support. Avoid"
"Randomly stops when listening to music or podcasts. Quite annoying, missing Winamp more everyday."
"Not great to navigate, and it keeps screwing up to the point where I have to uninstall and reinstall it because it forgets that it's playing my podcast and gets rid of the controls. For $8 a month I can get my content elsewhere, it doesn't even intuitively bring up the next podcast I should be listening to"
Update 7-8-22: The shuffle is busted. Plays only what you recently discovered and spinned a lot. This rule is counter intuitive to what people expect from a shuffle.
Continually riddled with issues. Currently it will just quit playing on me. It does not seem like Spotify truly cares about customers through my experience I have continually felt ignored in that the issues are generally left unresolved for an excessive amount of time... Awesome to know it wasn't just my device because I just upgraded to the s22 ultra and the issues are still here with liked song filters like I've complained about for months
Won't play other songs after clicking the play button and I can't figure out where to turn off shuffle for my liked Playlist.
"The heart button doesn't work, so I can't add songs to my liked songs"
Continuing to say no internet connection.. with full bars. All other apps working.
"Was good at one point. A very long time ago. Now just fluffs its own playlists with fake artists. Spotify has discovered its more profitable to pay themselves than it is to pay actual people, and has stuffed its playlists with fluff to smother out actual artists. Couple this with the horrible death spiral that is Daily Mixes (read: same 25 songs you heard yesterday, plus all the songs you tapped ""block"" on- in case you changed your mind) and also F ""car thing"". I have a stereo but yall ruined it"
"Worst designed app I've ever used. Takes ages to load downloaded content, or to download content at all. Every page seems to take way too long to load. Get any other player."
"Premium user for 7 years but the app just does not work anymore! The play button is missing, and the app just stops working every 30 seconds when on mobile data!! What am I even paying for at this point? Even when the songs are downloaded and I am ""offline""!! And you can't speak with a human about these issues, there is no telephone number!! Soooooo disappointed 😞. Im also looking into other music options now"
"Do not buy premium. You still get ads for podcasts. It is not the podcasts' ads, they are supplemental ads that go straight to spotify. On top of that, they have overoptimized this just like every other app. Convenient to switch from car play to non car play, only problem is the floating button is placed right over the play button for a song or album. These overlooked problems are everywhere. Buttons on top of buttons, settings not saving, network not updating. I cant justify $9.99/month anymore"
"Since last update the queue system is broken only lets you add one song to a queue and will frequently bug out and hide controls for currently playing podcasts and makes it impossible to pause it from the app. I dont know how you managed to ruin your qrues system more the YouTube music buy this is embarrassing, if this isn't fixed by next billing date I'll be forced to move platforms so that I can actually listen to my music and podcasts"
"Frequently force close and current play button is missing, both in app and in my phone notification (also lock screen?."
Very poor for a paid service. -The music frequently stops for a few seconds -Play/pause and skip button disappears -The shuffle function favours like 20 songs I will be contacting spotify for atleast a partial refund.
"This ""intuitive"" app is worthless. The only good thing is its library, and its barely that. Update: still worthless. 7/7/2022"
The play and pause button are not coming on.
"It great and all, a good amount of adds but 6 skips per hour? THATS STUPID, I CANT LISTEN TO MY FAV SONGS AND ONE OF THEM DONT SING THE EXACT SONG. And STOP adding songs to my playlist!!! Your ruining it!!!!"
New update has problems with pausing and continuing play
UPDATED: the recent Android version is very buggy. Random pausing and display errors with the player not showing so you can't interact with the song requiring a hard close/open. Seems to be a common new complaint
"Keeps pausing on it's own every couple of seconds for no god damn reason. If I could just scroll from the top of my screen and press the play button I wouldn't mind, but I have to enter the app again to press play just for it to pause again."
Podcast video disappears randomly and doesn't show up even after force stopping the app. Terrible UI and I'm using android
"I have been experiencing a sudden stop to what am I listening. Several times in the same podcast for example. Also, lately there is an error and I can't see anymore the buttons. I was listening to a playlist, had the music stopped not by me, and had to go back to the same music manually. Or I didn't had the skip the music even visible on my screen."
"This app has major link and playback issues. I use it on android OS12. Firstly, you cannot play a direct song that is shared to you via social media. When you press the green play button to the bottom right of the song title the app simply ignores it and plays whatever it wants from random artists. If you enter your savedplaylist the same thing happens. This is very biased copyright playback since the specific artists on spotify cannot get there own music played per share. Fix it."
"Whenever I start a radio based off a song or artist (which is with the intention to find a NEW artist or NEW music that is related to the song/artist I'm starting the radio off of) it just creates essentially a playlist of music I've been listening to - and not even within the same genre off the song. I've realized that I haven't found any new artists or any new music, and just continuously listen to the same things over and over again which is quite depressing."
New phone and the player has to be force quit all the time does not work properly.
"Worst app ever. They give songs between ads, I mean how can they even put songs between the ads , it just ruins the joyful exprience of listening to the ads. If they remove the songs I will definitely give them 5 stars."
"Been going downhill for years (the UI to find anything is terrible, sound quality is average and when you download something it favourites it?!) but the way it struggles without an Internet connection is infuriating, it just shows a loading screen all the time, even for albums I've downloaded. I've downloaded them because I'm travelling and I know my connection is going to be bad so why am I staring at a loading screen"
"The shuffle button isn't on all Playlist. Music stops after 10 secs even after going into the app. Also, I thought if I had the premium duo plan then it would get rid of ads. Why do ads still come up on podcast?? UPDAT: we are now in a July and it's still happening.. remind me why I pay for this sub???? First review was from back in April 2022. Maybe if the music wouldn't keep stopping randomly it would make more sense."
"I pay for my monthly subscription and the same day it quits working. Tried uninstalling,, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting etc. Can't get past initial logo screen. So who's refunding my money????"
"I've been using this app for 4 years,but the new update is getting on my nerves.If you want to listen to a song you can't listen to it first if you even wanted to, instead it puts the songs in a order where you can't choose which one you wanna listen to first. Not only that, but when I tap on a song to listen to it instead of showing the play button it shows other songs and not the one I wanted to listen to. It is also frustrating when I wanna play a song on my playlist."
Forget this. Im going back to Youtube. At least there i can listen to the songs i want instead of my 30 ad free minutes being recommendeds of what i listened to last week. 10/10 do not recommend this app. Alot of problems built into the app on purpose just to pressure people into buying their premium. Premium in their case being a decent app that just lets you listen to your music which i shoukd get anyway. Total ripoff
I started payin for Spotify but is stops playing. I don't know why. Actually i am paying exactly for its playin in background. But it doesn't. Play button disappeared anyway. I can not shut it down. Unbelievable!
Performance is very poor When i search for music and I tap the play button it play different much
"I will never pay for Spotify. It's a scam. Literally every other song is an ad an then when I am able to catch a commercial free period, you guys ruin it. How do you let a 4 minute song go over 6 mins and had I not used one of your skips my whole 30 minutes would have been wasted on 1 song. It's absolutely ridiculous"
"I've been having issues connecting with remote play, my phone doesn't allow me to play songs directly from my favorite/hearted songs. Edit: This has been an issue for almost a year.. half the time I can't play music unless I click the shuffle button, it doesn't let me select individual songs. Not sure what I'm paying for at this rate. Tested on two Pixels and a Moto.. Edit 2: still broken two months later, collectively over a year. should i just give up??"
"Poor...30 seconds ads never felt like they last a long time till now. Especially when you're just trying to play music. I get that they need money...but bro...right in the middle of the Playlist? What's the point of listening your favorite song If an ads ruins your mood, hype and vybe just because you don't have premium."
What happened??? I can't pause it anymore. When I play something I don't get any of the buttons showing up on my phone. I can't pause and it won't even show what I'm listening to. I've even had it play right over other apps like books. It's become complete garbage.
"Extremely infuriating, I pay for Premium and Spotify wont even let me play the songs in MY playlist without playing a random ""recommended"" one, and there is no solution for this, and if there is they have done an incredible job of making the UI as confusing, cluttered and unnavigatable as possible. Unsubscribed, am now using a competitor, which is a lot better, for free."
It's a good app but the ads are just annoying and I don't know why we get 6 skips per hour like why not just remove the feature and sometimes I'll be in a sad mood and then an ad will come on and will ruin the vibe And and then another add will come on but look it's a very good app but just lower the ads and remove the 6 skips per hour thing please?!?!
Sorry bro!! If you give options to shuffle and play for every song I want to listen... I quit using your app.
"AVOID THIS APP!!! you are better off listening to song on YouTube. I uninstalled it 2 hours after I installed it. You can search for a song but when you try to play it Spotify decides you really should listen to another. I searched for Should Have Been a Cowboy, song not album. I hit the play button and what comes out of my phone? Bubby Shot the Jukebox. Ok, I must have done something wrong so I do it again. I never did get this steaming pile of fecal matter to play it get correct song."
This app doesn't let your critique anything; whether it be like racist or single minded podcasts like behind the bastards or necronomipod. I find it quite humorous that such a large business could be so reckless when so many of their podcast creators destroy lives without little to any evidence.
"More commercials than music, this is no longer a music app...it's an add app! Your own greed will ruin you."
"The first few days it was a great app where I could listen to music freely, but now I have six skips an hour! And when I go on my playlist it says THEY ADDED STUFF ON MY PLAYLIST! That's my playlist! How are you gonna add songs that I don't even like! The songs that you add are not why I made the playlist! You're just ruining it, I'm going to a diffrent app. This one is just a waste of time, and money for people who use Spotify premium"
"Ok, the latest update is just horrible, there is a limitation of the number of skips i can do per hour, and i can only play my playlist with shuffle, now my hardwork of making the order of the songs are just ruined, don't download this, plus you need to hear all the other parts of the song just to listen to the chorus, just... Don't download this, you're wasting your time, i don't knwo if they will change this tho"
Pushy and intrusive. Auto connects to Bluetooth devices with no option to stop it. Has soured the user experience.
"Can you fix this please? Just please please please please please, I'm begging you, why i can't download songs in my premium, like, the download button on my playlist doesn't appear color green when i tap the download button, and i can't even go offline because of that"
"I loved this app but recently when updated I cannot play songs from the playlistd that I made and when i press the play button it says that I get only 6 skips per hour. I mean like ""WHAT THE HELL"". I want to play the songs in an order i have set my self. Not mixed. And whenever i play a song spotify premium keeps coming off. I'm deleting this song until this is fixed. Until then Bye."
No pause and play button for ages!
The media player outside of the app and the progress bar inside the app disappear way to frequently. I have to hard quit the app multiple times to resolve the issue.
The app was great but the problem is the playlist button everytime i wanna hear some of my favorite song it goes to another music
"Spotify was my fav app till the updated it now it sucks i hate the new update you just can't turn off the shuffle button it's not even showing it now and it makes me soo mad all i want to say is,You have ruined spotify and everyone's saying the same thing you better fix this issue"
"Buggy mess. Don't use if you want to listen to podcasts. No player until you open the app back up and a lot of the time it's missing. I have to close the app and reopen just to find the pause button. Also it's way too sensitive and often accidentally skip the episode by the slightest ""swipe"" and often shows finished when I go back which is infuriating when the podcast is hours long. BRING US A PLAYER!"
"And again - Nothing has changed! Original post🤦‍♂️- The App now: Stops every 10 minutes. Carrys on playing & cannot be shut down. Does not upload. Yes, I've uninstalled. The latest update is poor, I have no idea how the UX or QA cycle ever got signed off. Downloaded content will not play when you move onto another episode. Cuts out. UI looks crowded and not smooth at all. Paying premium for a product that does not work properly. Acknowledge & own the faults Spotify, then fix! Thanks"
"You basically can't use it without premium at all. Also bugs and It shows I'm offline despite playing music from my own playlists just fine, but I can't search for music. Unusable mess pushing weird stuff on me when it does see the Internet connection. Unless you pay and build your own playlists, knowing exactly what you want to listen to yourself I'd never recommend. It's for people that love music itd for average person what doesn't know what to listen to and can get manipulated by algorithm"
Probably the most frustrating app in the store. Crashes often. Many features just don't work. (like add to queue doesn't even work) I'm a paid subscriber and quite disappointed.
Deleted. Started auto playing weird stuff. Turned off all auto play buttons but clearly not enough. There are better apps
Soooo many ads...... quick tip: quit your app when an ad plays and reopen it to no ad. Works well
"Why on earth have you taken a perfectly functional feature like Group sessions and made it worse? You've removed the ability to scan codes, which means when meeting new people I now have to somehow send them a link. You now default to playing music on all devices when I just want the music to come out of the one connected to the speakers. I don't get it, these changes are asinine. Whoever approved these changes need to be fired and you lot need to find the undo button."
"COVID warnings on podcasts now?? Are you kidding? 2+ years later? Now? Super LAME!! Download a podcast to play later, forget about it. Why? Because you NEED AN INTERNET CONNECTION!? Huh?? If it wasn't for Joe Rogan, I'd have bailed on this app a long time ago. it's so glitchy, unreliable, counterintuitive, stupid warnings. I have to force close it constantly & restart and sometimes it jumps to a totally random podcast maybe even a year old??"
Last update ruined playback. Pocast keeps stopping for no reason.
"Unplayed filter hides unplayed downloaded episodes. Constantly disconnects from ear buds requiring closing and reopening app. Also will sometimes take ages to download tracks. We're talking dialup speed. Also, will not work with Bluetooth with lots of restarts. Such a shame"
"Im paying for this and I still get ads. More and more. Not sure if its by the company or the podcasters, but its country specific, so its not a built-in ad. Even if its by the podcasters, you should not allow this. I hope youll fix this."
"Editing playlists, making playlists, and even playing songs are a chore using this app. The ui can use alot of work, and the fact that so many necessary features are locked behind premium make it so much more aggravating. The only reason I still use this app are the huge library of songs it contains"
They ruined it you can only skip 6 times and you can't even see what song is going to play next!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡
"spotify on chromebook is awful, i genuinely dont understand why it is so bad. the app shuts down almost every hour, the music is laggy and you cannot see friends activity. i really hope they improve the app because it honestly ruins my music listening experience while i work on my chromebook"
"Buggy mess on samsung fold. Whoever fault it is, the OS does not pick up spotifys audio stream as media, so once you start playing a song it cannot be stopped or interacted with without quitting the app. Audio continues to pay in background on other apps such as YouTube"
"The app wont load. Uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted phone, freezes at logo screen. I pay for this and cant access ANY of my music. That unsubscribe button is looking very tempting.."
I want shuffle button for free user or make this app non free user anymore
"I had problems soon after installing the app. It seems impossible to shut it off completely. I was trying to travel using the Waze app for navigation. Spotify kept playing music unexpectedly interfering with my trip. The only quick solution was uninstall it, so I could safely travel using Waze as intended."
This app's ui is worst then any other app. It always show shows you might like with irrelevant content. And we also can't remove the listens and unliked content from the home menu. It shows nudity type shows . And we can't remove this type of shows from our Spotify home menu. I hope you'll understand.
"Buggy, cumbersome, and lacks standard features. I used to enjoy having all my podcasts in one place, now I need to use your bloated, battery hungry app. Your garbage app autoplays podcasts even with autoplay off. Your garbage app plays ads at annoying times, ruining the moment on many occasions. Hate you Spotify."
None of my spotify playlist have music in them I have Uninstalled twice and still no joy pretty upset as I've been premium payer for quite a long time
"I've used spotify for the last few years and loved it, but the last few weeks have been clunky-songs randomly stopping and the music and plays when it says nothing is playing. It's quite annoying you cant adjust anything because nothing is ""playing""."
It was good in the begging but the random song thing ruined it and we have to pay
I loved the was grooving and vibing but one Spotify was all ruined I couldn't play song of my choice to play the playlist I must listen to song it plays and also it would play random songs that I didn't add to my playlist turns out it was the new update please bring the old Spotify back or tell me how I could fix that's why giving it a one star otherwise 10 out of 5
"I thought at first Wow what an amazing app so much better than YT music. But oh wait this morning I went into the app and it said ""your 14 day free trail has stopped"" WHAT I DONT EVEN HAVE PREMUIM! Now it has ditched all its good functions - example - ONLY 6 skips per hour, Can only play specific songs. The dumbest app ever. I'd rather pay for YT premium Than use this. 0 STARS IF I COULD RATE IT."
It always says I'm offline even on a super fast network & search doesn't work. It makes the app useless. This started in the recent builds from last 10 days or so Apart from that Amazing app. You have the fastest streaming service I have used really amazing. These feature requests look to be done 1.Reduce the amount of space it uses in my disk. 2.Genre playlist which plays songs in all languages in that genre Thanks for that.
"One star review because I can't play my favorite music without having some difficulties like let's say I would love to play ""build our machine"" by dagames but when I do, it just brings me to a useless album that doesn't even play the music I want to listen to and when I add music to my favorites playlist, it doesnt even play the whole song only a short 5 second clip of that song but when I play other music, it works like what and the shuffling oh my god who the hell cares about it? Just fix it."
"Andriod App is constantly bugging out and crashing. Stops playing randomly. Been having issues for months, nothing's been done about it. Requires a few restarts of app to work."
"This app is genuinely pissing me off. Can't listen to the songs I pick as somehow the app picks something completely unrelated instead. I'm not willing to spend money on features that I have for free on other streaming apps, but it would seem Premium is the only option for this app to even have a good experience. I'm uninstalling."
"Im on paid subscription but i can't keep this shuffle button off, whenever i play, it will automatically turn on. I uninstalled the app, clear cache and log out on all devices but it is still on."
One n only requirement is option to download songs for free
"Genuinely disappointed wanted to listen to the good the bad and the ugly instead I got some other song and couldn't even select it because I'm a free user, what a scam"
The app used to work very smoothly before but now the app don't work at all . I am not able to play any music . It was an ugly experience for me . Plss fix this quickly .
"App continuously stops when phone screen darkens on android, they are not issuing any fixes."
Cancelling my subscription. Going back to peace and quiet.
"It's literally impossible to listen to the song you are searching for , very bad user experience."
"Absolute terrible update. When shuffle play is on i cannot go back to listening the song i played. And i can't even turn off shuffle play because it requires premium. Such a bad app i used past over the months. And when i go to a playlist, i cannot even play the songs. Worst update."
"Absolutely horrible, cant even choose a song to play. Works worse than ever before and honestly literally anything else is better, even audio jungle and you hear it screaming at you half the time but it's still better than back to back ads and to fix all of the horribly stupid problems that are only on mobile mind you, you have to buy premium. Genuinely scummy and has likely resulted to lots of people abandoning a once semi-decent app. Absolutely deplorable and saddening."
What is wrong with Spotify? I play a playlist and songs which aren't included in the playlist start playing. I don't want to listen to those songs. Why does Spotify ruin the mood. The playlist and blends don work fine. 1 star.
Suddenly I can no longer use Spotify properly on the phone idk how but they suddenly ruined a good thing.
I can't even listen to the songs I love and only the songs I love anymore without a whole bunch of other songs come on instead it's so aggravating and you can't even skips as many songs as you want idc abt the ads but the other parts of this new Spotify app just ruined the whole app now I can't even listen to music that I want to pls go back a update.
"I just want to know how 3.5 gigs of cache builds up on an app in a few weeks, when I regularly clear each apps cache through my phones settings. Also start paying musicians more you Cnt"
"Had to go back to Spotify Free because Premium was a luxury I can't afford. Being poor is punishment enough without being taunted by awful features of this app. One album I love I haven't heard in entirety for weeks, as if some songs just aren't available. It shuffles in other artists, and plays songs already set to hidden, then the playlist stops before actual completion and I'm expected to start over with songs I've already listened to? Borderline fascism. Spotify are bullies."
"Disappointing. I turned offline mode on as usual when I purchase a premium, at first it allows me to play my downloaded songs but now I can't even play any song and the offline button is gone. I can't turned it back off, better fix this problems or you will lose all of your users."
"This app really sucks! I don't know what happened but last week, I've been getting these bugs like my liked songs are only playing in 10 seconds and when you exit from the app, it will stop. Also, I can't play my normal playlists without playing it in the shuffle button. This frustrates me."
"As others here have mentioned, the app is quite buggy. Constantly stopping playback for no reason, playbar freezing, and play button refusing to start songs. I'm currently looking for a different streaming service as Spotify refuses to ammend this issue and its gotten to the point where I spend more time fixing the app than listening to my favourite podcasts and music."
Complete trash of an app focused on harvesting data rather than maintaining a functional UI
"Avoid the free version at all costs. They have gone to great lengths to make listening to specific songs impossible. Not only is there no way to turn off shuffle, but spotify will also add similar songs into the mix, forcing you to skip whenever these come on. That is rather annoying by itself, especially when driving or otherwise occupied, but in case that wasn't bad enough, there's of course also a limit on how many times you're able to skip. The design is openly hostile to the user, avoid it."
"Spotify is fine except when ur a free listener. It gives u limited skips, adds random songs to your Playlist, gives u ad after ad after ad, and it just ruins the whole app. I will no longer be using spotify"
"This app is great, the music is great although there is one problem, the app is messed up, like when I try to play the song I try to play it just shuffles to the song I don't even wanna play, it's fricking annoying and it's so annoying I wanna smash my phone so hard just because of the music I wanna play, please add ""Shuffle off"" button so I can shut this thing off, I really wanna play ""Bubble gum"" by Clario."
"""Local"" songs get flagged as unplayable constantly, they dropped support for Kenwood / JVC head units, it uses far more data than it has any right to, syncs terribly and requires a lot of fuffing around to do basic functions. There's not much there worth your time - they've gotten the user base, and now they're complacent and no longer care about making the user experience any good."
Making 1 star until spotify removes their own ads from podcasts. The tone shift completely ruins them.
"Asife from the exorbitant amount of bugs (music not playing, controlling other devices only works half the time, etc.), There's several missing features like a proper shuffle (or a switch for it), themes and proper folder support (how hard can it be? It's already mostly implemented). Also, when playing a radio, the shuffle button isn't shown but it does still apply to the queue."
Recent updates ruined it. 5 ads for every 3 songs
It's good but my problem is you can't play the music that you search properly it's like you play a song you press the play button and sometimes it plays a different music and if you play your playlist you can only play it in shuffle you can't play it the way you intended to and it has ads if you really want to use it without the ads you can play music properly etc then get the premium
Terrible. Seems I can only shuffle songs at random and not listen to the playlists I want. I believe this change is new and it was a bad one. If there is some way to turn this off I still think my review would be low because it is not very intuitive.
"Update: I swear it's like clockwork, every two weeks I have to reinstall because the app breakdown. Does anyone else have this problem? It's ridiculous and I'm getting really sick of it. (Old review) Current Version/Update: is basically unusable. It crashes constantly. I have to open and close it like 5 times before I can get it to even react to my inputs. I'm tired of reinstalling. Worst of all it's making my phone system UI crash too."
"GARBAGE! wouldn't play a single thing for longer than 2 seconds before the whole thing just went away. No ""stopped working"" notification or anything, just POOF. web player audio is all weird, gets loud for a second then quite. Whatta waste of time."
I can't see the play button and I don't want to do random and the new update sucks u need to pay to skip your songs and put they put ads I'm deleting Spotify it trash now. U can't pick the music u want. Spotify is Trashhhhhhhhh
"Absolute buggy mess. Not only does it pause whatever I'm listening to every few minutes, the play button is straight up broken. It plays when you press it, but it's impossible to pause, let alone scrub through the song or podcast. No amount of reinstalling the app or restarting my phone has been able to fix this. The exclusive content isn't worth the headache."
The update sucks now instead of 3 song then 4 ads now is 4ads in every song it's terrible app wasted lost happy moments then ad pops out ruining I freak out scare me every time ene worse if the app nonfiction YOU CAN'T SEND FEEDBACK BECAUSE THEY BLOCKED IT REFUSE TO SEND FEED BACK!!!!!
You guys ruined Spotify. Its awful and not what it used to be. So sad to see another American freedom taken away. Time to go back to pandora.
"I used to love this app because I could choose which songs that I wanted to listen to in my playlist. Now, I'm forced to listen to them all just to get to the song I want to hear. You have ruined this app Spotify, congratulations, now, I will never use this app again."
"The free version of this application is garbage, many artists have gone up and said the amount of money they make off of Spotify isn't a livable amount. (the distribution of how much they pay is the cause of this). Another thing is the first party bot accounts to try to take even more money from the artists. The limited amount skips shouldn't exist with a lack of pay. Another thing is the mid tier UI, the massive amount of advertisements, and non premium quality even with Spotify premium."
This app is so so so so ruined they have to make it so I can at least choose any song I want they can keep any other feature all I want is to play my favorite songs that's all and they have ruined pls make it so you can choose any song you want
UI is just a hide and seek game for me I am using it on Redmi Note 10pro and there are no icons in app even not next track or previous track nothing i just have to guess the position and do things everything is invisible please fix this
This is worst...it shows too many ads..although it shows that after one ad there won't be any ads for the next 30 minutes but if you close the app and reopen it...it will again show you ads..just here to criticize it for being so greedy for earning money by showing ads..whereas ....its primary function is to let us listen song peacefully rather it ruin our mood sometimes by showing irrelevant ads..this app literally forces you to buy their subscription
Easily the worst app experience I've ever had. Every update messing up so many things. UI still confusing and terrible. App isn't registering when I am playing a podcast or song. And randomly stops playing some times.
"Don't download it, not worth it. I'll stick to it until i find something else to listen my music on, they are ruining the free version to rush users into buying premium, basically removing free services just so you buy premium. Maybe if people left even more bad reviews, they might think twice and see what they're doing wrong."
Terrible in app experience. No playlist selection can make up for the UI.
Hard as hell to set up and when ever I use Bluetooth the sound automatically goes to quiet and there's no way to fix it
Song is cutting when we are pressing back button
Since the update I'm having trouble starting up the app. I have to go into settings 4 to 5 times to clear cache but even then when I do get in it still takes awhile for playlists to load and for the play button to work
50% of the time the app crashes when you start a podcast. Genuinely one of the worst apps I've ever used. It just crashes all the time
"I made a playlist specifically dedicated to a game, but theres also songs that spotify automatically adds and theres absolutely no way to disable them, so therefore this absolutely ruins my experience in every single way, shape or form"
"During the birthing throes of the interweb, their was a music algorithym that would tantalize the soul with sounds close to your liking based on the least prompting frim the user. Alas, as moon landing equipment has also become too complex for this now, 126 years later, an arcane and worfully incompetent modern technology couldnt dare venture a decent musical guess. At $13.99. A month. Jesus its trash."
"Spotify had absolutely tanked. Why am I, a paying customer who PAYS for NO ads, GETTING ADS?? What is the point? The app continually glitches, has always given me trouble when I want to download podcasts and just crashes (even after clearing cache, force quitting, and restarting my device). It's absolutley terrible and I really hope they fix this soon or I'm switching back to YouTube once I'm fed up with it."
"Absolute rubbish. Can't play separate songs on my phone but I can in my tablet and computer, automatically adds songs to playlists and you can't take them off, or even see the unwanted songs, have to shuffle through all the unwanted stuff to find your actual playlist, and then has the nerve to remind to edit the playlist. Please change it back to how it was before, or just improve it. Do not download. Spotify has been ruined (especially on a Samsung phone)."
"I miss the shuffle play button, it should be an option for customized playlists."
"I can't replay the song I want to listen, I can't play from a earlier point, and the app randomly shuffles songs which I didn't even ask for. I'm searching to listen to a track, and the app is playing a whole playlist on it's own, and the playlist doesn't even start with my desired song. I also don't find the shuffle on/of button anymore, so I am not being able to turn off shuffle. Dunno what happened, the app was working just fine till yesterday. Anyways, it's annoying me, I'm quitting."
"App is broken. It always plays the wrong song, and you cannot disable shuffle. You might as well change the gui to a giant ""play"" sign, because that's all it is. I wouldn't risk paying these guys for premium if this is their standard of quality."
"7min of music then 5min of ads Says 30min uninterrupted, 15min later more ads. Less ads on regular radio or free tv, the greed of spotify has ruined the app."
Absolutely the worst user experience. If you unwilling to pay for premium don't bother installing. Sure you may have to download your music through another player but at least you can choose a song to play and not be surprised when the thing you wanted to play WILL NEVER PLAY
Why can't I play radio songs? Lol I clicked a song and another started to play what is happening to this stupid app. And add a quick playlist add button. Waste of money.
"It's fun for a while, then suddenly my music playlist gets shuffled and i can't control what i want to listen to. I hate it, very much... It says free but it forces you to buy premium nevertheless. Nice job at ruining a good run."
"Please fix the lock screen functions for this app. Getting tired of having to do my full unlock passcode because it isn't working right after the last update for Android. Lock screen is still messed up, dropped this down to 1 star. Normally it's a full 5 stars for me but no man. Need to be able to quickly access from the locked menu."
"Accidentally tapped on the ""hide Song"" feature in this unintuitive mess of an app, had to navigate through the menu to even see the song to unhide it and it still doesn't play. And Apparently the few minutes on Android take seniority over years of desktop use because I literally can't reverse it on my PC without it saying I have to do that via the Android app."
ITS VERY BAD LIKE DONT EVEN PAY IT I PAYED SPOTIFY A LOT JUST TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND NOW THAT I QUIT GIVING IT MONEY IT JUST STOLE IT THERE AINT EVEN OPTIONS WHERE YOU CAN DISABLE THIS LIKE FR SPOTIFY? YOU JUST TOOK MY 149 PHP WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME i want refund spotify pls reply to this i could spend all that money to buy me some food :( also premium sucks why wont it let me change plans? or cancel them? pls fix this
Could pay more to the artists. They somehow ruined the remote group session feature.
"This app is ruined now. I pay a subscription for the app to randomly crash, songs to play with no sound and have to be restarted. I listen most days and I can't remember the last time I played a play list and didn't have to unlock my phone to restart the app or go back on to figure out why the music stopped."
"I dont like the latest update the songs that I want to play is now shuffle with different kind of music (though I dont even like the music that playing randomly) also, I can't rewind the song and the other button has been missing like the 'add to que' and other :( I now can't play my fav music cause of shuffle"
"Now playing screen on the tab s7 plus is only using half of the screen in landscape orientation, causing all of the buttons to be squished together and difficult to use. This UI issue has been going on for about a month now. Please fix!"
"Used to be great. Bring back the separate play and shuffle play buttons, it's such a pain realising you've hit shuffle. Having to turn off loads of features just to keep your sanity sucks. Auto mixing, playing similar music once an album or playlist has finished shouldn't be on my default. Stop changing things for the sake of it. This should be about playing music, not working out how to turn off a new dumb feature. I know companies your size won't act on a person's review or even reply,"
"Every time I accidently remove liked songs from the button inside the player. Please add a double check removal to that like button as well. Edit: it seems iOS has no like button at the bottom, so perhaps remove it as well for android? Sadly still the same :/"
Please make a shortcut during the songs to add it quickly to your playlists instead of searching for them and add it manually
My phone got restart when I open Spotify. Please resolve it quickly
"You NEED a subscripction to choose a song and there UI makes it impossible to listen to 1 song, and if your playlists has under 15 songs without the subscription THEY ADD SONGS YOU DONT WANT they make it like an EA game"
"Pretty good, but just no. The ""playing suggested songs"" is such a nigthmare + you can't skip much because you are limited to skips too. Just please remove ""Playing Suggested Songs"", it's not really helpful and just ruins everything."
I hope Spotify will fix the design when it's about to upload to instagram story. The design's horrible enough to look at.
Installed this on my phone today. It won't allow me to login to my account! I am getting a head ache now from too many attempts to fix this. Really disappointed. Uninstalling the app from my phone and smart watch. Never had an experience like this from other music apps. Now it's saying i can't login due to too many attempts. I even changed my password. Thanks a lot for ruining my pre workout mood. I would have bought a premium version if there was one.
Customer service is appalling. I am getting charged for two accounts and have tried to enquire multiple times without success
"The app posts pro-US war propaganda in something called the ""information hub"" telling me to support the US military and allies. I used to live in a refugee building with people who had families killed and homes destroyed by the US, including children. I think it's stupid for a music app to support violence and jingoism."
"Worst experience ever. The UI is difficult, downloads dont download. I got this thinking I could put music on my phone but all I got was a headache and a monthly bill that took my like a solid 20 mins to figure out how to unsubscribe from."
This app is terrible It had login problem and I couldn't login into the app after alot of trying I finally loggined and it is not work properly I can't even play a song and it play another song I can't use next and prevoius button it was the worst app I have ever seen in my life
The recent update put the pause button all the way to the left of the screen along with the skip back and forward button. The skip back and forward button are right next to each other and very small. How can one expect not to click the wrong button. Who thought that would be a good idea?!
Please return the shuffle button for daily playlists
Now playing bar keeps disappearing at random. Requires me to force stop and reopen app
Why does this App play random songs when all I want is my liked songs? The arrogance is staggering. Terrible user interface. Three button taps just to repeat the current song?
This app keeps on taking me to other songs i dkn't even want to watch when₩ i press the play button it plays another song please fix this!
The app is just bad. Glitchy and unintuitive and has been for a decade. Good luck if you like podcasts.
"I can't set the timestamp, I play the song I want but it plays a different one, loop and shuffle button doesn't even show bruh. Horrible I guess."
Below average 1) Not great collection 2) UI one of the worst 3) Someone logged from other device & then forget password link just not working. Last but not least they never bothered to reply.
Can only play a preview of my liked songs and it's the same in any playlist I make and if I want to hear a full song then I can only press the shuffle button and hope.
"I used to love this app. but now you've completely ruined the experience with your updates and re-crafting. It's complete and total garbage now. If your trying to shed users, to go to a pay to play format, you've only half the formula right."
"Reinstate the song preview button, the removal of the feature is impractical and pointless."
"You may still get ads with a premium account. My downloaded songs cut in and out. The pause play button doesn't always pop up when a song is selected, even after restarting the app."
"Annoying!!! Please move it back how it was or make it better. I can't just pick the song I want from my list, I have to skip other songs to get what I want. It just plays the song for about 10s, you can see the circle spinning and goes back to the one I was listening previously. Annoying!!! Again. What did you do? It took my a while to figure it out how to make it work. It's not intuitive at all... Will change my review after it's fixed, please make it good. But now, I'm annoyed."
Constant problems but when there aren't any problems it works great. I would like to suggest to have a button that sorts the playlists by genre
"Spotify does A/B testing all the time. It's unfortunate I fell under it and now have to see the ugliest UI in the history where play button is on left and previous/next button is in middle of nowhere. I really hope the UI designer stops talking the ""stuff"" and do not screw the working UI"
The play/pause bar has been going missing for months. Nothing done by tech. Playing downloaded songs requires changing setup to off-line playback. That's dumb. Its because I don't have internet access then that's why I'm playing only downloaded songs. Switching back and forward is tiresome within the app. Needs a do-over. I just want to play music and not get annoyed by the app.
"Horrible, it adds songs thay i dont want in my playlist to my playlist, i just want to fricking draw while listening to music but spotify adds songs that ruin the playlist and im sick and tired of it, the only version that doesnt do this is on computer, but what if i dont want to go on my computer? Im not going to just sit around while this piece of junk adds songs that i dont want into my playlist."
crashes after a few seconds whenever i try to open any other apps. doesn't play stuff at all quite often
"Sure it has infinate free music. But for every song there is at least 3 ads. It wasnt always this way but now it is. Instead it used to go ""click her to 30 minutes of ad free music"" but now those ads dont exsist so ur stuck with the 3 for every song. Also your ""liked songs playlist""? Completely useless. U can go to it and press shuffle play, but will it play the songs that u pressed the like button on? Nooo. It plays songs u have never heard of. Like seriously wth is that. So find a diffrent app"
"When I open the app and click the play button for Playing a song, the app has crashed. Annoying..."
"Honestly, one of the worst UI for a major app. Always been terrible and probably will always be terrible."
"Hellllooooo Spotify? When are you going to fix the disappearing ""now playing,"" button. I'm paying for a subscription but the app on Android is almost totally useless. Ridiculous that you haven't got this fixed yet."
All of my playlists disappeared after my phone updated. What the hell? It took me years to build those playlists. If I can't get them back I am canceling my subscription. Spotify has not been functioning the way it should for months and this is the last straw. I'm done.
Why the near constant pop up for Bluetooth access??? Does the app not understand when denied once? Why do I give Bluetooth access when I am playing off of my phone speakers?? What nonsense is this? Maybe Spotify team needs to focus on making the song suggestion algorithm better instead of needlessly ruining the UI. Apple music is better.
"This app doesn't work on my Mobile Internet and whenever I'm outside my home, this app totally stops working and when I use it on WiFi, it works good. I thought firstly my phone has problem but later on got to know some of my friends are having the same issue. It's happening from like 3 days now, better solve the issue quickly"
"I hate this app. I try to make an alarm for myself to songs I like because I am a heavy sleeper and it plays random songs that are super quiet. I can't take the songs out and this app just sucks for this reason because it doesn't even allow you to only have your Playlist. I rate this app a 1-5 for this reason because I have been late many times for this reason. Thank you Spotify, never downloading you again"
"Best streaming library, worst UI. Been hopping the last year or so between all the big services and I've landed back here. I'm still disgusted at this interface. Nothing about this is intuitive. I miss the old ui. The AI sucks. If it weren't for the fact that Spotify has wormed its way into integrating with EVERYTHING, I would not use it. Wish I could turn podcasts off."
"""Premium"" user experience: -You can't block your followers and spotify is refusing to add this feature FOR 10 YEARS. -UI is horrible and it gets worse with EVERY update. Screens are bigger and bigger and it's hard to reach top of the screen with one hand. What spotify is doing? They move important things to the top of the screen. -Also you can't customize anything. -External equalizers don't work properly - Search bar randomly stops working"
What the hell is this new update it's abosulty awful. The UI is confusing I cannot even listen to a specific song.
It's getting worst with every update. I have been using Spotify since real long but now with every update the quality and ui is degrading. It makes no sense to put all these weekly/monthly updates. It's buggy and crashes all the time. So disappointed. New Spotify relies more more on the internet. So what's the point of getting smooth offline premium features.
This so sux I can't even play the liked video if I click it's going to change idk it's bug but I think it's not so don't download this. This app so super ultra sux app
"For the love of god, add an option to disable lyrics or at least make it a button. The amount of times I try to swipe to the next song and the lyrics come sliding up is insane."
"This is my favorite app when it comes to listening music, but recently, whenever i press the play button, spotify automatically stops and back to homescreen. Please fix it!"
Such a nuisance app.. not at all user friendly for Android users! The commands are soo complicated when they can be soooo easy.. Example1.. A link shared on what's app.. if clicked doesn't open that song.. instead still plays the old one opened earlier. Example2.. there is no easy option to close a song or album!
"Stupid constant emails, annoying pop ups, can't dislike anything so you keep getting the same stupid recommendations. Fed up getting ads disguised as suggestions in the paid version. Sick of my ""top mixes"" having nothing in common with anything i ever listen to."
"Such a frustratingly slow user experience, especially poor when you are offline (even with offline mode on). Often when playing songs or podcasts app will just stop (or be displaying that a different song is playing). I love Spotify on my computer but frankly astonished at the poor user experience on Android."
"Great app! But it keeps playing different songs everytime I play a specific song. Honestly, it ruined the whole experience for me. Deleting this app until they make some changes."
"2 songs at most before on average 3-5 adds in a row, than you can't pick a specific song you want to listen to, it's a random choice not what you want, the only good thing that this has between the other versions is you can have a quick listen instead of playing the whole song and making daily mix give you dumb songs"
"The new update is the worst update ever. I try making a Playlist with only a few songs and Spotify automatically adds songs to the recommendation list, I try getting rid of them but they won't stop adding. They also got rid of the repeat button for non premium users. I've been with Spotify for about 5 years and now I'm done."
Paid for premium and can't play a damn single music. Keeps on crashing after pressing the play button. What an app. Will give zero star if there was an option.
After last update the app is crashing if i press play button and i saw many people facing same issue and they posted in Spotify community and it works fine when I install previous versions .
Malfunctions all the time. 1) have to force stop all the time since pause button disappears 2) sometimes just stops altogether 3) sometimes stops mid podcast and starts an entirely different one Awesome stuff. Fix it maybe?
"I'm just loving the random crashing and restarts of the app. hey, at least they finally have a sleep timer though. Update: now they moved 'recently played' off the 'home' landing page and stuck it under 'your library'. I hope the brain trust that made that move enjoyed their avacodo toast and soy latte as they pat themselves on the back for that brilliant decision. STOP FUDGING WITH UI AND STICK TO FIXING BUGS!!! Update 05June2022; Recent update has now resulted in even MORE crashes.Awesome job"
"Not the worst but quite bad, sometimes one wants to only listen to the things they like, yet sometimes the app will ""recommend"" and will force you to listen to said ""recommendations"" and if you skip them, then it takes up the already limited skips one already have, so that is quite annoying, and also, whenever there is an ad, they will multiply by three so instead of one I have to listen to three ads before going back to my music. So yeah not the worst thing in the world but quite bad"
"After the latest update, app is crashes as soon as I play any song. As soon I hit play button it closes on its own."
"I usually play the ""Daily Drive"" playlist, which contains music numbers and news plus other podcasts. I hate football and it still plays ""FC Afkicken"" podast. Why isn't there a button to dislike/block stupid podcasts like unliked sports!?"
"u can't even play a certain song that u want. instead it just plays a preview of the song u picked, but it never play it like as a whole. u can't play individual songs on a playlist without hitting the shuffle button. i hope you bring back the previous version because this update is so bad."
Terrible! Plays the same songs over and over...does not shuffle ever. Skips songs with out me pressing the button. Plays the same songs ive heard just hours before opening app again.
Just quit the download and delete it many times and restart it many times please tell me how to do
Today I wanted to create a party playlist on my Samsung tab s7 and Spotify failed miserably with at least a few major bugs and more design failures. There is a bug when the playhead isn't visible most of the time and it is almost impossible to scrub. There is a bug that my girl wasn't able to join the playlist. There is a bug that downloaded songs are not shown. Let alone that the whole UX is not adapted for a tablet and very miserable. Wth are you peeps doing up in Sweden? Sleepin on laureates.
"Everything is great and I love this app but the only problem is that something when I open soptify my search list is delete which for me is so so so annoying because it's not like everytime they decide to delete it I will search back all the songs again,I do that because I can't remember a pesefic song at that time. It has been happening to me for quite some time.I know this will not change a thing but I just wanted to know if it happens to any of you"
I don't know what the problem is. but suddenly the pause/play button slides to the left.
Most retarded UI switch in human history - they changed the arrangements of the Buttons (from skip - play/pause - skip to play/pause - skip - skip) Someone deserves a special place in hell
I cant search for a specific song anymore. Keeps trying to push new music. And ads!!! Ads ruin this world
"Even when I'm paying for it I still get pop up ads. Frick off Also, the tv app is truly terrible. No playback speed control, overly simplified UI, reduced options to choose in the home page, almost no ability to look at previously played, search function is clumsy. Seems designed at showing you their recommendations and the most popular/highest paying of your recent listens, but not chronologically. Garbage design for users, I'm about to quit. Winamp 25 years ago had better functionallity."
When I was creating my account at the end when I setted password and email I tapped on create account they said it was an error then told me to change my password after I changed my password they said that the password and email is not suitable combined together at that point I got annoyed and deleted the app and even though I created an account the first time it all got deleted and I had to make a second account but it didn't worked hope that it will not happen again when I download it again
"I have come to a realization on why everyone chooses SoundCloud over yall, and it's the simple fact that every action is a premium action. Like if I want to pick this one song to play, I can't cuz it just plays a preview and never the song. You have to get lucky so that the random play button picks that 1 song out of 100s. And skipping, OH MY GOD.... 6 skips an hour, are yall just advertising that you can only pay to enjoy. I'd rather stick with SoundCloud they are much friendlier to use as well"
"I'm currently considering on cancelling my subscription, cause it's currently up to almost no use.. the app is pretty slow, lagging quite a few times and listening to music sometimes just takes ages. It's just frustrating. There are moments when it's working perfectly fine and five minutes later it's bugging again.. if there aren't any changes, I'm leaving Spotify for good.. I loved the app some years ago, now I'm really close to hating it, especially when you're paying for the premium version"
"Worst app. Can not play any song. When touch the play button, nothing played. 👎👎👎👎"
I liked it at first but the new update ruined it theres swearing song in my clean playlist please get rid of this update and i might do a 5 star review
"💩 Poor service... Bunch of lairs and thieves... Where is my three months free subscription, what's up with technical glitches and messed shuffle button"
"Your app is genuinely pathetic. It takes multiple minutes to load a simple playlist, even on desktop. Be thankful you have no real competition, because you wouldn't last a week if you did."
Please get the shuffle button on playlists back
The play button is now on the left side of the screen instead of the centre like every other music player in existence and there is no way to change it back.
It was actually great at first but then the 6th day i used this app there's only shuffle button and when u clicked it it's playing song i actually don't like wth this app is the worst
"Needs to be more stable and empowering for user. Excellent and ever improving library. Absolutely terrible client software. This app pauses crashes and buffers more than it should even on locally stored files (Android). Spotify searching and exploration is great when you follow the suggestions less so when you have an idea. The discovery feature is great but it's not enough to account for the bad playback ,gui and organization. I was hesitant to use paid music streaming and now I know why."
"Nov 2021 update screwed everything up. What you want while driving is small buttons, distrating cover art and lyrics, makes driving more dangerous. They remove the best thing, android car view and keep screen on, so constantly unlocking your phone is dangerous. You can no longer safely skip songs while driving. Buttons are so tiny and unresponsive 0 stars. Update 6 months and many update later. UI still bad while driving"
Can't turn shuffle off easily in tablet. Can you fix this please? UI shouldn't be this difficult
Every now and then the play button does not appear so I can not stop the song and I end up having to uninstall the app. So annoying considering I'm a premium customer. I wonder if this happening to others? Please get it sorted.
I can't listen to anything because the play button doesn't actually work but it will play randomly and then stop randomly and you cannot press any buttons because the app doesn't think it's playing anything..... and this is on premium... you want people to pay money for this?
Hate the offset play button all the way on the left...
Stop removing music. Also I have issues with this app and the desktop app litterally everyday and you keep giving obscene amounts of money to Podcasters and for like a solid year the video playback was insufferable and still kind of is. I'm incredibly sick of how bad spotify is. Absolutely awful UI 5/26/22 they gave me a survey to fill out but I accidently pressed the back key and it's just gone now. I would've liked to've done it Having issues with local files now. 5/31 desktop app wont launch
"Finally the scroll button is back, yay, it's a good job really because the skip is also back. When you are playing a list and steaming to a device if you pause the song or walk out of the room with your phone, when you return and continue the last song then when that one ends, it skips back to the start of the list but then plays a totally random song. I'm trying to work out which song it skips back to, think it may be the last one downloaded to my phone. So still not happy"
I hate you so much I can't tap on my favorite song and play it and it keep playing stupid suggested songs and there's no delete button I hate it 1 star
Somehow I lost the enhanced button. Won't come back after logging out clearing data and cache.
"Pretty much non-functional now. Won't download songs, crashes, requires many restarts to even begin playback, will randomly stop playback during songs, will skip playlists at random, plays ads even when paying for premium (supposedly ad-free - lies), etc. It's sad - used to be a great music streaming app, but it appears they've forgotten their main purpose - to play music."
"The UI is amazing. The font is just beautiful, the library is large enough that I'm not missing any songs. My only complaint is the regional restrictions on music, I need my anime songs. Edit: Changing my 5 stars to 1 Bring back the shuffle button."
"Poor application with potential , the ads after every song ruin it , on top of the add they waste another 15 seconds telling us that they're giving us 30 minutes of listening ad free ."
"Absolutely terrible! Toooo many ads! Pls opt for other apps, they have fewer apps with better UI"
Will not play anything. I would give it 0 stars if i could as it doesn't even do what it is literally designed to do. What is going on?
"In the beginning spotify was amazing, genuinely 5 star experience with the podcasts, selection of music, and UI. The reason I gave a 1 star is because now that I have an issue with the UI, everything else struggles with it. I can't even watch podcasts in full screen and the music player icon panel is always pushed together like it has a phone aspect ratio. Which doesn't make sense because it worked perfectly before on my tablet. And yes I tried resetting, removing cache, but no help. Please fix"
Bring back playlist song previews!! I don't understand why this feature was removed but not having it makes making playlists extremely difficult. It has genuinely reduced how much i use the app because i cannot find new music anymore. even with the Spotify playlists and song radios every song is something that I've already hear. Defeats the purpose of using an app like Spotify if can't even find new music
Its crashing whenever i tap the play button the app closes automatically
When I click play button. The app crashes. Please help me to rectify the issue. I verified with the other apps. Other music apps works perfectly.
"As a paying user, i find the app underwhelming. Bad android experience for a popular app. Very buggy. Always stop playing after few minutes when tablet locks. Im only using it coz it has all my fave podcast. But as an app, i feel that they could care a lot more on the interface and user experience as a whole. It needs a revamp. Do not sit on your laurels and bank only on the vast catalogs. PLEASE SPOTIFY, I want to love you, but your app disappoints more often than not."
It keeps closing when i pressed play button.
the app keep closed down when i paly the music. previously quite okay. The problems happened since yesterday. Please fix it ASAP!
Hate the new update. Why'd you change the shuffle button? SMH Disappointing. Will be considering unsubscribing.
The contoller at the bootom is not visible. I dont have the pause or next buttons. May 30 problem is the same
"Ok music app, but the music is not very loud, lacks punch, i have to have my phones volume up nearly full, needs some sort of volume booster built in like Vradio player, and the app now is full of ads, which makes it basically unusable."
Problem after updated. When clicking the button play..apps shutdown. Pls solve this problem even i pay ready.
Everytime I click the play button the app crashes.please fix this asap
Cannot play any song now. The app keep turning off every time when hitting the play button.
The app updated recently and now the app crashes when the play button is clicked. Please do check on this issue.
"The app has now removed basic features which such as the rewind button and only allow 6 skips an hour. Ads pop up after every 1 to 2 songs and now when I select a skng it plays another one, the only way to disable the shuffle button is to get premium which is really annoying as not everyone can pay for that please fix this"
"Honestly spotify, what on God's green earth are you up to? Why did you remove the feature where i can pre-listen to songs before i add them to a playlist? Like, why? I understand making your app as frustrating as possible for non-premium users to force us to pay but this change was so unnecessary and has now made my life on the app 100% more difficult. I just want to check the song I'm adding is the right one! Thanks for ruining your app unnecessarily. Gone back to YouTube now."
Issues with skipping are bad enough now song radios don't always include the song it's building a radio station on...
"Normally, I would give this app a 5 star rating, but I'm not sure what's going on; I can't listen to my playlists without it playing on shuffle, and the button to turn it off is missing; whenever I open the app, it crashes as soon as I play music; and I'm not sure if it's just my phone, but it makes for a very unpleasant listening experience."
The last time i updated this app. It crashes everytime i press the play button. It doesn't play the song. It always exits everytime i play a song. Will you please fix this? I am on a PREMIUM ACCOUNT and I don't deserve this kind of service. Thank you.
"why tf can't i play my music? when i press the play button, it crashes. Currently redownloading it and see if it works. Confused and dissappointed af. update: still doesnt work and im really dissappointed. Just gonna stick to youtube."
Getting crashed when press the play button in vivo X80
"This version just collapse when i press play button. First starts the ad and immediately collapses. I do like this app, but unfortunately I need to use another app. Let me know what must have gone wrong."
"Going to stop paying for this service.... The mobile app is absolutely terrible. So many silly little bugs, with play/pause, displaying what song is playing, doesn't even show up in my notification bar anymore for quick song change..... My next payment will bounce, sorry not sorry. Fix your rubish app or I won't come back....."
Please update the play button at music it hard to play the music if i don't know how to use it
The new update sucks I have been using this app for 5 month's and it's ruined when you guys added the new update when I tap shuffle on my playlists song it only plays a new different song and it's irritating me plus there has been a lot of adds in this app even tho I bought premium it still have a lot of ads I'm uninstalling this app if you guys don't fix the problem in Spotify.
"Broken beyond repair in the last Android update. Worked absolutely fine till 2 days ago! Oh, the Agony! Hope they fix it quickly"
"Hi Spotify team, FYI : Some time back I use to like Chand Baliya song, after listening to your aggressive advertising spaces, I am feeling pukish about the song , but Mr.Aditya the singer 👨‍🎤 🎤 you have ruined your status because of this over aggressive marketing efforts. I am sorry for my shrewd comments, but its time to improvise. Cheers 🍻👏"
Frustrating unnecessary issues. Can't view an artist's songs and add the ones you want to a playlist without Spotify adding songs from other artists to the list you're choosing from after each selection you make. It's constantly on in the background waiting to play a song and can't be turned off so if you accidentally tap play on your headphones Spotify is going to start playing - and for some reason it always plays the same song I randomly listened to weeks ago. Poor user experience.
Give me back my shuffle good God why are you making me shuffle it myself when I had a perfectly good button to spam?????
"Just now I installed the app . I select the and I pressed the play button, the app automatically closed, it is repeating again and again ."
How is this taking more wifi for audio only while YouTube when running audio only takes far less wifi to listen to in the background??? You guys need to hire someone to optimize your code because holycow the wifi usage it requires has the podcast CHUG! It's not even as if the audio is any better than YouTube!
I.hate.the.new.update. When I play my playlist I can't even pick what song I wanted to hear first but it will quickly shuffle!! Instead of relaxing listening to music it makes me frustrated even more!!!... Hope you can fix it!!
One of the most useful features: the enhance button has suddenly dissapeared. Tried everything from the Spotify forum.... kinda sad.
"App is awful and broken. Podcasts randomly stop, also can no longer use skip/play/stop because the neccessary buttons no longer show up. Have to force close the entire App if I want to pause anything."
"Frankly speaking I recieved more than 3 ads in just 5 minutes It's not Spotify I guess It's ""ad""ify even your share button doesn't work"
this app is genuinely bad on purpose and throws 3 minute ads at you every 10 minutes 💀 it can't even properly play songs i add to a playlist it's permanently on shuffle and plays stuff i did not add to it
"So disappointed with Spotify. I'm a premium user. I'm having so many issues recently. I'm absolutely fed up! It's getting worse. I cannot get it to stop shutting down , it is happening many times during the course of a podcast/song, I rarely get the bar/arrow at the bottom and most of the time I have little control over the play button. Downloaded/online stuff doesn't even work.Constantly having to close the app and restart. SPOTIFY PLEASE RESPOND WITH A SOLUTION!"
"I might have to stop using this app. The battery drain is so severe that I can't use it when out of the house and not near a charger. The terrible UX for my library is an ongoing issue too, but I can deal with that if the battery drain wasn't so ridiculous. Currently on s21 ultra."
"Dear Spotify, Why did the 'remove from recently played' button removed? I let my playlist on autoplay the other day and accidentally it played something weird. It's embarrassing especially when you purchase shared account. PLEASE BRING BACK THE REMOVE FROM RECENTLY PLAYED BUTTON or GIVE US SUBSCRIBER AN OPTION TO CLEAR OUR HISTORY FOR THE SAKE OF PRIVACY. Hope you resolve this ASAP. Overall everything is actually fine. Might as well rate 5 stars but I'm rating 1 stars because of that issue."
"Why is it like this?! Im frustrated! I just want to play a specific song and everytime i search, it shows a play button with a ahuffle on the bottom and when i tap it, it will play another song, not the song i wanted to play! Why sis you turn the spotify into that? This is so frustrating."
Went to play an album and pressed the play button but it played the next item in the queue. This really doesn't work for me. Also I want to be able to sort podcasts by oldest or newest.
"removed the option to play samples when adding new music to playlists, this makes ot so awkward and genuinely annoying to make playlists now"
"As if the app wasn't bad enough they have now taken away the feature of previewing songs before you add them to a playlist, this ruins the reach of their artist and the discovery of their audience. Horrible app that makes foolish decisions honestly not worth getting anymore."
They must have done an update; ruined my ability to listen to my music on bluetooth. I might just cancel my account. There are others like amazon i will try out.
Nah the offline ones are even better. I hate it. I can't even skip more than 6 times per hour. Bruh. When ur on a ph1 u can't put a song on a play list to play and u can't skip to find it. Now I have to wait 1 hour to hear a song I like. PLUS WHY DO U PUT ADDS? what's the point? There's a whole button for premium to click and if I wanted premium I would buy. BUT NO U HAVE TO PUT ADDS THERE! Bruh annoying. Offline music w/out premium >>>>>>>>>>😐😐
"Cancellation is purposely designed to be very hard. There is no direct link, even when you get to cancellation, you have to go through 3-4 screen, each screen giving you an impression that it's cancelled. However there is a tiny button at the bottom which usually you have to scroll to see, because their offers take most of the screen space. They do con people into paying another month of subscription, however they lose lifetime business of someone like me."
"The ui sucks, it's so goddamn annoying it feels like your trying to chase down a loose pet or wrangle a wild animal just to play the song you want and nothing feels clear the only benefit is you can listen to whatever you want so long as you have the patience to wait through 5 other songs or waist your little skips"
"Geez you guys are so desperate for money, i cant play the songs i want without you having to keep the damn playlist of shuffle, i can never get to the right song with skip cause we only have 6, i get about 5 ads ever 2 songs, and then you start to play other songs that wernt even in the playist to Begin with, and so much more. The app was good at first untill you had to ruin it by trying to force us to get premium by making the app even more shittier ever update money stealing bastards"
Every update makes this app progressively worse. They've just deprecated the ability to preview songs. This is a core function of building a play list. Maybe spend less on Joe rogan and more on basic UX
"Awful, full of flaws. Terrible UI. Even worse algorithm when trying to suggest you songs."
Your app sucks even shuffle button making it force to buy premium the hecki rather play music in yt music i dont care if its not like Spotify where you listen even if its turned off atleast i can listen my favorite music WITHOUT SHUFFLING SUCH A GREEDY
"If you search a single song, you have to choose a playlist it's put together where the song you want to listen to is 4 songs in. But you can't skip to it because you have limited skips, which was clearly designed with this ""play a bunch of unrelated music first"" to force you into premium. 4 ads that are 15-30 seconds each to listen to 1-2 songs then ads again, even when it tells you get 30 minutes of free listening, it plays ads next song again. So much more that won't fit. Spotify sucks."
"Dumb app. How are you gonna recommend a new single from a band to me, then when I click to play it, it plays a song from a different band. Many other issues, entire app seems unintuitive."
This is stupid. I can't play any song on the app individually. When I click the button it just gives a preview. You cannot play any song when you look it up. I tried creating a playlist but that didn't work. I liked it and that didn't work. Does anyone have a fix?
"""Hide"" button doesn't work. I don't recommend an application that doesn't work decently! Not to mom or anyone. Asking 10 times to allow Bluetooth connectivity is really annoying! Seriously, testing this app before releasing any update should help 🙃 Useless... even worse! 😡 Going back to Limewire."
"If you don't pay for premium the user experience is poop. Like imagine not being able to skip to your favorite part of a song?? If you can find your songs in a different, more user friendly app and don't want to spend money every month, you are better off using that instead tbh"
I dont want Spotify anymore the extra song ruined my day
"Player keeps disappearing, so you can't pause or skip or do anything, the only way to stop a podcast/music is by force quitting the app. It's a mediocre podcast player but I'm forced to use it because some of my favourite podcasts are now Spotify exclusive"
"I really hate shuffle button, pls add the button of turning on and off shuffle whyyyyyyyyyyy"
"From 5 to 1 star, due to the latest update. The play button MUST be in the center."
"just another branch of big tech willing to censor any view they don't like. the ""covid"" warning is absurd often showing up when someone says something true in a podcast but is against a certain narrative. a recent update has made the ui infuriating. now going from one podcast to another requires significantly more time and effort. often giving me a ""no internet connection"" for minutes with a completely black screen the whole time. preventing me from playing downloaded files...."
Cant skip music after latest update. The new UI is not functional. Do you even test new versions on existing devices? Can't even shuffle or unshuffle the player anymore. The latest update destroyed it.. and no im not using some unsupported android device. Im on the newest Samsung tablet
I like it but when I click add songs and play a song to see if it's good you know like get a little sample of it it doesn't work anymore the play button just disappeared and now I can't get a little sample of the song
"If you ain't paying, the app is quickly not worth using"
"Good for playing podcast, BAD for playing music. Literally, why block the ""previous"" button, along with not being able to play a specific song unless i get premium. Also one more thing, ABSOLUTELY STOP ADDING MORE MUSIC TO A PLAYLIST, WHATS ON THERE SHOULD BE THERE."
"Spotify home screen is cluttered with useless features. One example is ""Jump back in"" - the music shown here has little to do with I like to listen, and music that I accidentally played tend to stick around a long time. Spotify UI team should re-learn 'less is more.'"
"Shuffle as default is RIDICULOUS! It does not matter if you touch the big green play button (I know this is a shuffle button, but seriously, shuffle should be user option NOT default) or if you select the first song in your play list. You still need to open the first song and turn shuffle off to play in order. I have invested in PREMIUM service! Extremely frustrating especially in the car!!! Please fix this glitch. This is a big reason for going premium and now it is useless!"
Yo who thought up the new layout with the play/pause button all the way to the left and the forward-reverse buttons next to each other? Whatever you're smoking or snorting you gotta get rehab cause that high-idea wasn't a good one. It's a terrible layout and I can't revert back.
"WHERE IS MY ENCHANCED PLAYLIST BUTTON??? a month ago i cannot find my now playing button , i love spotify but now it is very buggy , too bad i might move to deezer soon"
"A once great product has become unusable and has shown its true colours by refusing to fix its issues quickly. Originally thought the problem was my connect, but this evidently is not the case."
"I know I'm using free, but if I added songs to a playlist, it makes sense that the songs played will be those I added. I'd ask for a random song button if I wanted literally any song that is not in my playlist."
It's a wonderful app with a very good algorithm but it's full of bugs. The pause button goes to the left and the next and previous buttons stay together. Every time I have to log out to fix it. And when the buttons aren't like that the lyrics just disappear. I can't listen to the sample sometimes too. And like others said the the playing now bar don't shows the music. It's terrible!!
Requires update every day and still doesnt work properly.
The pause button is on the left side and the skip buttons are in the middle... It looks terrible and I hope this bug will be fixed soon
"Can't pause or advance music on app.“Now Playing"" and the control buttons disappear most of the time. I've been using Spotify for years but this issue makes it frustrating to use and ruins the experience."
bad position for the playback button... its ugly!!! hope the dev read this issue and return the original...
So finally on the way to ruin the app... Good developers.. What's happening! See there are a lot of other alternatives we can easily switch to other apps.. its about a month i am seeing app to be laggy sometimes blank and in web version lyrics to be synced wrongly for all songs..
"The UI is degrading, it's becoming so terrible. Especially so on pc!! Please allow for more customization of the UI. Perhaps an option to return it to legacy. Just somebody do something!"
"I love the service of Spotify, but please @spotify-devs: why is this app so hard to use without or with bad internet connection - For downloaded playlists and podcast it takes forever to load and the whole ui responds so badly... Seems not like a complicated thing to fix, but is like that for a long time"
RUINED BY THE LAST UPDATE. HORRIBLE. My playlists no longer only play my saved songs. Random songs and music play when I only want to hear my chosen songs. Fix it Spotify I can't live without music it keeps me actually alive. There is no way I can mentally handle your company choosing my music. FIX IT PLEASE ITS HORRIBLE I NEED MY MUSIC TO STAY ALIVE. THE APP RANDOMLY CLOSES NOW AND CHOOSES ITS OWN MUSIC. I won't be on this planet for long with it this way. HORRIBLE.
"I've used Spotify for years, but tried downloading it on mobile and it's just awful. I'm sorry to say it but it's just plain awful. It only lets me play songs of my choice for about 5 seconds before shuffling to recommended songs, not only that, but I can't find the repeat and shuffle buttons. I'm sorry but this doesn't even work, just use the web version instead, cause Spotify is still an excellent music provider, just not here on Google play"
Yall lost two of my accounts and won't let me sign in to either of them because they don't exist because I didn't use it for 2 days? 2 DAYS AND MY ACCOUNT IS LOST. I spent 2 hours making Playlist that I liked and you ruined it for me because yall can't keep your accounts straight. On top of that the ads are so annoying and you only get 30 minute without them which is like no time compared to the time songs take. This whole thing annoys me and I literally hate it now. GET my account back.
"My Repeat button just completely disappeared and I try updating the app and more, but nothing works. I'm done with this app."
"Too much, not intuitive for me"
"I wanted to reinstall the app (it was working weirdly together with another player installed) and deleted it. Now it says the app is not available for my device. Turns out I paid for premium so that I won't have ads in my NO MUSIC and could skip between any of NO TRACKS. Why thank you, well worth it, 0/10. Coincidentally I can't even buy a new phone easily because someone brainfarted when designing esim tech and it's harder to transfer esim to a new phone then a physical sim card - and I would have to go to another country for that. My experience could not be worse."
My play button has moved to the left of the screen and the skip and back button is rearranged. Dumb design please put it back to the original
Had to change my review from 5 to 1. Despite having data it simply can't read it. It says requires network connectivity. The paid version sucks too. To search a song it takes eternity. Fix your stupid app spotify.
Play/Forward/Backwards buttons are messed up again. Play is now far left. It makes no sense and nothing has worked to move the Play button back to centre. Extremely annoying!
"Been a premium subscriber for quite a while now,cant live without it. Sadly the last update has made it near impossible to listen to music on my Android phone, with crashes and far slower load times. Edit: a year later and still problems. Going to move on from spotify as they can't seem to fix the app or there desktop program. Was nice for a while."
"I don't know why would anyone without a subscription would download the version for mobile. It's absolutely fill to the brim with ads, it's impossible to use playlists and it feels literally designed to NOT be used without a subscription. The aggressive marketing is the core driven of the mobile version and a slap to the face for any user. This is one of the many good reasons that keep me from buying a subscription or supporting Spotify in any way. Don't install it."
"whatever this new update is, it is way less user friendly than before. i cant check to see if the songs are the ones im thinking of, bc you removed the quick listen feature, and why rearrange the buttons? its already super difficult not paying for premium, no need to make it worse..."
Play control buttons keep disapearing
"Horrible UIh too much clutter, not enough working parts. Paid for premium. Still getting ads and can't listen to the downloaded content. Hard to navigate through the clutter to find what I'm searching for. The app need to be more simplified."
"Before , Spotify was a great app ,but the new update just ruined it, the randomiser song just made me angry"
Why the heck is the music control button aligned to the left?? This is messed up my muscle memory and less convenient for right handed user! Please revert the changes or at least make an option to choose which layout to use in the settings menu.
"Needs better UI and UX design for easier, faster, and more effective thumb tapping on the screen while holding phone. And more options being easily accessible."
How to seek forword and shuffle? Many other problem with user experience.
Is this really what I'm paying basically $10 a month for? Spotify has abandoned all reason and clearly stopped paying attention to its customers. The UI is ridiculous - why is the play button all the way to the left? It's a joke. If I hadn't already invested years into building my catalogue in Spotify I would switch in a heartbeat.
After pressing the song that i want to hear. It's playing another random song. Today i am using this app for the first time and my mood is completely ruined because of this app. Please fix this issue. I want to be able to hear the song i like not just any random song.
can't swipe the player controls up/down. and the play button in on the left instead of between back/forward.
For dropping support for Pioneer and Kenwood and changing buttons in layout more than 1 star is too much.
"Completely unreasonable and unjustifiable UI change moving the playback buttons to the left and switching the order, with no option to revert."
"Android app is garbage. Have to force quit to stop it playing, widget doesn't work, player controls aren't there anymore, constantly pauses playback in areas where WiFi is good enough for smooth 4k video playback. Spotify don't seem to be bothered about fixing anything, just taking in the cash and exploiting smaller artists. Cancelling next month."
Glitchy as hell. Didn't used to be like this but often says no internet connection even though I am. I'll play something and it'll start playing but not appear playing in the app or in my notifications. I will download something BUT I CANNOT LISTEN TO IT WITHOUT HAVING INTERNET TO START IT. which makes zero sense as what's the point in the option of downloading!? It'll also automatically skip my song or podcast randomly. Joke of an app that seems hell bent on ruining customer experience
I love this app but for some reason the buttons got jumbled up? I tried reinstalling but nothing happened. I reported it but got no response. What's going on? Other people's app look normal except mine.
"Have tried Amazon since last screw up with Android and memory cards, which is still not fixed and the sound quality is excelent. Seriously question why I continue with Spotify. It's as if every release you try to annoy long term, loyal Premium users. What's with moving the play and rewind and forward buttons. Why change it? Just started using podcasts again, having moved from Acast, which was perfect. No ability to play a single podcast without having the next play automatically. Useless"
"Yesterday I've noticed that the layout of the play, back and forward buttons were changed, I don't understand the point on that, it looks and feels unbalanced, the play button should always be in the center, At first I thought that it was a bug, but apparently is some sort of experiment, well... It would be better if Spotify had a Beta Program for those who want to try experimental features. Please! Don't mess with the interface too much! Symmetry is all we always!"
"For some reason...My music is going fast. I have no idea what to do, or anything. I'm quite frustrated with something causing this. This the second time I had some kind of issue with this app, last time it was something to do the music not playing at all, speeding up without option to slow it down, and playing in the background after the music has been stopped. Anyways if anyone is having the same issue did you ever receive help? at all?"
Actively dislike using since the shuffle button update
"Why do you keep ruinibg the interface? Now right handet users cant use the app properly, dumb move if the majority of population is right handet"
The new order and placement of the playback buttons is so far from any other software that it makes the main player view unusable.
"The problem with spotify is they constantly pressure customers to buy the premium version. Its one thing to advertise the premium version. Its another thing when they slowly ruin their free version so as to pressure the customer to buy the premium. The free version has an overly complicated and difficult to use UI. In addition they keep removing services from the free version. I used to be able to preview a song before adding it, but they, in addition to other services, removed that recently."
Whose idea was it to move the play/pause button from the middle? Worst design change ever!
Fix your UI. This left aligned nonsense is horrid.
This app is garbage. It doesnt let you play the exact music you want to listen to. The rewind button is useless and you can only skip a few times. It's impossible to play songs from the playlist I created and only plays random songs that are not in the playlist.
Tf spotify why i cant listen to my fav music why do i have to buy premium so i can the shuffle? Like bruh i love spotify before but now i hate it so much u guys really want money huh this is why alot of people are quitting spotify and download other free music on free no premium im so disappointed 1 star for this
Why the X close button ain't appear in notifications area. How can i quickly turn off this app from notification area.
Who legitimately thought that having the play/pause button on the left was a good idea? I refuse to believe there are actual humans working at Spotify. Singlehandedly one of the most stupid changes I've had the misfortune of seeing
"Weird UI, Make the play button the same place it was before. It's just awful now."
"This update is making my ocd go nuts by moving the play button. Really not impressed. Why did it move? Also. I hate how it never tells me what was actually in the update. I'd like to know what goes on with a service I pay for. "" Always Making improvements"" my a$$."
Release Radar playlist doesn't have turn on/off shuffle button
"The app doesn't show buttons, including play, nexr, previous, settings, the touch target is there but the button isn't, maybe it's related to my phone model but I like this thing fixed or clarified please!"
"Free music is fine, but only when you want it. On my phone, Spotify suddenly and uninvitedly switches on and plays loud music when I am trying to concentrate on my work, and there is no easy way to kill that blare. It is most inconvenient and also embarrassing, if there are others in the room working quietly."
"Why is spotify working badly at the moment? This is quite new, after years of working perfectly. When will it be fixed?"
"With millions of paying customers Spotify should up their game. The experience is riddled with bugs and bad UX. Updating payment method from app leads to wrong payment tier, and does not work. Changing payment method in browser allows pasting card number only once then oayment does not go through even after confirming from revolut, second time you have to type in number. Had to reinstall the desktop app for favourites to work. Etc. all in all abysmal ux for anything beside basic listening."
They stole my song and the rights . I don't recommend it. Up to you guys if you want to still upload. I've asked to be reimburst for my song and they paid someone else and have yet to get back to me so I will need to sue . Use YouTube and boycott Spotify. If I could go any lower than 1 i would . Evil buissness practices. Almost died in process of getting a single paid out. Neil Young good for you . DON'T TRUST Spotify !!! I got your back Neil . Good riddance eat a peach
"Most recently I turned on the app to find the pause unpause button pushed all the way to the left for reasons unknown, so now I (right-handed) can't pause or unpause music with one hand! If this was a bug, how do I fix it. If this was a conscious choice, why in the holy vegetable patch did you want this? Who does that benefit? Edit: Messaged Spotify support, it's apparently intended for some reason, and impossible to change! So yeah, guess Spotify gains a secondary function as a juggling app."
"it kept playing wheres your head at, one star, except a lawsuit coming your way"
Why would they put the play/pause button to the left of the Previous/Next Song options? The world doesn't make sense anymore. This is absurd.
Redoing the play button skip n rewind leaving them unorganized was dumb af. That alone is gonna make me unsubscribe. Why mess with a good thing smfh
"The last few days a bug has appeared where the song plays with no sound, I need use the skip back button to jump back to the start of the song and then the audio starts - using the time seeker to do this doesn't work, it stays silent until I skip back to the start :("
"UI developers are supposed to make the UI better, not worse. Seems like some dev needed to justify their existence at Spotify and created this stupid new layout so they could look busy at work. Its garbage. Go back to UI kindergarten and revert the complete nonsense changes that were made to music controls (left aligned buttons)"
"I'VE BEEN A PAYING CUSTOMER FOR YEARS, STOP RUINING THE APP WITH UPDATES THAT RUIN THE EXPERIENCE"
"I'm sorry but spotify is starting to really make pointless changes to the app and isn't even giving an alternative choice for the consumer once they change the place of buttons, super annoying"
"Why have you moved the play/pause button off-centre. Muscle memory means I keep skipping songs when I want to pause, bad UX"
"""slow down you get 6 skips per hour"" LITERALLY DOESNT LET ME LISTEN TO MUSIC.WANTS ME TO BUY PREMUIM TO DO IT. I WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS ONE SONG AND THEN IT GOES OPENING SOMETHING ELSE AND WHEN I CLICK ON THE SONG IT LETS ME PREVIEW IT FOR 5 SECONDS YO CASH GRAB AP0 IM RAGING SO HARD AT THIS JUST LET ME LISTEN AND SKIP STUFF. S2"
"Not so great latest update!! The play button at the side doesn't make sense. Also, need to work on landscape mode player window. It's difficult to use when mounted."
"No sound when i cast music to my Android TV (or ask my google assistant to play some song in TV). Its playing the song. But no sound is there. Tested on different wifis, checked TV volume settings, app is updated to latest .. All other muisc apps just work fine (able to cast from my phone to TV. Also i am able to play songs in TV via voice assistant) with amazing sound clarity. Spoity plays something but unfortunately muted. So something definitely wrong with the app i guess."
"I would have rated this as -☆ if that's be possible, Spotify have become the most annoying app just because of the ads, I understand that you can't provide music for free everytime and want us to purchase your premium but dude, this much ads for the free people? Really? Ads are continuously coming back to back, like after every 2-3 songs the ads appear. Fix it dude, stop showing these much advertisements, its just ruin the music experience of people who loves to listen."
"Jesus please change back the play UI who thought it'd be a good idea to move the play button to the left of the screen? It's just messy, ugly, and completely pointless. I already overpay for this service, why would make a change so completely unnecessarily gross to use?"
the new update is the ugliest thing I've ever seen and I'm genuinely thinking about switching to another app cause this update was the worst thing to ever happen to Spotify
"This was the only app I was using to listen songs but now this new update has changed the app features which was the only speciality of Spotify Now every song is in a playlist and you cannot play any song with your choice you only have to first listen the song in the playlist!! The adding of songs to queue feature has also gone! Whenever you click on the next play button it skips to the 6 song, WOW!! And even you cannot forward the song, you have to listen it!! Didn't expected, Felt very bad ☹️"
"hate it, where the hell did the skip button is? And i can't choose what to listen to . It always gives me random songs when I click one, and I hate the shuffle thing, I want to pick what I want from my personal playlist. I tried downloading lite and it was good for a while until the same problem is happening, am moving."
Music will stop at random intervals while getting rid of the stop play and pause buttons. I pay for premium for downloaded music but to listen to anything downloaded i have to put my phone into airplane mode or turn my wifi off.
the button is not working
"Right song won't play, I'll tap the song I want to play and another song starts playing. I absolutely despise it. As well as the fact that all of a sudden I can't loop my songs anymore. The button's just not there."
Who is releasing these updates to the app without testing them? Current version of the app doesn't show 'now playing' and will play over other audio and has no pause button to press.
I never could figure out how to use it. Terrible UI and horrible ads. They clearly don't pay their Podcasters enough because they still have to do ad reads.
"I downloaded the entire playlist of Taylor Swift . But some songs of that playlist are not playing. So I don't think Spotify premium is worth it, atleast for me. I purchased 1 month premium to check whether it suits for me or not. My experience was horrible with it so i probably will never buy Spotify premium. Today is 13 may 2022 and on 15 may 2022 it will expire, then I will uninstall Spotify. Other points to be noted:- 2. can't download individual song. 3. Sometimes the song doesn't pause"
"Stop updating the app and making it worse. I'm writing this review because they updated the currently playing song banner to a ""new"" version. Except this new version is buggy AF on my pixel 2 xl when the old one worked fine. I have to end the app and reopen it to fix it almost every time I'm using the app. Stop making the user experience worse in the name of user experience Update: new phone and now the bugginess is in the lock screen ""now playing"" notif."
"Quality of the app has definitely going downhill. Recently experiencing song skipping when playing through bluetooth earbuds, opening the app to a blank screen and having to restart it, and since getting a new device, the notification ""playing on this phone"" is broken, showing several songs that are *not* playing, that I can't seem to get rid of no matter what, nor will they actually play from the bar and just seem to be completely glitched. EDIT: 13/5/22 Now you've moved the play pause button??"
"WHY HAVE YOU MOVED THE PAUSE TO THE LEFT AND THE SKIP TO THE MIDDLE, this is by far the most nonsensical and absurd update I've ever seen. I can't even begin to fathom the thought process that went into this update; the only somewhat logical explanation is that Spotify is trying to annoy the consumers enough to warrant angry tweets about it in order to gain traction. I won't change to another music service because Spotify has the best UI (apart from this) by a long shot, so please, FIX IT!!!"
"The new player UI is terrible, even I know that's not how to design a UI."
Often crashes. New layout (pause/next and previous track buttons) is awful. Also a weird sound distortion now and then
"Spotify sucks now. They removed the shuffle button for albums, when they should ideally make it an option to still shuffle as I almost exclusively shuffle. I have premium and it doesnt even work now. Like what am i paying £10 a month for?!? It constantly stops when i'm listening to my downloads offline and won't work until i connect to the internet again... Considering cancelling my subscription and switching platforms if these problems arent sorted."
"Ok so the new UI is interesting. Please move the pause/play button back to the center, but otherwise the new UI isn't too bad. Still glitchy tho, I was having trouble putting a song on repeat if it wasn't on a playlist I made."
"When I came here in Dubai, UAE, the rewind button is not working, I can't adjust the streaming line and I can only skip 6 times per hour. I can tolerate all the ads in the world but what is this. Seriously!! In order to get rid of these inconvenience I have to shell out 20 AED PM?? Spotify!! Can u really do something bout this.?? 😫."
Where's the Exit button? Keeps running in background. I have to go into settings to Force it to Stop. Or have to clear memory to get rid of it? Rather than that hassle I'm uninstalling it.
"Every update manages to leave the app worse than the previous one. Now the songs in a queue don't stay in the order I select and it doesn't even show the list of songs in it, so it's impossible to rearrange it. Also, when I select only one song to listen to, it goes in an infinite loop without the repeat feature being on. It's a nightmare of user experience!"
"Constant crashes that require me to restart my phone to undo and the free version is TERRIBLE 6 skips per hour, don't get to play indivdual songs and YOU CANT RESTART A PLAYLIST which means if you've played the whole song and want to go back to it you LITERALLY NEVER CAN because the playlist goes into random song mode and never returns to the playlist aswell, and you cant even restart the playlist so you have to restart entirely and dont think about making a new one cause that doesnt work. Trash"
Horrible... I can't find the buttons... The songs won't show up... Even if I updated it... What happened??!!
"I am sorry to do this but i am dropping my 5 stsr review. this stupid update taking away the green shuffle button was a horrible idea. I enjoyed having that option to randomly shuffle my music, now you have the play music button twice by making the green shuffle button a play button its a stupid design flaw fix thus flaw and I will happily raise it 5 stars again"
"I loved this app, quite easy play and lounding of song, I was paying for the $16.00 a month. Now it want load sing and the play offline not work at all. I have stop stop the premium subscription As I can't use it and now I only able to play in my house. As the freedom of my music list help my Austm not kill or salfe cut, I have headphones I cant ues and see how long I make it without my life support."
"The last few months this app has been really unstable, updates bring issues like the controls bar at the bottom of the screen being missing, continuing to play after disconnecting Bluetooth devices. These issues seem to be fixed after a few days but come back again. Whoever does your Regression testing needs to be sacked! Paying premium money for an amateur seevice. If it doesn't improve I'll be cancelling my family plan"
"A couple days ago the play button on the now playing screen moved to the far left and the previous/next buttons are in the middle. I hope thus is a bug, because if this is an intentional change someone needs to be fired, seriously a chimp could design a better UI. This NEEDS to be fixed"
"1 star for attention, I love the app. But, I have an issue with the ""hide on playlist"" button. Just because I do not want this song on the playlist I'm playing, does NOT always mean I don't like the song. I may still want it on my Favorite list. DONT make it a one-or-the-other only option. Also, why do I need to waste a skip when I do hide a song? Like I said, I may like the song, but don't want it on the list I'm playing."
"I have a premium account, yet I have to re-download songs almost daily. Some times it takes several minutes to even open the app. Also, when I open my playlists, I have to turn shuffle off, pick a song, and then turn shuffle back on. Otherwise it will just stop playing completely after a few minutes. This used to be a great app, but the more I use it, the more I wonder why I'm paying for it. Only reason I haven't canceled my subscription is because it took a long time to build my playlist."
"I have Premium but it's genuinely not working right, for example it I try to click ""add to queue"" it says ""You've discovered a Premium feature! Get premium"" :/ yeah okay"
"Can anyone explain why my play/pause button is now all the way to the left, while my fast forward / rewind buttons are to the right? Why isn't the play/pause in the center anymore, between the fast forward and rewind like it used to be?? Is this a glitch??"
"The recent bugs have been making the app unusable. I close the app music continues to play, the start up time is incredibly slow, the app can at times be completely unresponsive, it won't show what its playing nor the buttons to controll shuffle, and the app just sometimes stops working."
"Worst app ever It used to be the best but now its not :/ The app wont let me Play ehatevrr song i want and all my playlist have a shuffle symbol in the corner of the play button And i cant actually play what i want😡 And wont let me get rid of the song and just stays there, the only way to not hear the song is to 1. Exit the app 2. Turn ur volume down or 3. Pause it :// I'd give a 0 if i could"
"The ad increase is quite unexpected, between every song I get 3-4 ads. I realized I'm starting to get more ad time than vibe time. There's a way around them, for free, but that's my secret. Spotify, do better, the ads are getting out of hand. Starting to look like Pandora!"
"I should NOT have to shut off my data and wifi just for my playlist to load up quicker. It's downloaded and saved to my phone, so why does it take forever to load up when connected to internet and mobile data."
I'll give you more stars when you quit screwing over Tom McDonald!
Move the pause button back to the middle. Reinventing the wheel for no reason.
"The UI is so terrible, I'd rather find my old CD Walkman and listen to music thete."
Spotify app won't load library section if it's not connected to the internet even if you have all your songs downloaded. So what's the point of paying for premium to download music if you can't access it when you need offline access. This is the most stupid part of the app that's frustrating every time I'm in my underground parking or in an elevator. Focus on fixing the music part of the app before constantly changing the UI or adding useless features.
"App keeps going quite every couple of seconds for every song that I play, other apps plays fine except for Spotify"
New interface is non intuitive. Play/pause button should be in the centre
"Wouldn't let me select my fav artists, and skip button didn't work either"
"I've ALWAYS had problems with the app crashing but it was manageable. At this point I don't know why I bother paying for Spotify. The app rarely works when I open it. If something actually does play I can't see the play/pause option or the track info at all. It usually requires I restart my phone to get this ONE app, Spotify, working 100%. Reading reviews I seem to not be alone and many customers are having the same prolonged issues. Yet Spotify does nothing to fix the issue."
Bad ui not working smoothly on fossil 5 . Lacks some important features
"So Spotify it's been a few months now, so do you want to maybe fix the now playing bar from ****ING disappearing every few minutes of opening Spotify!!!!!! When you are paying 17 quid a month it's really not on, also sort out your customer service!!!!!!!!!!"
Constantly pausing or crashing. The quick bar at the bottom is constantly disappearing. Uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. Bordering on unusable after the last update. Not going to keep paying for premium at this point.
"Spotify is my ""way to go"" when it comes to music listening until the new update came. This update was the worst. I can't even play the specific song that I chose. There are times that I want to listen to a song multiple times, but this time... I CAN'T. PLEASE FUX THIS HELLISH UPDATE!!!!!"
Change the playback UI back to what it was
"The whole ""only six skips an hour"" ruins the whole app, it keeps reccomending me shite songs and I can't even change it"
"They play suggested songs that I really hate, and never stop doing it, because I am a free user they don't care, so I will take you out. What a way to ruin a experience, hope you get out of business."
"App is broken. The play button goes missing, then the music shut-downs randomly as you have no control..."
Bruh its so bad like u made ur own playlist the few minutes after some songs some random songs will appear u cant skip. Song are shuffled in playlist theres no loop button and theres no unrandom button
Automatically plays music when the app isn't even running. No option to get this to stop. Had to Uninstall to get it to quit. Garbage app.
"Such a horrible user experience😵‍💫😵‍💫. The app didn't even have the button to close the current music 😑.For last 3 days, M not getting the button to play any song when i tap on it, it just play the highlight of the song😑😵, I cant see the queue as well Unistalling 🤐😵‍💫"
"preview songs has been deprecated, makes it quite difficult to make new playlists and explore new songs."
"Gone downhill. Since update, at least, can no longer connect to devices outside of Bluetooth (TV, Chromecast). The app is so slow. It crashes. It disappears - when something (finally) starts playing, the app doesn't show in your dropdown, the buttons/active song don't show in app, either - so there's no way to control it. Makes this rather pointless. & if they're not bothered by this, no use resorting to using the browser or desktop app, either, still supporting them despite decline/uselessness."
"Once a year in try Spotify out again when they have a deal, and it just seems to get more bloated and slow every time. The UI is annoying and buggy. It constantly lags out and crashes. They make it hard to control your queue. I have NONE of these problems with YouTube Music. Not sure what's going on over at Spotify but it feels like they just keep injecting new features into a broken app instead of fixing the fundamental issues."
"Grabage app, I have to uninstall and reinstall to correct a few regular issues, mostly the play button not working and my playlists not loading"
"As of lately, about 2 months ago, Spotify app on all platforms when used as a streaming controller for my Google home is just beyond broken. Let me name just a COUPLE of the issues I encounter: -Skipping songs when I don't tell it to skip songs and continuing until I disconnect Spotify -Doubling songs on queue and refusing to remove one of the 2 songs doubled, or doubling songs that aren't even on queue -Not playing a song at all even if clicked a million times. Absolutely atrocious."
Horrible UI making it confusing to navigate and non stop ads on the free version.
New update and i cant control my music gonna stop paying for app and go to livexlive spotify sux now
"The app sucks. Constantly dropping. I'm a premium paid member and it constantly stops. Also, the lime button is not working."
Lacks a lot of essential features most services provide (like a simple way to shuffle music especially on albums or a proper dislike button) only reason it's worth grabbing is it tends to work on any car radio.
"EDIT: ....why are you the way that you are? Every update you somehow make the UI worse. Not only did you remove the search/filter and then hide it behind a menu (3 dots), now when you use it in your liked songs, you can't filter by that. Hitting shuffle, after you've searched the artist, shuffles all your music, but only displays what you searched. What the actual hell. I'm blown away at how the app worsens with every update, please fix this garbage. I'm already shopping for other platforms."
"SPOTIFY IS TERRIBLE! Before podcasts, Spotify was fantastic. Today? utter disaster. The user interface (UI) is so bad that I am honestly in awe. If they go back 2-3 years, they will improve the quality of their app by a good margin. Sadly, they also support misinformation, they force content on premium users, and there is not even a way to edit the home page! I resorted to having my playlists as widgets, I simply open the app directly to a playlist, and never see more of the app. And the icing on the cake? remember the days when you could call Spotify and complain? well, those days are gone. They do not have a line to call. They are just terrible, for no good reason. Lastly, as someone with ADHD, who absolutly *needs* simplicity, this app is one of the worst there are (although most apps seem to travel the same way - down the drain)."
A recent change has (once again) ruined the experience for commuters with intermittent connections (like the 8M NYC subway riders). You now need a connection to look at a playlist you already have downloaded...
"Such a simple requirement as being able to play more than a few songs in a row in the background, without having the app pause/freeze playback seems basic, but unfortunately Spotify is not able to do this (even without any restrictions in android and even with downloaded songs). Have to open the app constantly and switch to next song just to be able to resume music playback. Sometimes opening the app and waiting for a while also magically starts the playback again. This is simply unacceptable."
Still randomly turns on for no reason. I don't understand how this hasn't been fixed. The other UI issues that are going on shows how quickly Spotify is going downhill.
"You guys seriously need to fix bugs and implement a keep alive service. For a paid app it's quite poorly built. Edit: it only got worse. Now many times the app won't even open, I pay for this, damn. Can't play local files either"
Hey can you add something like a button or something to press to turn off the good afternoon part on the start screen it's qnoyying I have something I want to remove off there a old playlist and no matter how many playlists I listen to or how long I listen to it it doesn't go away or add another playlist so please just give us a option to remove it or delete a playlist off there it's really annoying
"The previous problem was solved, however now everytime I swap back to the app. It takes me to the top of the playlist, and when you have 400 songs in a playlist that's quite annoying"
App was pretty good. Recent update ruined it. Can't see what song is playing on my phone. My car no longer shows what is playing. App doesn't stop playing when I exit my car like it used to. Going to have to drop this app if not fixed asap. Not going to pay for it when it's like this.
Not even worth it for non-premium people let alone people that dish out cash on this intensely broken app I recommend anything else even scrolling through my built in ringtones is a better option then this app if it was possible 0/10
why remove the toggle button for offline mode as most users rely on the quick function to save data usage? won't be renewing my subscription
"This app is garbage and you should feel bad as developers I can't even listen to the music I like , my own album is full of recommended song from Spotify and they play on random , I can't even delete them ,I can't even listen to the music I want what's the point of using it, are you fuxking stupid ?"
i hate shuffle i can't start my playlist mygosh please remove the shuffle button i don't have a money for the premium!
Every time they update this app it gets progressively worse and less intuitive to use.
"There's always something wrong with this app! It's either stopping, action buttons inactive, can never pull up my music when I search my liked songs. Do better!"
"Outside of the application being terribly programmed (loses connection frequently, slow to search), Spotify barely pays it's artists, far far from a living wage, and continue support anti vaccine garbage, and capitalize and profit off hatred and misinformation. I genuinely wish Spotify would disappear entirely. They serve no purpose whatsoever."
I loved this app......... until the app added songs to your playlist.Like... I made a playlist because that's what I like to listen to. STOP RUINING GOOD APPS FOR ME!!!!!
"Downloaded playlists have trouble loading. App has difficulty streaming to my Amazon speaker, or will change where the output is randomly and without my input. Had this app for over 10 years and it has gone way downhill. Spend less time on my wrapped playlist and more time improving your UI"
Spotify decided to ruin the ap for no reson. They made the ap so when adding songs you can't play previews of the songs or even listen to theym at all untill after you add it to the playlist. I recommend trying other apps before trying this one.
"The app quits by itself and restarts by itself can't even get through one song it crashes to damn much, FIX THE DAMN PROBLEM!!!!!!!"
"I am seriously considering cancelling my premium. Nothing is working correctly, whenever I reboot my phone, all of my downloaded offline songs are deleted, and I am signed out of my account. This issue has been plaguing users for years and it seems nothing has been done about it, this a horrible business practice, and a horrible user experience."
"For podcasts this simply isn't good enough. Buggy, not loading correctly reliably, plays completely on its own with the app closed, no offline use when you can download the podcast. Glitchy play buttons, worst in the market for me. Shame i'm being forced to use it for JRE."
1 Star because reordering a playlist on Android is the most unintuitive thing I've seen in a very long time.
"It used to be a wonderful app and I was about to finish my 1 year usage of this app. Spotify was my favorite, just until they made streaming on other devices PREMIUM. I mean, how can you change a feature's identify of being free or premium after a long time, even after it was free for years! Seriously disappointed with the Spotify company's promise and agreements. Never gonna buy or use this app's features again. I quit Spotify Ltd.!!!"
"I'm quite dissapointed. I want to play my playlist but it only plays songs I haven't added! I have over 15 songs so it shouldnt be playing recommendations. There is no point in this app if I cant even play the songs I want.👎 I cant think of anything positive that makes this app stand out. Disgusting, horrible app. Would never recommend."
Terrible as hell :( I can't even listen to only my playlist anymore. Spotify even adds other songs i don't like and doesn't let me skip or change it to one of my playlist. I can't even listen to the song i search. Theres no on and off shuffle for none premium. This is a really unfair update. I had to delete it because of that. >:( Clearly a lot of people also has this problem and are forced to delete this app now. This app was really nice and had potential but the update just ruins it.
"Not able to search song even when connected to internet. This issue is there for quite sometime now, need fix for this!"
"I'm paying for the premium, but lately, a normal file player would have been better. It breaks music, without hitting any buttons, then I need to force stop and restart, it won't play on my computer and certain podcasts, eventhough it did two days ago. A serious bug fix needed!!!"
What a app always boasts about its premium version and it's kinda of forcing a customer to use their service.. they don't even care about their comfort but only focus on money making....I THINK IT IS USELESS TO DOWNLOAD BCZ THE REASON IS THEIR ADS 2 SONGS AND THEN AD AND AGAIN AD AND THE MOST FUNNY THING IS THAT U CAN'T EVEN SKIP THEM ........they just ruin your mood and vibe.....their premium service is very expensive...I am giving it 1 star Bcz I can't give it 0 stars......a useless app🤬🤬🤬
Crashes when you try and play anything since last update? In general stability has become an issue for Spotify for last few months.... Not great when I have a family membership and they're also having the same issue in iOS as well as me here on Android 12 / Samsung Note 10+ / One UI 4.1 😡
"I don't understand why after selecting choice of songs, I can't click on the DONE button. Even when I try to use the back key to leave the page, it shows SKIP or CHOOSE ARTIST. I still cannot click any of those"
"Since the latest update (Jul 2019) the app has become considerably slower, changes to the UI are entirely unuseful, now have to 'like' tracks as well as save them to access within all music, artists no longer ordered alphabetically but some completely random order. My list of complaints could go on, it was fine before but now it's just a pain to use. Update: the year is 2022, the app now asks me to turn on Bluetooth everytime I open it. I only use wired headphones. Another great addition boys"
"This app is rubbish. After playing a song you searched for it continues to play random songs with no option to go back or repeat. No way to see your own playlists. What is the point of this app? Whoever designed this would be better off getting a job selling hotdogs... The UX rating for this is a big, fat 0."
"0/5 taking 1.73GB storage pauses not buffer after every song until I open the app and hit play, bug? The playpause button works fine on the lockscreen but not the skip button The backwards button doesnt work because you cant go back even one song or even to the beginning of the song you are on unless you pay Upon closing the app it will close the window but stay open in the background swipe down from top to see You can only access shuffle mode NOT able to choose the order of music unless you pay"
"I can't wait to rail about how you try to get people in accidents by fkn up the voice and getting it wrong as MUCH AS POSSIBLE to involve multiple clicks,searches,inquiries,etc...and if I get hurt. Hit you up on the fr fr."
"Really bad for podcasts. Doesn't even show the pause button, let alone 15 seconds forward and 15 seconds back"
"requires the subscription to skip More them 6 songs,play the song you want,and download songs witch is bs"
"Continuously getting worse. Each update to the gui makes it harder and harder to find or organize any of my songs. Crashes and bugs are frequent, sometimes forcing a reinstall just for the app to properly function. Has been this way for years and will probably remain this way due to the developers clearly disregarding the user experience with the idea that they have the monopoly on music streaming apps. Honestly, the only thing this had over Piracy was convinence, and it lost that years ago."
"Bought a head unit designed to work with Spotify Connect, only for Spotify to remove the functionality in favor of making you pay for a device thats not even available. Trying to force people to pay for what they could already do is a scummy tactic, and head units are still advertised as supporting the service. Shame on spotify, I'll be terminating my family plan."
"The ads on the app are massively louder than the music. A terrible way to bully people into upgrading. That itself makes it borderline unusable for me. Sometimes, the app loads without the bar for play/pause buttons, and it's impossible to control anything. It often keeps playing random songs after a playlist is done, instead of stopping. I switched to a competitor, and don't have all these problems anymore."
"This app is horrible. I'm pretty young so I can't afford premium, I understand the ads but I have my own favorite songs I like to listen to, and shuffle play ruins everything. When I listen to a Playlist, I have to listen to around 6 full songs that I don't enjoy until I can listen to a song I do enjoy. I think without premium you should atleast not add random songs into the Playlists, I literally spend most of the time on the app being really pissed off because of these songs I don't listen to"
For a while now there are multiple issues with the app. Music suddenly stops but shows only pause button as if the song is already playing. Some songs just won't start playing unless I press the pause button multiple times. Sometimes app changes the song out of nowhere. In some cases doesn't even show the song playing and the music seemingly comes out of nowhere. Impossible to enjoy music and playlists because of this. Really disappointed because I pay monthly for a premium account.
"In need of improvement, there is way too much content to that is promoted, I can not sort by genres, worse still I can not define the genres I listen to and not show those I don't, even in the paid for version!! Can it play music? Yes, is it worth the money? Absolutely not! When you can not customise your own listening experience to suite your own taste in music then you are kind off missing the point."
My shuffle button doesn't work I've installed and deleted and installed several times and the problem persist. I have tried everything I could find to try on the internet and nothing changed.
keeps taking away updates and reverting to a worse experience half of the time. I was able to slide to queue and the UI was much better but they took both of those away I guess.
"I don't know Abt premium version, but free version is the worst experience. U get few song skips, ads and confusing UI, what it shows doesn't play it. Can't go to previous song. Ahh confusing"
"very stupid UI for the phone version, It will only 'shuffle' the songs and will play random songs in this 'shuffle' first time using the app, had no problems on PC. I guess just take your PC with you to the train to listen to music with this."
"The premium version is quite good except for the few bugs that annoys me sometimes. But without the premium it's total garbage. Without the premium you don't have to give us the popular features. I'm also okey with the ads, and not having the ability to skip nor pause nor reshuffle and everything else. But the least you could have given us was the ability to play the song we click!"
"Songs don't play in order, I can't just individually play a song that's already in a playlist, ads every 2 songs?? I'd rather use the built-in music app."
Everytime I tried to make a personal playlist it would always add it's own songs so when I want some music I may start hearing some song about luigi from super Mario bros
worst app logging out by itself not opening properly the ui feels like it is not properly designed
App is constantly freezing/unable to play and requires multiple restarts just to function.
app not functioning properly for months. Music play/pause button not showing.
"Dear Spotify, I just started using your app and I don't like the fact that I can't control it at all. I understand that I'll have to subscribe, but trust is built over time . I enjoyed the first few days but I was bombarded with too many restrictions too soon. It was a huge turnoff. I hope you use more subtle and subjective methods. It was great while it lasted 😌"
"it was good but add a option to listen to only that one song like ""The Final Countdown"" when you want to play it and only listen to it add a button that only listen to that song on repeat"
Would be 5 stars if they werent so invasive. I shut off background permissions for this app and it will still randomly turn and start playing a random podcast when im in my car using Android Auto. Sometimes right when i turn my car on. I wont even open the app but still sometimes after a youtube video is done playing it will turn on. This is illegal I have background permissions shut off. This calls for a lawsuit.
"I've been using this app for years now and it's been amazing, but ever since the new update it's just been unpleasant to use. There are many glitches and the design of everything is just crammed together and there's too much to look at at once which makes it kind of an eyesore. I want the old, simpler design back."
"A company with the worst team of designers, yet there aren't many other options so you're stuck with their constant garbage changes. LET ME SORT MY LIBRARY HOW I WANT AND LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE."
"Only used it for a few hours before forced to uninstall it. It's like the app can't be stopped if you have a Bluetooth media device connected. Even if U force close the app, songs will start playing if U connect a new headset (eg start Ur car with Bluetooth on) or if U click the call answer/reject button. The only option is to reopen Spotify while the music is playing and stop it again. Spotify will start again if U reconnect your Bluetooth device. Horrible experience. Get some real developers"
Battery consumption is very disappointing. Music app should be well optimised because music is not a thing people play for while and done. Majority and in my case I listen music all day while work in office. With Spotify this is quite hard for me to last phone battery for day. For reference I used tidal and deezer. I never had this issue. New to Spotify and this thing is bad.
"I used spotify and if you try to run a local audio file on your device it will auto open in Spotify. You can ""solve"" this by getting another music player to run it through instead, but if I tell an app don't open my files I want it to not open my files. I uninstalled the app and magically my local audio player works again. This is one of the most frustrating bugs I have run into in quite some time. (You can turn permissions off if you want but Spotify will open the file regardless)."
"The April 13th update ruined Spotify. I can not see whats playing, can not forward rewind pause or stop music. I have to force stop the app the shut it down. And, coincidentally, it has nit worked in my car since the update."
"This new update was the worst o! I can't toggle between songs, it's more like the buttons are unresponsive...imagine a song already playing at the middle, if i press the back button the song should start all over. But no, the song keeps playing, the buttons for back and next are unresponsive!!!!!!!!!!! I have to literally swipe to the next song and back again...this update is the worst!!!!! The app wasn't like this before."
VERY BAD. i have used spotify for so long and now its lagging alot! I search a song thst i like and after i press the play button alot of other songs come up!!!! I have to say my excperince on spotify is a 0 out of 10.
"Rather than convince you to buy Spotify Premium through quality product, they annoy you into it. Thirty seconds of a child babbling incoherently, switching between left only and right only ads, and so on. It's not quirky. It's annoying and is a bottom of the barrel sales technique be which will lose more than make salea."
"Screaming Loud Commercials (so much LOUDER than the music) literally every 4-8 minutes IF YOU DO NOT PAY for premium. Several of the ads offering 3 months of free premium will actually stop the music from continuing until you take a look at the app and dismiss the ad, however if you have ever in the many years Spotify has existed had premium before you cannot take advantage of any of the thousand premium ads they bombard you with EVERY seven minutes WITH SCREAMING AD VOICES!"
"""Your username is designed to identify you, so you can't change it"". It no longer identifies me, though...?! Why would you do this and ruin the experience for many people? I might have to make a new account and delete mine in the future in order to be safe. No reason to pay either if experiences are ruined at random by no username changes. Friend activity also is broken and unable to be turned on."
Unbelievable. So my art work disappeared for ages so I followed guidelines on Spotify community to uninstall and reinstall and art work is back but guess what all of my music needs to be re downloaded Again. Ffs. Not sure I can be bothered just cancel and go elsewhere.
"Recent updates ruined the service. As the numerous other recent reviews I now have constant pauses happening, app locking, and not transitioning well between car and home. Please roll back to prior version and fix!!!"
"Premium user for years. Very frustrated with the new update that takes away play options, and quits playing randomly. For years spotify has been what i tell everyone to use. But this update severely dropped the quality of the app. I see alot of people co plaining and absolutely no response from spotify. Do you even plan on addressing your paying customers? Or is this gonna be like all other major companies that offer an amazing service then once they get big switch what made them big?"
"This app was greater in the old days, but now? It's absolute garbage! I can't get rid of the bottom play button and I can't play my playlist songs separately!! And therr are alot of bugs, MAKE SPOTIFY LESS CONFUSING AND EASIER TO USE!! AND FIX YOUR APP!!!"
"Loved this app until I realized they took away the preview song button when adding to a playlist, cant even click the song and skip to the chorus to check it out, loyal user for 5+ years and now considering going back to apple music."
Ever since the last update my Spotify hasn't been working correctly. It randomly pauses. Sometimes the next/play/pause buttons are gone. It doesn't connect to my pioneer stereo on Spotify anymore. UPDATE YOUR FREAKING APP!
Recently the app quality has plummeted. Been using spotify for a year. But after the recent updates (spotify and android) the app started crashing. It has become a pain in the @$$ to use this app. I am thinking of switching to youtube music. It used to be my favorite app. But now it irritates me a lot. It keeps crashing mid play; keeps pausing; the play/next/ prev buttons disappear and such. I hate it.
I don't know what they've done but the recent updates have ruined functionality. Edit: came back to give it a one star and looks like nothing has changed. Was constantly crashing yesterday while I was driving.
I loved Spotify and have been paying for prem for years! This last update sux! It won't stay connected to my speaker . Constantly skips songs like we are back in 2004 playing CDs in the boombox. Not a happy customer. Get the update fixed ASAP.
So many bugs recently. Pausing music for no reason. No play button. Music just stopping. Not worth paying for to be honest. Really hope they fix this soon
"As someone who idiotically plays songs for months on repeat, it's thought that I can't find my repeat button anymore... Help??"
Can there be any other app that consistently makes the user experience worse with every update? The song you are playing now covers the last item in a playlist folder so it cannot be selected. With so many options - at better quality - I'm getting very close to ditching spotify.
"The latest uodate have ruined thr app. I an no longer shuffle songs in a playlist. The play bar disappears so sometimes i cant turn the music off. It used to be that when i turned my headphones off the music would stop, now it just plays througj my phone speaker.... and without the play bar I cant turn it off. It also changed my battery optimisation settings so the music stops when the phone locks. Its like they did no testing before doing this update."
have had the app since 2016 and have never had the issues I've had with this last update. Player control buttons disappeared. It stopped playing randomly. won't play in background
"Same problem as everyone else. Cutting out, won't switch off, no play bar. Needs to sorted and quickly. Cheaper apps available."
"My ratings for this app keep going down. Same bug that has been plaguing the pay options resurfaced after a ""fix"". When I asked for a refund for my subscription they said no because it has been 14 days. But the app didn't work for the past 14 days. Find another service if you have an android phone ."
"About a year since last I stop using. Giving it a try again, aand nope. Now, the PC side is still good. But if the mobile side have annoying UI/UX and functionality like this, it disincentives me to stick with the service."
"Terrible UX with search and while offline. Says I'm offline all the time, so, I can't use the app for new songs... Update: now songs play but no controls are shown. Really an annoying bug."
"This works just fine, sometimes! then a new feature gets pushed and there is a new bug that makes you suffer would be nice if we could opt in to beta test instead of getting force feed new experimental ui changes Still got the same bug that makes part of the ui invisible and renders the app useless"
These devs write code for a living but can't figure out a play/pause button. That's embarrassing
EDIT: the newest update made everything even worse. I already said below how it was acting up.. Now it does that and keeps stopping to play every 5 minutes... Fix it please!! Since the new update it keeps turning off and doesn't react anymore to pressing the pause button unless being fully closed.. This is quite annoying bc it's like every 10 minutes
Latest update brought breaking changes on Samsung Galaxy: - Playback stops randomly for 2-3 seconds before continuing - Controls doesn't show up after playing a track How does Spotify release an update like this without any QA?
"I love music so I love spotify. But since I did the update the app is horrible. I cant play music as I want, all my downloaded songs are gone and the button which shows what song is playing is also not available... if this will not be fixed as soon as possible spotify has one customer less."
"Mini player is not visible sometimes, need to restart Spotify to see the mini player? I think it's a bug and Spotify should play significant attention to this ! This is really hampering user experience."
So many glitches now. Have to close app to get it to stop playing as there is no ui to pause or play. Going w YouTube music instead
Waiting for the update to fix everything you guys broke with the last update. No longer can I see favorite songs in Playlists. The song cuts out every 10-15 seconds. Last update ruined everything. Fix it or I'll stop paying.
"songs keep playing when app is closed, and playback ui glitches out, music stops for no reason Edit: already reinstalled boo, its a you problem Update: Having the exact same issue again"
"WAAAAY to many issues for the last couple weeks. Spotify won't show up in the drop down, so i have to go into the app to change the music, rewind, pause etc ... Even worse, I have to force close the app frequently bc it won't display the play button at the bottom.. just a mess."
Constantly crashes the UI but keeps playing. Must be force closed.
"Playing issues are back. | Please add a + button to add to playlist at the bottom of the main player. It takes multiple presses right now to add something to a playlist and that makes Spotify very inconvenient to use, especially while multitasking"
"Spotify. What is going on over there. Has this release been tested AT ALL ? The whole playing bar has dissapeared completely, so the only way to stop playing is to quit the app completely! Despite having offline play lists practically unusable when there is no Internet connection. Continually messing with UI which is now among the most unintuative you have released to date (your UX team obviously does not use the app!) I'm on the verge of moving to another streaming service!"
"I wish this app had HD artist images in the background of an album art as a song plays. The way Microsoft groove music app had. Other than that, thanks for being a great all. Edit for 2022: Why have I dropped number of stars? My app continually crashes. The play, skip, pause buttons disappear randomly, and I have to force my phone to shut down. If this keeps happening, I am considering changing platforms because it is frustrating especially when I head to work."
"The update ruined it. Now music plays without showing up, so you can't hit pause, and the only way to get it to show is to restart the whole app"
Please fix the problem ASAP. I have noticed not only me but others too faced the same problem. The problem is my notification bar that showing what song that play dissappear and I can't control what song to play next and pause the song. Not only on the notification bar but also happened on the app itself. I have been using this app for long time and I gladly if this problem can be solved quickly.
"The player control bar keeps disappearing, requiring a force quit and a restart (or more frequently 2 or 3 restarts) of the app to gain control of what you're listening to again... Makes the app nearly unusable. Probably going to get YouTube music instead. Stitcher for podcasts again :/ it's a shame."
"Limited function on Samsung phones. For over a week the play and other control buttons are not visible inside the app. There is no way to control the music or change the songs, and the app intermittently stops or pauses the music. A company of this scale with an app costing this much needs to do better. No music for over a week"
"Despite having spotify premium my home page always has a banner ad for some podcast episode with some celebrity in it yhat I could not care less about at least when there was a ""not interested"" button that didn't work it gave me the illusion of control but now there isn't even that. Thanks for having baked in ads. Also thanks for being to sure to not have any ability at all to say ""I know I don't like this so stop showing it to me"", epsecially in the context of podcasts."
"Lately I've noticed the app has about a 40% chance of not working when I first open it, I have to close and re-open several times to be able to play anything. As well as sometimes the play/pause button disappears mid-song so I can't change the song or pause, usually have to close and re-open to fix. Also sometimes my liked songs on my account doesn't sync across all my devices, I have to log out and log back in to get it to sync."
Songs stop playing abruptly. No way to continue other than restarting the app. Then you have to manually select the song. This occurs quite frequently now.
"Since update, song playing doesn't show on drop down menu, and pressing play doesn't change the icon to a pause button. Can't close the app either from drop down"
"Terrible UX in this app. And to top that off most of the time searching a song and hitting play triggers an ad, and once you sit through that BS, it just plays an entirely different song. You had one job."
"UI for stopping, next and previous, and play button disappears during music playing."
You broke it with the last update. GUI disappearing without reason. Rollback and try again
Everything was working fine yesterday but today when you go on a playlist and you go to add songs and there's always a play button but today no play button please fix this ASAP
"Great service, but recent update just ruined the app!! Please fix this so we can all have the service back."
Still bugging since the last update. Now playing button still dissapears and the song keeps playing unless one force stops the app...the last update of April 13th didn't fix the issue either.
When i minimize my spotify and go to a different app while listening and go back. The play button disappears and the music starts playing and stopping!!🤬
I find the apps now don't have the play button . It plays for 2-3 songs then stopped . Kinda frustating . Can't even stop or skip the song as there is no button for that .
Randomly stops playing Randomly starts playing Won't display what is playing or the start/pause button Often won't load even what's in my library Plz fix
"Getting worse with every update. It used to be simple and functional, now the app takes forever to load, the UX isn't very good and bugs appear at random and stay for at least the next three versions. The bad quality control combined with the extremely small amount of money artists make with streaming is an absolute joke."
"Cancelling my subscription. I've been experiencing too many issues and been quite about it for too long. I have no idea what is going on now. Music just randomly stops and starts. Oh and the absolute worst! The Now Playing interface doesn't pull up when I start playing a song, so I can't skip replay or pause a track!"
After several update the app isn't working from connected in my car to the latest one on not continuing playing songs from one play list to another. SPOTIFY if it ain't broken don't fix it.
"Lots of bugs. The play/pause button keeps disappearing and you have to restart the app to get it back. Please fix this asap, it is very annoying. Does not connect to my Google home well, glitchy and sometimes skips songs and replays them again."
"Using premium and it frequently stops playing completely mid song, needing me to select the playlist again. Many songs are incomplete and either cut short mid verse or just don't have audio data, but keep 'playing'. Suggestions are appalling, multi device interaction is clumsy, cannot dislike songs. Better of creating a playlist and using inbuilt audio players."
"It is glitchy sometimes plays without the player window but the reason why it gets 1 star (the app itself) is because when I get out of the car it waits until my hands are full and full sun on the cell phone until it inexplicably starts playing again. It happens every time and I am sick of it. The blackness of my phone in the sunlight while I'm wearing sunglasses and I have to maneuver the things in my hand around to lift my sunglasses to squint at my lock screen, open that then close Spotify."
"What happened to my buttons?? Can't even change the songs in my car anymore. I'm paying for premium, fix this!!"
Works but then doesn't. The play pause button disappears and I have to restart my phone just to get it to stop
"App WON'T STOP ASKING FOR BLUETOOTH PERMISSIONS. I have no choice to say no, I can ONLY choose ""MAYBE LATER"". No, I will not ever be granting you Bluetooth permissions, and if for some reason that changes I know where the settings menu is. I powerfully dislike needing to push an extra button to access my music. I'm about to cancel my subscription and find a new music provider. SPOTIFY: ARE YOU GOING TO FIX THIS? >YES >MAYBE LATER"
"Unable to update payment. Use it for years. Previously working fine and right now they only restricted to telco based only on the recent . Because previously, i only subscribe via visa card. Which to me is isn't user friendly. Im switching to Joox. If Joox doesn't work out, i will go back to old method by uploading to the phone. People decided to use you because of the range and can play with sharing method. But if you block like this, it would be a bad for your business and user experience."
"This app has been glitching to the point that it's often unusable in my car. Also the play button vanishes periodically. Also the widget randomly stops working periodically. Will adjust review when these bugs are fixed. If it continues I'll be switching to another platform, as I am a premium user."
another horrible update! the functionality has greatly declined. the playback bar disappears constantly. bluetooth is glitchy and randomly stops playing now. playlist and albums default to shuffle and remain on shuffle even after deselection. all these errors requires closing the app and reopening multiple times during use. im so frustrated that i pay for this service and there is no direct way to report glitches or provide feedback. please revert back to previous version!
"Invasive and relentlessly buggy. I have Spotify Connect turned off, allegedly, yet I'm constantly bombarded with notifications to manage other public devices. Irritating. Also, Spotify is currently randomly quitting after 10 minutes of playing. High quality stuff."
"Playback controls disappear on android can't pause a song. Have to turn off app to pause a song, yes really. Really basic thing that ruins the experience and frustrating enough to cancel premium membership if this is the service we get. This error has been submitted numerous times in last weeks and still has not been fixed. Don't install or get a membership until this is fixed or you will regret it."
Truly a lesson in how to make a UI as unintuitive as humanly possible. Figuring out if it's going to play the queue correctly or just pick it's own music is anyone's guess. Constantly stutters on wifi for no reason. Even with downloaded music.
"App on Android had been getting slower and slower. Takes ages to do anything, no other apps have this issue. Currently horrible user experience. No issue on other OSes."
"Now Playing menu keeps on disappearing! Very poor UX using the app, navigation is just unintuitive. Songs keep pausing for no reason at all. Can't even organize playlists on mobile app (folders). And it will eat up your data because forces you to download offline music every month. Very good music library selecion and shuffle algorithm. Playlist enhancement feature is cool."
It doesn't play the next song in the list and instead plays something random I tried fixing my settings to the best of my ability but failed to fix the problem. There also isn't a reset settings options and it if there is it's hard to find. I don't find the app user friendly for those less experienced with these type of things I'll have to look up a guide or tutorial or SMTH on the internet when I have more time.
"there's no play , stop, or next button. the songs randomly stopped"
"Since the latest update, the user experience is far away from being optimal. Music or podcasts stop all of a sudden. I cannot find the stop/play button because it disappears from time to time and I have no idea why. I am a paying customer and unfortunately thinking about canceling my subscription if there is no improvement anytime soon. I am running the app version 8.7 22.1125 on my Android 12 phone. I deinstalled and reinstalled the app, and I restarted my phone several times, but no change."
App always crashes. Audio and video will unsync. Sometimes no video and just audio plays. Playback buttons will do nothing. Numerous other bugs.
Very boring UI. Need to make it colorful and responsive. Creating playlist is troublesome and can't be found once created. I always need to get to Desktop Spotify to check my playlist.
"It's amazing how you can make a next song button not working after couple of quick song switches, even though the one in the notifications works fine. Only top 5 songs of the artist isn't fine too"
Used to be a great app. Most recent update has made it terrible. It stops frequently and abruptly for no reason (even with downloaded files) and you can't tell what's playing. Please fix it ASAP or I'll be cancelling my premuim subscription.
"When 5* reviews are negative, it's clear that updates are bringing new bugs and ruining a previously-seamless UX - something inexcusable for an app of Spotify's size. Issues I have include: massive issues loading playlists and/or search results (unrelated to internet connection); queuing a song once actually queues it 5+ times; Now Playing bar doesn't always appear upon app launch. Extremely disappointing service."
"Stops playing music randomly, and sometimes the widget at the bottom showing the song name and pause/rewind buttons disappears so I can't pause the song that's playing. Fix the bugs please!"
"It's ok,, but now it doesn't have a widget for the lock screen, so I can't change songs without unlocking my phone, going into Spotify, and then hitting the button. Also my offline downloads constantly delete themselves out of nowhere, then I'm stuck with no music."
"After 4 years of being a premium member I can say this is probably the worst music app on the market. Trying to use this offline is such a pain, since offline play is a premium only feature i would expect it to work but it just doesnt 50% of the time. Downloaded podcasts take YEARS to load unless you're specifically in offline mode, download buttons load indefinitely, spotify crashes while playing in the background often, etc etc. Wish I could find an alternative..."
"Have used spotify for a long time, however, now it won't quit randomly stopping songs. And, I keep losing the controls, which make the app unstable."
"Shame of software development. It's not even fixable, because it is clearly built wrong from the start. It even tries to load the UI using INTERNET CONNECTION and if your connection is slow you have to switch to offline otherwise it will fail to load even the DOWNLOADED songs. Even the order by alphabetical function is broken. Hire new developers and start over. I wish there was a 'show every song from artist' function, but I guess it's impossible. Updates never fix or add anything. UNRESPONSIVE"
"I can't reset my taste profile. I already wrote about this on forum just like other people, but they are don't care. So, if you want nice recommendations for quite a long time, this app isn't for you, because on star recommendations are pretty good. By the way, this is second time I write this comment (it is looks like they delete my first one). And also now there is even at least one bug I found, unfortunately I don't have enough characters to describe it :/ P.S. sry for my English"
"High data usage, a lot of push for podcasts instead of music. And finally bad redesign on user interface. Go back to simple and focus on music please."
"Scam. I got premium and the app does not even work at all. How do you even manage to mess up this bad, so many things in this app don't work, even the play/pause button... DO NOT BUY I have seen small children make better apps than this."
April 16 2022. App is garbage. So many issues lately. No button to skip or pause. Have to end the program to stop music. For a multi billion dollar company you would think you could get the app right
Build is completely unstable. Player is broken beyond belief will randomly start playing music completely by itself.
"It sounds like many other users are also having this issue - the app doesn't show what song is currently playing, there is no way to pause or restart the song, it randomly stops playing. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, logged in and out, cleared my cache, don't everything that I can. Have been a paying Premium member for at least 5 years now and this is the worst user experience I have ever had with this app. Recent update did not fix the problem. Please help"
"Not good if it needs to be updated constantly. The app crashes and glitches continuously. One update seems to create new bugs. Too much focus on the veneer but not on the basics. On the last update the music played but no player. Lock screen notifications would be there one update, gone the next so I doubt the reliability of it. I also have to quit it every time as it runs in the background when not playing sucking battery. I am a premium member, however it doesn't feel like a quality service."
"Constant bugs since update. Player bar at bottom, status bar player, and Bluetooth song info is constantly disappearing. Once I force quit, and reopen everything works. Have to restart at least twice a day."
"What's up with the latest update keeps crashing have to close the app, play bar disappears, albums play from the start instead of continuing from last played in car etc have to force close it, previous update worked fine!!"
"Everytime Spotify updates their UI, I want to shoot myself."
FIX THE GODDAMN APP! Player is totally broken after the latest update (around 1st week of April). - Player controls disappear totally after playing a song while browsing the app - leaving me with no way to control the music in-app. - Ways to control music outside the app have also totally disappeared - I have to get back into the app and close the app from my processes just to make a song stop. You guys totally broke the app in favour of a bunch of minor (and stupid) UI changes.
Unusable since the update. Crashes constantly and no working pause button
"Bloody hell! First I can't get rid of the bar that shows me what is playing, even when nothing is playing. Now I can't turn off Spotify unless I restart my phone! What the hell are you people doing? I thought this would be rectified pretty quickly. I thought wrong! If things work leave them alone!! I have been enjoying the app for a couple of years without a problem until this happened. Can you fix it? Do you have the decency to reply? Is there anybody there? Customer service stinks💩"
"Songs has been stopping by itself, doesn't show what's playing and can't be controlled by the car steering buttons anymore."
"A music app that really struggles to play music. It's never been a great app but recently it has become utter garbage, bugging out and requiring multiple restarts a day, refusing to show downloaded songs when off-line, and a new bug where songs randomly pause for a few seconds then continue, even downloaded ones. Has become such a pain that unless the next update fixes it I will be cancelling my premium account."
"The last update ruined my Spotify. The song just randomly pauses for 2 seconds and starts to play again. Also, whenever I try to play a song it plays a different song from the one that I chose."
"When i use my smartwatch to control spotify, the app either becomes very jumpy (playing is jumpy,or stop playing altogether) or the simply quitted from my phone. Even when music continues to play, the app interface does not display properly on my phone at (even within the app, it doesnt display the currently-playing status). It has been going on for a while and no fixing so far. Now I simply wont use spotify on my smartwatch! Please fix it or I am forced to switch music provider. Thanks."
There are too many minor bugs and inconvenient glitches to write down in one place. It's a terrible user experience especially anything related to Bluetooth devices.
"Soo many bugs littered throughout the new update. The app is extremely unstable now. The horizontal bar at the bottom of the screen disappears after a few minutes, but the songs are still playing, so there's no way for me to open the current song and pause it except closing the app. When i press the pause button on my earphones, it stops for 1 second and starts playing again, songs keep playing when i start watching a video, the notification bar doesn't update with the songs and isn't working."
"UPDATE: Music doesn't play when phone's blocked. Near unusable! Since the last update the currently playing bar at the bottom keeps disappearing. Same for the widget it doesn't work and you can't control the music anymore unless you quit and start it again. Very bothersome, not what I pay for"
Does not work right. Does not give playback controls most of the time and requires me to restart my phone. Yes everything is up to date. Horrible experience can't believe I'm paying for this
After the update Spotify stops playing after 5 minutes and you can't even access the pause/skip buttons. Not worth paying premium for a product that doesn't work.
Was a great app. Now it's broken. You can't see play or pause buttons anymore... Which is kinda crazy for a music playing app. I will cancel if this isn't sorted asap.
"Have always had Premium-loved Spotify and sung it's praises until last few weeks.Keeps stopping mid song -just cuts out. There is no onscreen bar showing song playing-cant stop , start or pause songs.Have to turn phone off to turn Spotify off. I read here many customers saying same thing. Why isn't if sorted? I pay 15 quid a month - come on Spotify-read your customers reviews and fix bugs , otherwise we are off elsewhere !"
"Used to be a good app, but new update has ruined it. I've paid a Spotify subscription every month for about 5 years. My experience with this app over the last few days is likely going to make me cancel my subscription. Music stops playing every 20 seconds or so, the bar at the bottom to play/pause using has been taken out. App is totally unusable now."
"Too much ads. First of all the price is quite high as for premium subscription as compared to the other online music application. Also, 3 4 ads are being Played after every 2 3 songs. This is annoying. I don't mind buying a premium plan but they should reduce their yearly subscription plan."
Butthole designed interface. Even if you pay for premium you get pop upside constantly in the app about albums and artists you nor anyone cares about. I have premium for NO pop ups by the way.
"Going down hill. Vers 8.7.20.1261 lost controls until force stopped the app or restarted phone 8.7.22.1125 then plays one connected session before failing again. Udated to latest, worse. Does all the above plus now stops & starts randomly in the track & then finally stops. It was bad enough when it stopped working with my Garmin Zumo but now it doesn't work with my Samsung A51 5G. I have a family account with spotify. I expect a refund for this month and if this doesn't sort quickly, acct closed"
The connect Bluetooth notification every time I open the app is mad annoying. And they changed the library to include random radio playlists I listened to like 1 time instead of my actual music. App used to be good but all these bad unnecessary updates ruin it.
"It used to work perfectly. I really enjoy the Spotify app however the app keeps on crashing, the music will just stop for no reason etc and it keeps on happening eventhough I tried quitting the app."
There's no control buttons when a song plays...please fix it
"Please fix bugs for Samsung Galaxy, this is an actual joke - now playing button disappears, and Bluetooth connection continually cuts off. App is currently unusable."
"The app has become very unstable. Songs randomly stop playing, and for some reason, possibly a recent update, the player no longer shows the play, pause or skip buttons. Spotify, I want to speak to your manager!!"
"ugh stop pushing the joe rogan podcast into my face every time i open this app. i get that you spent a lot on it, but either recommend something i might actually like or simply dont recommend a podcast at the top of the home screen when i 98% just listen to music anyway. also, the recent redesign of the library seems to me as a fail"
I like Spotify in general and the music library BUT I've had dreadful user experience more often than I should. I use a premium account by the way. The pause and play button are always missing and I always have to restart my phone to stop playing the music. The music also stops itself. This needs to be fixed before I start looking for other options.
"Was 5 star but recently the quality of its functionality is terrible..... the app is not working properly. Play,pause, forward buttons not showing when playing from ""liked songs"" and controls don't appear when screen is locked. Music still playing when app is closed ... what is going on?"
"I am paying for a useless player. Spotify developers did something wrong and now the app does not show the player controls if you come out of the app and go back in again. Used to work fine! I have to end up looking the app and restart so it can show the player buttons again. This also affects the display info the is sent to the car where no info about music being played is sent! Can you fix it asap, I want to pay for a good service!"
New update is terrible! Music bar isnt showing on the bottom.. music keeps playing when i open music on otther apps. The pause/play and forward button does not show on the top of my drop down bar of my phone.. this should not happen on a paying app
"The app keeps doing weird things like the play button and skip buttons disappear and the app sometimes ask me to log in, but I'm already logged in. Since the last update things got really bad in this app making the user experience difficult!"
"I am sorry for being rude, but this app is understandable I want to play a song but instead of playing the song I like it played another stupid song, why? Is it like that?. This app made me rage quit, I give it a 1 star in return.😬"
"I used to love Spotify. Since recent update, I am deleting and re downloading the app. I have premium and there's no buttons to skip songs?!?!?!."
"Was awesome for years until this last update. Can't use now playing, or the next button in my car. It randomly boots up and starts playing or shuts down. Will gladly update review when issues are fixed."
New update has ruined the app. I'm having frequent issues with the Now Playing bar disappearing at random so I'm unable to to pause or skip without closing out of the app and restarting it until it inevitably disappears again.
"This is the worst podcast app I have ever used. The only reason I need to use it is to listen to Armchair Expert, which is sadly an exclusive show. The playback stops abruptly, downloads get deleted in the middle of playing an episode, you need active internet to even access downloads, making the user experience utterly horrible. Not that I expect any better from a morally bankrupt corporation. Sigh."
App is practically unusable after ANY update. Also now you get ads with premium anyway. I would respectfully like to let Spotify know they should just just shove this app where the light doesn't touch instead of actively making their user experience worse.
"Terrible update! For some reason the pause/stop button is gone, music keeps stopping every few minutes, really irritating. Why the hell would you break something what worked well before?! Wish I haven't had automatic updates on!"
Song bar at the bottom of the app is suddenly constantly disappearing. Liked songs have new loading icons too much. Liked songs don't load despite having already downloaded them if I have bad signal. They load faster if I manually turn off the internet completely. Shuffle isn't smart enough to stop playing the same songs in quick succession.
Too many changes too frequently changes the dynamic of the app and how to use it have to update constantly buttons keep disappearing can't control it from your phone correctly!
"Some horrible things are going on in this past update, will reconsider service if these bugs continue. Way too many stops, UI issues, slow loading, and playback issues for a paid service even while using downloaded music."
"very buggy and glitchy nowadays.. the mini player is not there, the pause/play buttons don't work, and Bluetooth cuts out"
This update is the worst of them all. I no longer have the play and skips button or the ability to change where it is playing.
Most recent update has ruined the app. As others have noted: play/pause disapeers and it cuts in and out on Bluetooth headphones. They need to fix this asap or I will be moving elsewhere.
Update has ruined the app. Crashes constantly
Heart button functionality still broken and lately music that is Now Playing will disappear from the bottom of the screen if you exit the app and you have to force close for it to re-appear. Happens every few minutes. I always have to click the options button for a song or album to add/remove it to/from my library with the heart button not actively turning green either since it's broken. Samsung Galaxy S10 running Android 10.
The updates have completely screwed UX. The songs don't show as playing nor do the songs being played how on screen when I'm not in app. Become total garbage
Terrible. Literally have to quit the app 20 times a day as it bugs out. Sort it out Spotify otherwise I will be cancelling.
"I don't often leave reviews, but the Spotify app is poorly constructed. Playlists that fail to load, screens that lock up requiring the app to be force closed, indications of ""no internet connection"" when one definitely exists, downloaded songs suddenly not being downloaded anymore, and so on. Update: just updated the app, and now I can't listen to my music offline (I'm a paying customer, by the way). So I guess expect a pretty rocky experience with the app."
"Downloaded this for podcasts - what a disappointing, frustrating experience. Far worse than any podcasting app i've used. Update - April 2022 - they seem to have done away with the ability to pause, skip forward, skip back etc. So i can start playing a given podcast, and i can select a different podcast, but that is about it. If i want to ""pause"" an episode, i have to quit the app entirely. This is incomprehensible. If Rogan ever leaves, i will delete this app, with gratitude."
I've used Spotify since 2008 and have always loved it. But lately I don't know what's happening with the option to skip/pause a song. I don't even seem to have buttons for this and if I want music to stop playing I have to force the app to stop. If I want to skip a song I have to search for a different one? I've always paid for premium but unless this is fixed I'll look elsewhere. I use it everyday so it's super important it works well.
Quit screwing with Bluetooth! You're going to cause someone to wreck trying to play a damn song!
"Very often the UI is not showing a song or podcast is playing, meaning it cannot be paused or skipped. Only way to get it back for a while is to force stop the app."
App is full of bugs recently. Constantly can't see the play and pause button. Songs just stop playing for no reason. If it doesn't get act together I'm cancelling me due subscription. At the moment it's not worth the money.
"Up until this week, Spotify has been amazing, but as of I think Tuesday the phone app seems broken. It won't show play bar, it won't pause music when I click on the play/pause button by the song in the playlist & it randomly will just stop playing music/podcasts without warning. Sometimes if I do a full restart of my phone the app comes good again, but I can't do that when I'm driving I'm really hoping a fix will come along soon, b'cos I can't afford to pay premium for an app that isn't working"
"Always loved Spotify, had premium trial for 3 months, 2 days ago went to paid premium and now having trouble with it keeping stopping all of the time. Unless fixed (online advice hasn't helped) will be unsubscribing. Quite disappointed."
Have been using this app as a subscriber for years without any problems that I recollect. Since the most recent update I have had two problems that have made it almost unusable. 1. It simply stops streaming after about 30 minutes. 2. The pause button has vanished. Please fix before my next renewal.
Play button/bar/lockscreen gadget disappears while music is playing. Songs stop suddenly and after 2 seconds continues. I'm a premium member. This is occurring since last update.
The latest update has ruined this app. We have a premium account and are very tempted to cancel. It cuts out every couple of minutes and disconnects. The play bar has disappeared! Please fix these issues! If it doesn't get fixed then we will have to go elsewhere.
Latest update broke the app. Music stops playing all the time. The play button controls dissapear. I see other reviews saying the same thing. I'm on Android S10+ and Spotify premium. If you fix it I'll update the review. Been a long time Spotify fan and this is the first time I have serious issues.
"Newest update has ruined the app for me. The player at the bottom disappears from time to time, meaning no skipping, pausing or playing. I have to restart to get it back. Also, whenever this happens, if my phone screen isn't on, the music stops out of nowhere. Not sure what the issue is but I can see that I'm not the only one."
"Last update have serious bug, confirmed happened not just to my device but my friends as well. Song play half way will stop by itself. Control bar will be ""disappear"" on the app regardless how you switch to library, search or other pages. By ""Close by force"", and reopen Spotify app, it will working again. Very annoying. Please fix. Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. Android 12 (One UI 4.1). Confirmed Spotify app update to latest version."
Absolutely broken. Now playing songs don't show up in the app but the music plays anyway. Skip controls via sync do not work. Switching from music to video with audio doesn't stop the track. Garmin controls broken. Can't take calls via Bluetooth as the music won't stop. Fix I cancel my subscription. Oh its also obvious Spotify are paying for favorable reviews due to the influx of real negative ones. Just look at the surge in Indian 5* reviews in the last days.
"Recent bug makes the app unusable. The now playing bar disappears so you can't skip, pause or play songs without force quitting the app."
"As for April 2022, the app is failing a lot, not presenting the control buttons and misplaying on my car android car constantly. My device is a Galaxy Fold 3. I've been using this app for years now and never failed so much like this..."
"Was absolutely brilliant but the last few weeks have been infruiating. Track's will skip part way through & there's often no control panel. So I'm unable to pause the tune, turn the music off, skip or no what's playing. Now it's just started messing with the volume so it's on maximum setting. Please fix this. Spotify has been a lifeline."
I used to love this app but NOT ANYMORE! IT crashes atleast once per song and it shuffled all my Playlists so my songs are no longer in the order that I put them in! Also it doesn't show the song that's currently playing or the fast forward button. So I'll be CANCELING MY damn subscription and deleting Spotify. Why did yall change EVERYTHING?! Everything was A-Ok before but now yall got it way screwed up! I'm PISSED OFF beyond retarded! 😤
Too many ads why are there ads I look every and every and every and just ads the ads are about how annoying the ads are if you know your annoying stop being annoying just ads I forget what this app does all I know is it just has ads mobile games should take notes of these ads cause so many why so many your tearing my apart it's horrible it's loud the ads they yell at me please be quite this is a libary they say they be gone for 30 mins they came back in 6 mins do ads know time please don't ads
I lost my music control button on recent updates. 😪
UI is broken after update. App will continue play through phone's speakers after Bluetooth device has been disconnected. Does not display player button nor allows access them while music is playing.
Recent update took away the navigation buttons I can't pause or skip back or forth. I have to clear my apps is the only way to turn off music. I will cancel subscription if not fixed soon
"Doesn't even work. I pay for this and it keep saying ""playback failed"" when trying to listen to a podcast. Where is the pause button? I can never find it."
"Media buttons disappear after a while, so you lose control of the app. Please fix this bug as soon as possible, as it leaves the app unusable."
"terrible without premium. I cancelled premium a week ago and ever since I can only play songs by tapping on them- I can only stop the music by closing the app. they took away my pause/play button, skip abilities, changing from shuffling/playing through an album or playlist. they stole my money by having me pay for my last month of premium without giving me my premium and even basic Spotify abilities. absolutely ridiculous. also randomly stops playing music even when the app is still open/runnin"
The player keeps shutting down. So the music keeps on playing but I now lose my controls. Even the controls on my Bluetooth headset won't work. Have to keep hard-restarting the app which is annoying. On some occasions the player stops altogether and stops playing the music. Please fix! It was fine before the latest major UI update.
Ever since the last update 4-5-22. The app with pause randomly even on downloaded songs. Also the pause and play button is always stuck on play with music already playing
"Bugging like mad lately. Especiay of connected to Bluetooth, you can't skip or pause songs, and it will randomly just stop playing or disconnect for no reason, on multiple different bluetooth devices. I pay £9.99 a month for what is quickly becoming a useless and frustrating app. Going to cancel subscription if issues aren't identified and sorted asap."
The play bar keeps disappearing so I can't interact with what's playing or any of the buttons. Also broken in the notification bar controller. This is on Android with a pixel 6
"So glitchy and annoying to use lately. Music button bar at the bottom keeps disappearing. Notifications don't work properly, music keeps stopping. Usually great before this"
"Poor UX, unreliable, slow, listening to a podcast with 1000+ episodes? You've got to scroll like an idiot.... Now it constantly has bugs that forces restart just to work."
"Worked great up until a month or so ago when songs or podcasts started randomly stopping. Also my pause/play buttons don't always show and I have to force quit the app to get it to respond properly. Makes the app nearly impossible to use, and I am a heavy user. I've deleted & re-download the app to and fix it, which did the trick for half a day. Will change my rating to 5/5 when this is fixed."
"I love spotify, and premium is 100% worth it for me. But recently, the update has removed the play bar and will play songs even when closed. I really hope this issue is fixed quickly, as I listen to spotify at least 5 hours a day."
"crashes and pauses all the time. function buttons disappear in the middle of playing so I cannot play/pause, stop, track, etc. I update, uninstall, logout of all devices, follow all advice I find on different forums and still..."
"Play button constantly disappears, music doesn't stop when disconnected from Bluetooth, music pauses randomly"
"I use this app every day, numerous times per day. This current version doesn't turn off when disconnecting from bluetooth, doesnt display a play/stop button, and randomly stops playing songs. Very broken compared to last update!"
"This music player sux, if i search a specific music, i cant play it, theres a play button but it plays other music."
The play and pause button keeps disappearing and also my car Bluetooth won't display when playing Spotify which has never happened before
What happened to the UI? Now it's impossible to check what is playing? Is this some kind of minimalistic design? Is this a late April fool joke? Give the basic player functionality back! At least let me stop playing the current song without needing to kill the app XD
"As many others have reported, since a few days ago a) the Now Playing bar started disappearing after a few minutes, which requires a restart to fix for another few minutes, b) music keeps pausing and resuming a second or so later which is extremely distracting when working, c) Bluetooth controls stop working. Adding this comment to all similar comments to really get Spotify to notice this and take action."
"new update has ruined this app. songs turn off everytime the app is not on my main screen now. randomly stops playing, doesn't stop when unplug headphones, please fix this.... it has ruined some of my classes that I teach to music when it stops playing"
I can't pause the music because now I can't even see the pause or skip buttons. You should work on that.
"Seek, play,pause,etc. buttons completely missing from the latest update. Very poor update. Please bring back the old interface."
New ui is just getting worse. I can no longer pause or stop playback without forcing app to quit ...
App has been incredibly buggy the past few weeks.. one of the main issues that I've been having is missing the play/pause button. I've also had music that I've never queued playing in the background and I can't stop it unless I force close the app.
New update is buggy. Doesn't auto pause when I leave my vehicle. Also I gave to force close the app a few times a day to get it to act like it's connected or the cars media buttons don't work and it doesn't display media info. This wasn't a problem a few weeks ago.
"The app lately is horrible. So many small bugs, the music plays but when I open the app I don't see the buttons to stop or play backwards/forward. Having issues every time I plug any Bluetooth headset. Really annoying"
It's been fine up until the last week or two. Playing a song starts it but the UI doesn't show its playing. Android auto also keeps showing errors all of a sudden and not working.
Latest patch has introduced a bunch of issues. If I leave it running for too long it stops showing what song is playing and I can't stop it using any pause button so I have to close the app. When it's in this state i can't skip songs or view the queue either And if I leave it running for a very long time the only way to stop it is by opening the settings and force stopping the app
The app stops working randomly. And also stops playing the song like countless times. It cannot to car anymore lately. It is getting worse and worse to listen to music on this app. The shuffle button is damn annoying and the display function when the phone is locked does not always appear. It is so arbitrary.
"Mobile app has gotten really bad. Stops and starts, play button disappears"
"This app has got pathetic.Iam was premium membership user.As soon as my membership finished,the app has started to show its true colors.The pause and play button or the skip button just dosent appear now.I have to restart my phone every time while just to listen to the songs.GREAT BUSINESS TACTICS FOR FREE MEMBERSHIP(Especially after you leave PREMIUM!!)"
"Resent update has caused app to lose major functions. 1) listening to song and random stops/pause track. 2) progress/sound bar in app and notification drop-down not showing so unable to pause or next track unless tapping next song manually. Please patch asap, long time user and this is first time it's caused the app almost inoperable for continuing use."
The app has completely stopped working. Crashes and requires a restart every time I open it. Seriously considering cancelling my subscription.
The music isn't playing! I've uninstalled and reinstalled; I've even restarted my phone. I have no idea what is happening. Edited 4.12.22 It keeps stopping the music while playing and not showing anything on the lower part of the screen while in the app. Sometimes the buttons don't even work!
"The control bar keeps on disappearing. Once I start playing a song, I can't stop it. There's no pause/stop button. The only way to do that is by restarting my phone. Please solve the issue."
I cant fast forward or skip anything. Song wont show its playing. Cuts out extremely frequently to the point im probably going to switch to pandora soon. This is ridiculous. Im paying for this? What happened all of a sudden? I cant even listen to white noise anymore to help me sleep...it just wont allow me to set a sleep timer. This whole experience is officially ruined for me 😞. Here i come pandora
Have to Uninstall and reinstall every few hours of playback or play/pause buttons will disappear and app becomes wonky/unusable. This used to occur every 2-3 weeks which was fine to deal with but recently it has become a daily occurrence
The play/pause button no longer shows up on pixel 6 pro
Every new update makes the experience of using Spotify fundamentally worse. The latest version struggles to play audio in the background and is unusable if left open but not used for 5 minutes. Horrendous UX.
"Ever since the last update, it has been very glitchy even when I've opened the app for a while. Does not display the music control via Bluetooth despite different audio systems. Unable to see the play/pause/control buttons on home screen. Please fix asap!"
Whole app went to trash. Play button disappears. Music skips. Not sure why I'm paying for this.
"Removed the Android widget. Removed Car view. UI is garbage overall. Your product development roadmap sucks. Every update makes it worse. You keep bugging us to enable invasive Bluetooth device sharing on every app launch, with no option to definitively say no. The playback controls now disappear during playback. Seriously, heads need to roll on your development team."
Where's my play/pause buttons etc? They disappeared can't see what song I'm playing either etf Spotify???
"Play, pause, or skip buttons recently started to dissapear often that it forces me to restart the app so I can control what's playing. If it continues, I will cancel and just use YouTube music app."
New update is terrible. Songs fail to play and when they do they fail to stop. Along with buttons not responding. App worked perfectly on previous version and looked better too :(
Forever glitchy. App play button and current song playing disappears and i have to constantly restart the app. This app has a great track record of poor updates.
Bottom row with Play / Pause buttons randomly dissappears and the only way to get them back is by restarting the app.
"Hate this app. I have Spotify premium and it's a good service, but the app SUCKS. Especially for podcasts... the UI is bad, and I want to dismiss suggestions. There's podcasts that are always on my home page that I will never listen to, and I can't make them go away. Seriously poor app."
"This app has continuously been glitching to the point I can't even listen to it anymore. There is only so many times in a day that one can Uninstall and or clear cache then reinstall, log in etc. Only to have more pausing and down right no play. It often turns on by itself randomly playing things listened to in the past. It often plays without a pause or stop button. Often I can't see the video aspect. If it wasn't for The Joe Rogan podcast being exclusive to spotify, then I would of canceled"
new update ruined spotify!! when playing music the bar doesn't pop up at the bottom of the screen to fast forward skip or pause. secondly. the music constantly pauses if the app is not on my screen or the phone is locked. if this doesn't change I will be forced to give my money elsewhere for a service that works!
"Buggy as of late. The currently playing song will repeatedly have no media buttons/album art and you can't stop it once it's started. Cleared cache and done a full reinstall, still behaves the same."
Having the same issue that everyone else is mentioning. Have to restart constantly just for the player be visible to control. Often times it will stop playing by itself. Clunky UI etc. Please update ASAP ..
"The last couple days the app is completely bugging out, plays music some of the time but the controls act as though it isn't. Clearing app/ restarts don't fix it. Completely quit working on Android auto at the same time. Please fix asap, can't use it as is"
Play button keeps disappearing. Audio keeps skipping. There is something wrong with the app. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. I have turned off battery saving mode. I have tried with data and with wifi. Started about 2-3 days ago.
I've had to uninstall Spotify because for 2 months it's been randomly playing especially when I switch apps since I jnstalled the latest Android OS. I've uninstalled and installed several times. I haven't received any useful solution from Spotify customer support. It's becoming a nuisance and I'm now considering other music services though I'd rather have Spotify. I hope Spotify support reads this.
"Usually apps should get better with time, Spotify manages to defy the norms and has manage to degrade spectacularly over the years. Bluetooth connections cut in and out and it sometimes doesn't recognise controls from the car. The app is so bloated and clunky. It doesn't even know its playing music sometimes, it plays even when the app is off. A quick glance at the forums and people have been having the same bugs for years. Desktop is just as trash."
"Has been good for the past 4 years I've been using it, but recently it'll play random songs that aren't in my Playlist and aren't similar to the genre at all, will skip songs without me hitting the skip button, close the app without me doing anything, or just won't play songs at all. Please fix this. I will be switching to a different streaming service for now"
"I'm not quite sure what happened, but since the last update, the music player stops randomly, the on-screen controls disappear/won't remain. Feeling like this isn't worth $10 a month..."
Since the latest update the play and pause buttons disappear all the time.
"After update app doesn't show up the bottom pannel with artist, title and play/pause button. You need to reopen the app so it appears again."
"Spotify has been so buggy lately - it keeps pausing/stopping by itself - at the same time, the actual pause button doesn't work when you want to pause/stop your tracks (I've had to turn my phone off to stop my music). I've tried clearing my cache, restarting my phone and uninstalling then re-installing the app. Please fix :-)"
"Please fix the app. Control button does not show up and unable to pause a song, you actually have to force stop the app which is so annoying. Samsung S21 Ultra."
"""Spotify is trying to play"" Seems like every new update makes the app more unstable. Why is this extremely high-profile app the ONLY app on my phone that still gets frozen with audio playing audio, requiring force stops? Why does the ""now playing"" ui disappear so frequently? Why is the gesture behavior different on songs with videos attached vs regular album art? Why is it so difficult to manage your library, especially when the automatic features are so inconsistent?"
Samsung S5Neo. Huawei P10. LG V60 3 different phones. Each have the same issue of the control UI completely vanishing. No way to control the music. I have to force quit the app up to three times to bring the UI back. The drop down notifacation area doesn't even show the app running. It like a ghost app. I pay for a premium service. I expect a premium service. Fix it to get your 5 stars back.
"Horrible UI oversights. Have to close and re-open the app to show currently playing, if it ain't broke don't fix it!!"
"Ton of people having the same issue, randomly stops and doesn't have the control bar at the bottom. Yesterday the controls disappeared and I stopping stop it playing without force quitting the app. Not good enough can I undownload the last update?"
"Very glitchy for the past week. I have to force quit every 30 minutes and that only fixes it half thw time. This is usually my go to app, but if they don't fix it soon I'm moving on."
"App has been getting worse for years. Play/pause button just disappearing was final straw, Spotify is literally useless right now. How can such major bugs get past testing? I'd be embarrassed to be a programmer for Spotify."
"I pay good money for this garbage app. That, I do believe, is about to end. I am constantly having to close out and even uninstall this app. It just suddenly quits playing and the bar that displays which song is playing disappears. I used to love Spotify. Now it is a nuisance."
"I love spotify, but the app is awful. It often just decides not to load pages at all, or lag out in other way. Recently, when I play a song, the sound plays but nothing in the UI changes (I.e. it doesn't display the song is playing, meaning I can't skip the song or change the shuffle setting etc.). Very infuriating that such a popular app could work so badly."
Spotify is no longer showing the pause button. So I can't pause something when I need to. I literally have to shut my phone off to turn it off. Debugging is needed.
"Podcasts gotta go!!!! Stop showing me podcasts!!!! I pay money to NOT get ads, this includes PODCASTS!!!! Why is this still a thing? I pay for an Ad free subscription and you keep giving me stupid ads for podcasts. I don't listen to podcasts. Get rid of all ads!!!!!! Also this app is screwing up lately. It's playing over other stuff with no way to stop without quitting the app."
Last release has so many bugs someone should be fired. UX/UI people should have never let this be released. Paying customers deserve better.
PLEASE FIX! We are losing the play/pause button and have to completely close out of the app to get it back. The music is also playing over phone calls or any videos. Please fix asap tired of my ear drums getting tortured when I go to answer a call
"Honestly Spotify was just fine but now we have to pay to listen to songs of our choice. It just ruined the whole mood now I can't even continue to bear with this because these songs that are chosen, I haven't even heard 😶"
Worked fine untill recent update. Now the app never remembers the Playlist that was playing the last time the app was used and have been having constant playback issues that end up requiring the app be force stopped before music is able to be played
Doesn't work well past few days... it doesn't open panel with play pause and switch song button.... whenever I eant to switch the music off I have to restart my phone otherwise kt doesn't stop.... and music keep stopping for seconds....tried to uninstall and install again but nothing works
"Update ruined the app AGAIN! The recent update has caused major issues including no navigation bar when playing music which means you can't pause, skip or see your que. The app now has major issues connecting to Google Home and Android auto. Please stop making updates that make the app unusable. Some of us pay for this service."
Fix your app or your not getting renewed in May. I pay more than other apps to allow you to use an outdated UI and the short cut bar doesn't load half the time. Premium subscription isn't worth the money. Fix it or lose to others. Your call
"Most recent updates brought a lot of inconvenience on all platforms. Crashes and unresponsive -- requires you to kill the app to fix it. Worked well before, but not as of this review."
"FIX YOUR BUGS PLEASE, and the app doesn't ... Ugh.. there's not even a feedback button anywhere"
The player and widget in the Spotify app is now dissapearing (in app) or becoming unresponsive (widget) since updating. I am using a Samsung note 10+ 5g running UI 4.1 (latest OS)
"More and more it just stops working and I cant look up any more music without force stopping the app. In addition you cant auto organise your library when using a desktop app, which is a baffling omission in an app designed to look up music and save playlists. The app has continued to get worse incredibly. Suddenly the bar showing you the track currently playing just sort of gets bored and disappears. Want to stop the music? Time to force stop the app the again! How do spotify get away with it?"
"One plus 6T. Bug, no longer able to scrub through content as the podcast episode UI doesn't update. I can hear the audio but am now unable to use the media controls. Edit: Now the play bar at the bottom wto navigate to the song you're playing is missing. Can you please test some more before releasing updates perhaps."
"Have to force stop and clear cache about twice a week now, very buggy for what it is. It also hates to cooperate with it's matching app on the galaxy watch. Update 11/04/2022: Instead of those issues being fixed we got new bugs. Music playback stops constantly for no reason. App fails to load on many occassions. Closing all apps on android crashes the app, this doesn't happen with other music apps. Media controls often require multiple key presses before working. Downloads run only if open"
Podcasting is still so bad on Spotify. Hard to find new shows. Still no on and off switch for video. Just bad design.
"Constantly randomly stopping, disconnects from my speaker or car, no longer stops when headphones are unplugged. The currently playing no longer shows what's currently playing and the play/pause button does not always work. The last update destroyed the usability of this app. 10/10 would not reccomend there are apps that work out there. The above review still stands 2 years later and the issues with an unreliable app have only gotten worse. Considering stopping my subscription."
"Latest version (Mar 30th) is really buggy. Songs skip over wifi. Tracks aren't shown while playing. Playlists don't load properly, and car mode doesn't work. Whatever they changed, they need to revert the build and thoroughly test before releasing again."
The playback buttons are missing in both the app and notifications. There's no way how to stop a song from playing other than quitting the app completely. A bad taste podcast I don't listen to keeps appearing and displacing stuff I listen to in my Good Morning tab. It's is a buggy app with terrible customer service. It takes over an hour of chatting to conclude they have no clue how to help you. They disconnect you without saying goodbye or asking if there's anything else they could help with.
This app SUCKS. If it would quit crashing and shutting down every 3min while I am walking listening to podcasts I think the actual app would be great..unfortunately it doesn't stay running long enough for me to know
"You have made the play button disappear! I can't see what track is playing, not in the head up menu or in the app. What a huge oversight to make in an update. Deezer here I come. Other problem is link with google assistant. Potentially useful feature, but only seems to work some of the time.... its the promise of it playing, then not, that is the bugbear!"
"Ridiculous amount of bugs for a premium paid app. Can't pause songs anymore or see what is playing have to go into settings and force quit the app every time, when playing through Bluetooth and change songs it starts playing from the phone and have to reconnect the device, downloaded songs won't play without an Internet connection so what's the point downloading them. The worst app I pay for by far!"
"The most recent update has made this app a nuisance to use. If not fixed soon, I'll be switching my family to another service. Bluetooth glitches, music force plays through phone once disconnected from the car, then can stop or change music until the app is force closed. Straight garbage..."
"Stop asking for Bluetooth permissions! This needs a ""Don't ask again"" option not a ""Maybe later"" one. It's such a sketchy af attempt at building up their tracking network using Bluetooth handshakes and collecting more data."
pause/next track buttons missing since update on Android. Have to use Force Stop. Same on my wife's and sister's phones.
"I just heard an ad for COAL, are you kidding me? Subscriptions are too expensive for what it offers; over time I could own all these albums for less money. The UI is clunky and the design is outdated. List changes in What's New, I want to know what you're doing on my phone."
"Just when you think they can't make the design worse, they do. And this trend has went on for years. Heck, Adele herself had to ask them to remove the automatic shuffle feature that literally nobody wanted but that was imposed on all albums. This Latest version is even worse...there are no play/pause buttons. Instead of giving a certain bald& noisy podcaster 100 mill they should focus on getting their Schmitt together, having a working app. I'm going to defect soon, when I have time to export."
"Can someone help me my spotify dont work all of a sudden i even reinstall, log out and back but that didnt helped my liked songs and playlist dissapeared i even canceled my premuim plan cus i thought if its back to free it might show but nope it got worst"
"App has a few bugs on Fold 3 and Galaxy watch 4. Quite frequently the bezel does not work on GW4, and have to restart the app for volume adjustment to work. Also frequently music is being played from Fold 3 but the spotify app says music is paused. This is just BASIC playback control Spotify, for a premium service this just isn't polished enough."
"Terrible UI, desktop version is 10x better. 6 SKIPS PER HOUR!!?? Just use the mobile version of YouTube or use the desktop version."
"Pop up ads on the Premium ""ad free"" subscription are a constant intrusive nuisance. Interface is getting increasingly bogged down with rubbish recommendations that are clearly paid for by labels. Furthermore, the fact popular artists are leaving in droves due to their business practices leave you questioning why you won't leave for Apple, who at the same price and with better functionality actually treats artists with a modicum of respect. Used to love Spotify but now actively despise the brand"
recomendations are based on geolocation and not from the songs I liked. UI awful navigation
"I have not subscribed to Spotify premium,cz I don't want it. But I think the tactic Spotify is using to force people to buy Premium subscription is by bullying them into it by progressively annoying ads after every other song. Atleast you used to provide 30 min continuous music before. It ruins the whole experience especially since I have my exams and I used to play calming music. So here you go, I'm gonna uninstall it now. This tactic is purely abhorrent."
"New update, where has the pause, now playing, stop start button gone. Dreadful update, have to fully close app to stop."
Buggy as hell. Randomly stops playing and the controls keep disappearing. The lyrics to some songs don't load at all. I lose all my downloaded music every time I update the app. Takes forever for local files to show up on the app. That's just some of the bugs. The user experience and recommendation algorithm sucks too. The homescreen won't quit trying to push stupid podcasts on me. Accidentally payed like a second of a podcast and it didn't leave the top of my homescreen for months.
Why is liking the songs so difficult? Should not be a 3 click process. I love what you do but the like button was way better in 2019. Downloads keep disappearing and its a waste of data. Was traveling. Day 1 used 90% data to download all songs and day 2 the downloads weren't there. Do better.
"Spotify is posting false ""scientific"" propaganda about Covid as ad links between my podcast episodes. (Except Dave Ramsey is correct on the economics of Covid shutdowns.) Podcast feed sometimes fails to include all latest episodes, as if some are being censored for Spotify's political reasons. Buggy. App cache seems to get corrupted frequently. Behaves okay for a while after cache delete. Sleep mode sometimes turns off by itself. Downloaded playlists are often ""lost"" and require re-download."
Free version is a pain in ears nowadays. ADs r sucking irritating. Try to create value for more more customer acquisition. These things literally making us apart.
"New update has ruined app. Can't pause playback outside of app anymore. Often stops playback for no reason. Click to play one podcast or song and it will randomly start playing another. Won't load downloaded content when there's no Internet connection, which defeats the object of downloading things. Also I really dislike the new display of my library, it makes it much harder to find podcasts I want to listen to. All of this was fine before the update, please fix!"
Latest update ruined car functionality. Cannot recommend. I just want the app to work like it did a month ago.
"Suddenly Spotify won't support Kenwood, JVC or Alpine car radios. I was informed the company has no intention of fixing this problem. I bought a $1000 radio with Spotify built-in then Spotify discontinued functional support for it. I am really quiet pisses me off. Spotify you need to fix this! I have paid your $10 a month for years. This is the thanks that you gave me. Subscription! $10 a month and can't get customer service or good service 🙄!"
The ads are so intrusive. Not only do we get ads from Spotify but also from the podcasters themselves. I'll be looking for an alternative platform. They hid the pause/play button while playing an ad today.
They hide your dislike button so you have to keep skipping songs that you don't like
"I used to love this app and am a premium subscriber, but Spotify has become almost unusable. It crashes, loses functionality, and randomly skips on a daily basis. I either have to restart my phone or stop the app to get it working as designed and promised. I have reinstalled a few times and that doesn't help. What a sad death for what had been a valuable service."
"It's a great app, I was always pleased with my media library of 1k tracks, selections of the day and a user-friendly design. But because of some political games, to which I personally have nothing to do, the managers of spotify decided to leave people without access to music. I suffer from depression, and the only thing that made my life better was the music. I don't know how I will live on, but the deterioration of my mental health is on your conscience. I hope, you're happy with your decision."
"I like spot very much but am a little perturbed. I lost a quite a few songs from one of my favorite artists, Miranda Lambert."
"One of the worst apps:*Not able to log in with email link or password. *Songs stop playing on its own after I minimize the app. *Keeps showing dowloading in playlists even though I have already downloaded all songs for offline use. *A simple add to playlist button is missing since years, we are forced to go through long process for that. *After this I am not going to renew my membership, as app has started to deteriorate over the years. And no action is taken by developers."
"Nobody wants you to add stuff to their playlist, it's quite frankly, stupid, and unnecessary, don't add stuff to our playlists. You aren't improving anyone's experience, you're making it worse, stop forcing us to shuffle our music just because we don't have a subscription to premium, if I was in charge of your company premium wouldn't exist and there would be zero ads and we wouldn't add stuff to people's playlists, or force people to always have shuffle on, you don't deserve any attention."
"Got premium hoping that i would get more control over the user experience(ability to decide what i see on my homescreen etc) which i soon discovered is non existent. Reading their replies to their dedicated users on their community page, it is obvious that Spotify does not give a damn about what it's users want when it comes to minting money. Can't believe that i did not do my research before putting money in this sinkhole. Anyway....learnt my lesson. Won't be renewing my subscription."
"They dropped aftermarket radio support, so my Kenwood, specificly designed for spotify, can't play it anymore. I reverted to an old update so it will work, now daily mix plays literally the same stuff across all 6 every day, it's slower than a snail, and just bad. I pay 10 bucks a month and this is how I'm treated!?"
Great music app to use but im switching to YouTube premium for more benefits and mainly because there are a couple songs I really like I accidentally hit the cancel button on so I can never play those songs again. Please make a way to check the list of those songs that were canceled and a way to uncancel them then I will get premium again Also premium cost way to much there should be a way to cancel the premium through the app. Unless you have premium i suggest another app
Really disappointing as I often use the browser app. Can't play a single song without it being in a shuffled play list. Can't listen to an album in order either. It's actually amazing how badly it's designed. I'm just going to use sound cloud and YouTube from now on.
It is April 2022 and it still has the same problems as last year. What is the use of offline downloads if you can not access them when you're offline? Why am I still getting ads even though I'm a premium subscriber? How is it you can pay Joe Rogan 100 million dollars but refuse to fix this buggy app? Does it take the another class action lawsuit for you to act and do your job?
"Used ro work fine..for the past few months it will randomly stop. Or the display that allows me to pause/play media doesn't show... I used to use this app much more, now it's becoming a headache. I'm a truck driver so I can't stop to press buttons and open apps while driving."
Not a good update. Last update took away the pause button. Why? I use to listen to my pod cast and pause if someone was speaking to me or to answer the phone. Now you can't do that. I dont even think you can rewind or fast forward. It is so frustrating when they take something that is perfectly fine and screw it up.
"App is popular and good for what is designed for. However, its car autoplay function as soon as Bluetooth is connected is incredibly annoying. Whats even worse it start playing even app is closed and have to close all apps or force stop it and there is no obvious option to turn it off. There usually are a tirade of swear words trying to turn it off especially when connecting Bluetooth just to answer or make a simple hands free call."
Playlists are not getting updated on all devices. Problem with playback on PC version. Premium version deletes all downloads when the app is removed from quick access or Phone is switched off/restarts.
"At this point you might as well make even using the app a paid option. Seriously what the hell is with the playing a song only in shuffle mode, spotify used to be such a great app to use, now you can't spend a single minute in it without getting frustrated. You got your money by playing a ridiculous amount of ads that already ruined the experience for the user you had to ruin it even further by taking out such a single option to select a specific song to play without paying. Corporate greed man!"
"Total garbage app. Besides the commercials, it's stuck on shuffle which obviously ruins the experience the artist intended to portray while ripping off the artist and making albums practically unlistenable. Plus, it uses tom tom technology and makes everything sound like a cheap a.m radio."
Sucks that it limits songs skipped. Makes it take a lot longer to develop Playlist or even have music you like added to the account. There are other services which algorithm works better and sometimes I've even found new artist on other stuff like pandora quicker than being restricted through this service. Dislike is sometimes there then not there. it don't accept credit card.
"Great selection of music, generally usable - though recent UI changes have made things more difficult. The big issue right now is it will not let me download playlists or podcasts u less I enable downloading over cellular - even if I am connected to wifi. I am a premium user and this is going to waste my data."
Hello Spotify! This app is not very well because I can't see shuffle button Grrrrr.. I HATE THIS!! PLEASE FIX THIS OR I WILL REPORT THIS APP😡
"I very rarely leave reviews and if I do, they're almost never negative but I feel compelled in this instance, as the Spotify app has got to be the worst app I have ever used. I'm on pay as you go with no Internet access unless I'm on Wi-Fi and all I use this app for is to listen to podcasts which I download in full before my work commute. It's obvious it simply has not been designed with any consideration for a user like myself. I would go as far as to state that it's terrible for podcasts in general, regardless of how you use your phone. To give you some examples: 1. When I'm at work, my phone will connect to the work Wi-Fi. There's an internal authorisation process to let devices use Internet when on the company network. What happens is that I can't play any podcasts if my phone's Wi-Fi is on - I press the play button, but nothing happens. I have two phones, one authorised to use the network and one not and this happens on both of them. I think what is taking place in the first instance is that our heavily filtered network will not let Spotify download ads and it completely throws it out of the loop. In the second instance, I think even though my phone is well aware it has no Internet access (despite being connected to Wi-Fi), Spotify ignores this fact and still tries to download ads before playing my podcasts. So every time I'm still within the huge range of my company's Wi-Fi, I need to disable my phone's Wi-Fi before I can play my podcasts for the commute home. After they start playing, I'm free to switch the Wi-Fi back on. But this isn't even the worst that this app does. 2. Quite frequently, right when I leave my company's Wi-Fi range (it always happens at almost the exact spot down to a few meters), the podcast that is being currently played will stop, losing its progress and the next one on the list will start playing. This is especially aggravating when I'm in the car and switching back to the podcast I was listening to and then finding the exact spot where I finished is impossible to do safely without stopping somewhere. But this still isn't the worst of it. 3. Recently the app started to randomly show all of my podcasts as not downloaded or actually deleting them (I'm still not sure what exactly happens as this only occurred 3 times so far, but all instances within the last month). The first time it happened, I've noticed as I walked out the door for work that my podcasts were gone. I had to redownload them all before leaving - I'm fortunate enough to be in a position where my bosses don't care what time I clock in but otherwise I'd probably by quite irritated. The next couple times it happened as I was trying to play my podcasts on my way home from work - but in those cases, when I got home, they annoyingly again started showing as downloaded and I could play them with no problems. Mind you, I have 40GB of free storage on my phone. And then there's the absolutely shockingly unusable and ugly interface (but I suppose it does fit the terrible Spotify logo). Manually removing a downloaded podcast from my playlist and downloads is an unintuitive multi-step process. I can't even change the order my podcasts will play in once they're on my playlist. I couldn't find a way to loop the playlist either, so if the last episode on your playlist is the first one you'll want to play, then you'll have to manually start the list from the top once it finishes. It can be supper annoying if this happens when you're on a motorway. It's like whoever created this app hasn't actually used it. It just blows my mind that a company as big as Spotify can't make an app that works, is usable and doesn't look like it was designed in Excel (actually, you can do much prettier things in Excel than that)."
"App keep on crashing and playing songs on its own.Worst experience since the last update, if enable download my liked songs then whenever i am connecting to wifi it's again and again downloading those songs. Daily it's using a lot of data. So now i have disabled that download button. If i haven't bought the year long package would have stopped using this app. Wynk is better than spotify in this case. Giving two stars for podcasts."
"Bad design that tries to force you into buying a subscription. It's fine for me because I mostly use it on PC and am already paying for premium. But the mobile App is built like the most scummy trap. It will try it's best to frustrate you to the point that you'll see no other option but to pay. Also: The amount of ads in the free version is RIDICULOUS. I'm talking 2-3 ads one after another, each unskippablenand 30-60s long. Usually blasting obnoxiously loud music into your ears."
Crashes. Now playing button disappears. Won't play downloaded songs without cell service. Podcast episodes Restart randomly. Refuses to launch.
"Worst money controlled art app in the world. Arrogant, bully and only focused on money making. The worst user experience in the whole industry! Please don't use this app, find replacements, it's not good for anyone - to you because they control what you listen, to musicians because they are paid cents for each streaming and to the whole art, digital and open market because it loses a million in quality with this kind of apps!"
"My keypad and navigation buttons' vibration turns off when I use it and won't come back on for at least five minutes afterwards. I've tried turning the setting off and on again, but for some reason nothing seems to fix it and I just have to wait it out. Edit: Please for the love of god fix this. It is driving me batshit insane."
I don't trust apps that let you use a premium version for a month and the takes it away from you. I never signed up or anything it just pretended this is the way and the took away. Finding another way to listen to music please people stop using spotify so it dies it doesn't care about user experience just manipulation t get you to buy the premium
"The fact that I'm not allowed to choose which song I listen to and instead have to listen to a playlist completely ruins this app for me, and if it is possible to choose a song, it should be more simple as to how you do so"
"Here me out, this app is absolutely amazing ngl. But this latest update is just stupid and ignorant. We can't skip the music for more than 6 times? Really bro? So you forced us to buy a premium? Come on now, change this ASAP. I know you guys need money but this is too obvious, this is just greedy. I'm genuinely dissapointed."
"Last update has essentially rendered the app unusable. When something is playing, there is no bar to show progress, nor to allow pausing/playing of the tune. Only current way to stop something playing is to quit the app!! Have also lost access to all the other functionality normally available when a track is playing, eg sleep timer. Please push a patch soon!"
Requires maintenance. Have to reinstall frequently. Gets sluggish and nonresponsive. Gets worse every week.
Constantly crashes and deletes my downloaded podcast requiring me to Constantly burn data redownloading things I've already downloaded
"Won't connect to my Car. I have a Kenwood Dpx in my car that has a spotify connect built in feature, just signed up to premium and I started using the feature more an more and I really loved it. But ever since yesterday, my spotify just says ""connecting"" and never connects to my playlist, the music instead switches to my Bluetooth and comes through that instead, this is bearable, except I can't skip or change playlists on the fly anymore. I have to use my phone. Not very safe is it."
Randomly crashes. Can't open app without restarting phone. Crashes when trying to set storage to SD card. Logged me out and doesn't let me log back in. Overall terribly buggy UI.
"This new update designed for my type of device is trash, it doesn't have repeat button, add to queue option and seems to control all the music I listen to by giving recommendations even when I didn't ask for them and I can't even control myself made playlists which is making it every difficult to do anything. When I go to the settings there are no options to change this, please fix this because I honestly love Spotify and seeing it like truly frustrates me"
"There should be a ban on commercials featuring the sounds of people eating with their mouth open, or a report button so I don't have to hear McDonald's most disgusting commercial ever again. Premium on pause since yesterday and this is the first commercial thrown at me, can't even avoid it."
The shuffle button might as well be the repeat button because I swear to God!
"Cant use the app without service, even if you downloaded all of your music to your device, plus my accounts been hacked into twice now, and customer support has done absolutely nothing to help except offer to delete my entire account and start a new one. I have thousands of songs that have taken me years to aquire and you want me to just delete it all? There's nothing else you can do? For $120 a year for years, I didn't expect to lose it all."
"Wasn't even gonna use the app since yt music is alr alright, only got it for a quick experiment. Turns out you can't dislike music and there's no lyrics option, what a trash up that can't get the fundamentals. And i think without premium it has adds and you can't repeat music, cant believe this trash app is as popular as it is, stupid people"
"For an app that's about audio be it music or podcasts it is missing the mark by a long shot. I'm very hard of hearing and the volume on this app is atrocious. I can't listen to anything unless I'm in a quiet, noise free room. No amount of setting adjustments help. Edit: down from 3 to 1 star. Chromecast is premium feature only, disgraceful moneygrab. Free membership is extremely limited. Can't even use Chromecast to help the volume issue especially for podcasts. Not worth the download."
App is garbage. UI is terrible. Podcasts stop half way through for ads and never starts again. Hard to listen when it shows played after only 1 hr of 3hr podcast.
"All of the controls are gone, both in app and in notification bar. I can start playing something but to stop it I need to force quit the application. Also podcast will randomly stop playing roughly every 15 minutes."
"Quite possibly the worst music listening app. I can only shuffle play songs, and can only skip a few times without a premium membership. What's the point, when I can't even choose the music I'm listening to?"
"This app is still garbage. The player won't show up, or will freeze on one song. Can't use this app half the time the way it's supposed to be built to used. Tired of this Spotify. It may be time for another streaming service for me. Your user base has a higher standard than this."
Spotify was good but don't know what happened from the last month. After each song you have to listen to the repeating advt of 30 secs and that's quite annoying!
"Asked me to rate it. So here you go! My biggest app pet peeve? Asking me to rate it. 1 star for you. And the whole podcasting portion is super annoying, it should be a separate app that you can sign in with your spotify account, or better yet, just give up on podcasts already. Axed their entire comedy genre and replaced it with podcasts of stolen content so they don't have to pay the artists, presumably. Just the scummiest company and app, quite frankly."
"App is getting more and more unstable with every update. My latest gripe is a bug (I assume?) that changes my storage location for downloaded songs from my sd card to my phones memory, which essentially bricks my phone until I uninstall the app. Has happened numerous times in the last few weeks, it's quite the nuisance to redownload 20+gb and go through installation every few days"
some people are charged 9.99 but I'm charged over ten dollars each month with no explanation of why. that app constantly quits. I'm looking for a music app that won't screw me over every chance they get.
"On the computer Spotify works like a proper music player. The phone app however, doesn't. You can't search for a song and play it directly, you have to add it to the Playlist first and you can only skip 6 songs per hour. Designing the User Interface like this is incredibly annoying."
The ads are quite too frequent. Its really annoying now!!! I'm going to uninstall the app
Do you offer free lessons to learn how to use this app? It's not intuitive at all and useless for not premium members. You play what you want and not what I'm clicking. Give me a break!
"This is a sad story how a favorite service became the worst. You ditched your loyal audience, who had premium accounts, leaving them with free one, where you can't normally enjoy music, even choose a track to listen to and quality of sound is quite worse than other services provide. Such service which doesn't think about it's customer can't be lovebrand, your reputation is spoiled forever."
"This app needs work. I can no longer see the song queue, and after so many, many years of asking by thousands of Spotify subscribers... there is still not a single button to easily ""Clear Queue"" with one click."
"I have rated countless apps with good stars, yet I have never found an app worse than this. When you search a song and click play, it starts up a completely random song and will never play the actual song. It even requires wifi so it's not like you can listen to music anywhere. Not a great music app and wouldn't suggest it to anyone... take my advice and fix the app."
"maybe design an app that actually works and plays music?? idk. literally what am I paying you for, you morons, go back to school and learn to code!!"
i pay for premium service.. so why is there over 1 minute of advertising on all podcasts?! ....jams on Pause when bluetooth to car. what a mess i pay for each month horrible paid user experience
"Very bad aap , lots of ads. Requires lots of internet to listen music . Onces the music stops because of network issues it takes lots of time to play again , even when the network is good"
"For a couple of months your app is unstable. Multiple times I had to re download all songs. Multiple times I was unable to log into my account. Today I tried for 6 hours, no recovery email, not connecting to the internet. This was the last time it ruined my workout session. I think you guys are too occupied with Barcelona sponsoring, to care about your app or your paying customers. So you can find other idiots to support your company for the future!"
"I'm sorry, I'm glad and happy for all the features. But the thing that ruins it completely is the fact that it adds stuff to your playlists, without asking, and you can't even remove it. Wth. If I wanted that I'd download Pandora. C'mon."
I have thoroughly enjoyed my Spotify account until it was hacked now I can't get any customer service to resolve the matter. You have to have an account to access Spotify and if your account's been hacked how are you supposed to access it. Very poor design for customer service.
"I want to buy premium student with debit. I tap the button ""via visa/debit"". But the page show ""with Paypall payment"". Tq"
"Used to be a good app but now songs don't load for no reason and say I'm offline, my songs don't show up in my Playlists and the app is crazy buggy. Quit overupdating the app before properly testing for bugs."
Where is the shuffle or repeat button? I can't see the radio button. Is this a joke?
Rating 1 star until the app works with my Kenwood radio's built in Spotify app.
"Why do they Refuse to describe what the constant updates are for instead of a egotistical statement, trust us.... App is too large trying to do to much and CREATES A DANGEROUS clutter for driving. How many accidents do you CAUSE? I'm a Premium user yet hate the over complex interface. Need a simple large button car mode! It's a phone app not a studio! Bloat ware"
"Do you want to know what it feels like to get shafted by the label industry, the talentless hacks who have used their sheer American greed to lobby the government and ruin the music listening experience? Download this app and don't buy premium. The only reason I'm using this over SoundCloud is because Spotify at least let's me listen to official music for free. Expect to have random songs play in your liked playlist because listening to what you want to listen to would be too nice for us plebs🖕"
"Can't simply add an artist to a playlist to play all of there music, forced to add every song individually. Adding an add all button for artists or albums would make the app exponentially better"
App used to be snappy and fun to use. Now it's slow and I can't like songs anymore. some songs won't download. lot of issues with performance on a snapdragon 855. the redesign made finding my stuff in the library take longer. it just plain annoying to use the app. I will stop paying for premium. I would not recommend using Spotify unless you have to!
"Offline music requires internet to start playing. Funny feature... A lot of bugs, every release."
"Bad UX and seious lack of customisabilility. 1. Prominently promote podcasts and film music both of which i have never listened and have no interest in. No way get this app reflect what i want to listen 2. UX impossible to get a listview of the songs of an artist that is longer than 5 songs. Why id there ""no load"" more button like for the ""see discography""? 3. Sharing playlists privately not possible they become public and get spammed by others For a paid service i expect a little more effort."
"Spotify Free is an absolute scam designed to pressure you into buying, the admittedly very good, Premium by restricting basic abilities such as choosing what to actually listen to and by flooding the app with ads. Absolutely horrible experience unless you pay."
At first it was four but now it's three. Why? I was playing song on my favorite playlist and some random song that I don't listen to pops up and I can't turn it off! It's like your eating your favorite food and someone swips it and put a different meal. It ruins the whole vibe. Especially when I'm a christian playing worship music. If this continues I'm deleting this. Spotify you lost me😒
App has been real buggy lately. I'll be listening to a podcast and then hit the back 15 seconds button and it'll automatically start playing a podcast I'd listen to the day before or previously.
Offline literally does not work and requires you to connect to a network then set offline mode. 0/5 what am I even paying for???
"Currently on a Premium Duo free trial. We won't be renewing when our free trial ends. With Spotify you can't access your library of downloaded episodes without using up your mobile data (and it uses a lot). If you've got no mobile data left or are in a poor-reception area then tough, you can't access your downloads. Spotify know about this ongoing issue but they still refuse to do anything about it, but are still quite happy to increase their subscription prices for those easily pleased"
Spotify site for upgrading to premium making it virtually impossible to do so. Not sure if it's the extra recent step of the banking authorization to stop fraud that's come in recently that's causing this. It's not normal for a big company like this to have problems with the billing side of things. Spotify was a great app but it would appear work is required on the payment side. My advice.... till Spotify get this problem sorted keep your money and try another company.
"They ruined the app with new ""features"" Sitll the 8.6.0.830 is the best version to use, no gliches, no adds evry 3mins into a song."
"Doesn't work on Android. So bad now that after over 10 years of a family account we are leaving. Firms this size should consentrate on longstanding customers. Don't release broken aps or change design usage to frustrate customer experience. And most importantly, answer and fix. Forums are not the same as customer care!!"
"My ""Year In Review"" playlists are absolute BS, the app just plugs random trashy American pop songs that I've NEVER listened to. Edit: Changing review from 2 stars to 1 star. Why are so many of my previously played now ""unplayable""? I'm on Premium. I just want to listen to Icelandic pop, but you're racist. You don't allow it, simply because of where I live. It's disguised as a 'geo-block'. No. It's 100% discrimination & xenophobia. I don't want to use YouTube Music, but you've given me no choice"
"Congratulations Spotify. In a recent update you took advantage of the notification permissions given to you and made it impossible to dismiss the playback notifications, requiring a full force quit if the app to get rid of. Notification privileges revoked, and here's a 1 star review too."
"It literally tortures you with ads about how annoying ads are ! I mean literally it defeats the purpose , there are quite a few useless ads and it can be stupidly irritating ar times that being said it is a very good and easy to use platform for music"
"no looping for mobile, really? You let pc users get the loop button and you put this in the app store, yet there isnt a loop button in sight on my phone."
"No, I will not buy a car thing! Spotify it's it's unlimited wisdom decided to cut support for Spotify connect on car head units without ANY discussion with head unit manufacturers or the general public. They wanted to quietly try to force everyone to buy their stupid ""Car Thing"" which is ugly and expensive and does nothing that Spotify connect didn't."
Genuinely insane this company has so much money and they can't make an app that can stream music over wifi without skipping. Subscribed for years with zero problems but they can't keep up.
The interface leaves much to be desired and is very limiting. No real way of managing your p/aylists for instance. Just heard about Deezer. it has a well thought out user experience and more music to boot. Made the switch and have never been happier.
I would prefer to give zero stars but not an option. Your asinine choice to stop allowing YOUR PREINSTALLED APP on aftermarket headunits to stream and force your customers to purchase YOUR aftermarket car play thingy is ridiculous. Why would I add another random piece of equipment to my car when everything worked perfectly before? Taking my money over to Pandora and I hope others follow! They still support their preinstalled app on the aftermarket radios.
I don't like the new design can't control or see what is playing
"Nothing wrong with the Spotify service, but this android app is not great at all. I've been a premium member for quite while, and Spotify seem to manage to break something when they update it. I've had random playing of music without me asking it to, notifications that won't go away, and the most recent update has ""deprecated"" car stereo Spotify control / Spotify connect completely, so now doesn't work (there's a thread on Spotify forum about it, but nothing is happening in a rush to fix it)."
frustrating UX and they keep flooding me with podcasts i don't want to hear. switching to other service
"They fixed where videos would restart after an advertisement finally... But they still won't allow me to watch video with Bluetooth headphones, I guess so you can't watch video while driving? My phone doesn't even have an Aux port. Googling shows that for many years people have been complaining about it on their forums, with patronizing responses from the Spotify team. ""Oh video doesn't work? Try turning Bluetooth on."" Otherwise good App lol."
This new update completely got rid of the current song playing and the play and skip buttons. It's completely missing. No way for me to pause or skip at all. I have to close the app completely to get it to stop playing.
Newest update ruined app you can no longer stay offline for 29 days before updating the songs to play after 3 days your library of music wont work.
What's going on with this app. Downloads are saying expired and nothing plays except a few songs that seem to repeat. This update has ruined the app. I have a friend at work where his is doing the same things. Give an opinion to uninstall last update. Uninstalling the app and reinstalling does not fix it.
"I'm a SPOTIFY PREMIUM user. The app has ebcome quite irritating. I am paying for this and still not getting proper glitch free app. I have fast wifi. Everything works just fine but spotify shows ""no internet connection available"". I can play the songs which i haven't downloaded by clicking on the available playlists on home page but cannot access the search section at all. Why is this happening??? Why is it showing no internet connection while it can play online songs but no search section???"
"Spotify is useless, I have had real difficulty in getting it to play on my android phone. It is practically impossible to get ant guidance from Spotify. Avoid at all costs"
"For the past 2 days now my app has not working properly, there is no play button or screen to control the song. I've made sure the app is up to date, but this continues to happen."
Spotify I hate you. Your team changed Spotify now people can't listen to music they can only listen to the short version of it. You people just ruined everyone's fav platform for listening now everyone has to purchase premium to even listen to a single song. I loved Spotify but now I hate it with my true heart. And 92% have no money to buy premium frick you Spotify.
"I cant play my own playlist without other songs - that i didnt add myself - play instead of my songs. I also have to pay just to use the ""previous"" button? Ridiculous. Anyway, podcasts are great, i just hate how i have to pay to listen to songs in a normal way as other music playing apps."
"the app was amazing at first, and then the update ruined it! i cant play any song whatsoever. i cant even listen to my desired songs because spotify keeps adding random songs to my playlist! i am very disappointed because spotify was my favorite app."
The lyrics won't show. There's no button that leads me to the lyrics. I have premium. I Uninstall Spotify and re-download it too. The result was the same. No lyrics.
"It keeps forcing me to use premium. For example, whenever I next the song, there is an advertisement. The songs on the album cannot be seen for preview. It'll only show when ""I go to premium🤌 I can't choose my song, so whatever it plays after you tap the play button, gou just need to accept it."
"One of the worst music streaming app. Only plus point is larger library of songs. Ad experience is worst of all the apps i have used. I can't even see all songs of one artist. Like, seriously??? You can't even do that? This should be the basic. All other apps have better recommendation algorithm, more features in the app. What an inefficient and user-irritating ui."
this app got so annoying when it last updated it just show that Spotify just is so eager for everyone to buy premium now you can't even play the songs you like I might quit this app
"When you selected a Song, Spotify will play a different one for you even though the Song Title never changed. The App was for no use at all. It'll require you to subscribe for them in order for the listeners to listen to the music they want, and they wants us to PAY in order to use the application functionally. Youtube Music allows listeners for a free stream by watching ads/connecting through wifi. Why can't you?? This remains as a display on my phone. Might as well uninstall this useless platf"
"new update literally broke group sessions. no more Spotify codes, everything ruined."
"Its adequate for listening music, but they take songs on and off more than a girl on onlyfans. I accidentally press the heart instead of the pause/play button many timesand its super annoying. Like others say, the UI is getting worse and worse. I was in love with Spotify one year ago but now I absolutely hate it. The ""shuffle"" option is the worst randomizer I've ever seen, it literally plays the exact same song not even 10 songs later.. I have over 1K songs in my library."
this app Required Premium to turn off shuffle. THIS IS VERY BAD because It will choose Random SONG. I will give 0 star but I can't. i will give you 1 start instead.
"The app is completely user unfriendly. They boast about being able to listen on one device while controlling it with another but that works maybe 20% of the time, the other 80% you're dealing with UI glitches and playback issues. I love paying for premium only to be met with issue after issue. You can barely listen to the music you want without problems."
When I first joined I didn't know I was put on a premium trial and was very happy enjoying the app but as soon as that ran out without warning I was left completely confused and its frustrating I can't actually pick the songs in a play list I want to hear in the moment. Also now I get given like 2-5 ads at beginning and end of each song or every 2 or 3 which becomes annoying and ruins the mood. Also you can't even rewind the song your on.
Full of adds and u don't skip adds buttons
Edit: i cant log in... great service but each design update worsens the app. First the search bar in playlist was moved into the three dot menu and now they mashed up my podcast and music library... I want them separated and not together...
"Uninstalling because of so many ads. And premium is also very costly, will build a new app same as Spotify algorithm and that too free. See you in market Spotify."
"Horrible. Ad after ad after ad. Gave me a 30 minute ad free ad, then ONE song, and then another ad. Doubt much of the money spotify is making off of me is going to the actual artists I like. Can't even tell what songs are in an album in what order without getting premium. Awful user experience."
"The search button in Spotify does not work...and moreover when they give Spotify ads between the songs, they say that there will be 30 minutes of uninterrupted music. But after 10 minutes another ad starts."
My music is on shuffle when I didn't turned it on and I don't even have a shuffle button
"Keeps logging me out of my accounts, all my correct passwords and emails dont wont on it. Ruins my day."
Note to Self: Read comments before updating. I updated this app and my stored login info such as username and password were erased and so were my Playlists which took me a long time to build. I guess this is the end of my run as a customer and I'll go back to Pandora
"If you pay for Spotify, its a great service. The user experience is frustrating a LOT of the time, though. The app will struggle at times to stay sufficiently connected to the internet and will stop playback at random when this happens. Playlist shuffle is rarely a realistic shuffle, and a lot of generated playlists will end up repeating a laundry list of a lot of the same songs in a genre. And sometimes it decides to simply forget a lot of what you had saved. This app needs better maintenance."
How is it that an app this popular and big be this buggy. It has unintuitive or inconsistent UI and crashes frequently. Sometimes signs you put for no reason and won't let you sign back in.
"I used to love this app, I've used it for years. Recently though it hasn't been working properly. It glitches and all of my music that was downloaded isn't anymore. I have to re-download them and that takes forever. I have to wait hours and uses a lot of data. It logged me out recently and it has never done that before. I tried to log back in a few times and it would not work. I reinstalled it, finally it worked but now all my song aren't downloaded. The recent updates ruined the app. Please fix"
It has quite a few bugs such as playing music that has nothing to do with the playlist especially around December with all the Christmas songs and everyday I have to deal with my Spotify deciding to log me out the later deciding it wants to log me back in :/
"Signed me out and won't let me sign back in. Plus every now and then when I pick a song to play from my liked songs, it will play for a few seconds, and then for some reason change to a station based off that song. Gets annoying quick."
"Wow, this app is beyond bad. Genuinely feels like parody. A child could make a better app, you hiring monkeys over there? Can't believe anyone's silly enough to pay for this. Spotify, quit buying exclusive rights to things if you're too incompetent to make a working app. Creators, quit relegating your work to Spotify unless you want your career to die. You're too old of a company for this to be remotely acceptable..."
It would be nice if the app worked for longer than a week. I pay 10 quid a month and often get precisely nothing out of it.
"Spotify is an amazing app, but I've just got an error that put me back into sign in. And since Spotify doesn't let you make a password when you create you account, I've been trying to sign in via gmail but it keeps saying ""something when wrong"" over and over again. And when I try to sign in by the ""log in without password"" thing, that leads you to your email to get a link, every time I try to press the ""go to Spotify"" button it just says ""link has expired"". FIX THISSS!!"
Random login required. Can't login through fb as I was used. Website nl does not work. I pay for music I can't listen to while driving.
Keeps logging me out of my account and then we get the problem that the button 'Log in without password' doesn't work
"they ruined my login..i keeps saying failed login even tried many ways,uninstalled and reinstalled again and still the same problem..spotify becoming shittify"
"(premium user for years) Not only is Spotify one of the most horribly bug-ridden apps I've EVER seen (i work in tech, as well), but the company are downright thieves. Stealing from artists and now stealing from me, since my account (which is still being paid for) apparently just can't be logged in to! ""Check the help area"" is also a dead link, almost like an extra middle finger to their paying customers. Genuinely, why do i keep giving these people money, and why does anyone else? Awful people."
"Spent several years building playlists, used regularly, and then the app decided my account didn't exist anymore. Can't log in. Can't recover it, and I'm not wasting time rebuilding everything I've built. Pandora or YouTube it is."
"I pay for premium and it just keeps getting worse, first a couple of buttons stop working, then it would stop randomly in the middle if songs, and now I've been logged out of everything and it won't let me log back in."
Tries to make you accidentally press a button to pay for a month's subscription using your last payment card if you have unsubscribed.
"Doesn't have the same options that primes has but prime also doesn't have what Spotify has? Sux either way, but now won't let me log back in"
"The app sucks lately. The play button is all white, you can't see the state, and you have to tap on lyrics if you want to reach the playing bar so you can go forward. Please fix it ...it's very annoying."
"Buggy as hell require a lot of full phone reboots. Edit, also sucks when I've pre down loaded a podcast but still need an internet connection to get it to start playing"
"After the last updated the scroll bar just stopped working on Android phones, it stays hidden on the side which is a pain to move to a specific letter index, you just can't! Also the search/short is so much on the top that if you are on Z letter it's easier to close the app and open again than scrolling all way through the top, again since the scroll stopped working. You could at least give the option to the user to choose the old layout, the UI is so messed up right now... Hope you fix this."
VERY BAD. The new UI makes my head dizzy. I can't even play A SINGLE SONG without shuffling it. Fix ur app
"You should be able to see an artist's songs from their profile instead of using guesswork and sifting through albums, nevermind the whole Premium shebang. And getting local files on is such a hassle What absolute dunce came up with these UI designs? Terrible and asinine design."
Constantly deletes downloaded songs. Unintuitive user interface. I am considering switching streaming services just because of this terrible app.
Feel sad for android user as a non premium u cannot choose any song u want to listen to... in my ipad I can without premium. Completely sux n pointless to do that to android
Scan to join used to be super simple. Literally a click of a button I can point and scan my camera and done. But now I need to send a message and have the person click and confirm to just waste more time??? Please go back to the old ways with a simple point and scan.
No matter what phone or how many times I update the app is buggy as hell. They should start paying me instead with the amount of bugs and glitches the app itself has. Only spotify of all the apps I have is the biggest annoyance. So with the latest hpdate now I dont have the ability to scroll down my list of 4000 songs like I used to before the update now I have to flick for like a minute or two to find my songs from back then. Seriously spotify quit removing features for no reason.
"Why the hell did they make the only play button automatically shuffle, this is terrible design"
"Shuffle sucks. I didn't make an 1800 song playlist to have the same 50 songs cycled over and over because it isn't actually random. Offline sucks too, half of the functions stop working (ones that shouldn't require internet). Sucks that Spotify is gonna go the way of Skype. They got a massive headstart but don't seem to care about making a product that anyone enjoys using."
"It requires the premium version for basic listening experience. You cannot listen to full songs of your choice, you can't skip, you can't make playlists. It's basically useless if you don't pay."
"If it ain't broken don't fix it. Refusing automatic update is no longer an option, stopped playing mid song and I came in to the app on a loading screen, Google play tells me I have the latest version, even if as late as yesterday, the update button was there for this app (I didn't click it). (latest bug added - can't search within a track while playing, pausing resets playback time (soundtrack has to be paused to change time in song)"
"I am not able to listen songs, it says no internet connection even though net speed from my side is quite stable and good. It was good intially but now iam tired of those notifications, also it says that not correct password when I try to log in through my mail plz help me ASAP."
So damn glitchy these last few updates if I wasn't paying for premium id uninstall tapping the pause and play button does nothing half the time. And audio keeps playing when I turn off my Bluetooth the other day I had to restart my phone to get it to stop closing the app didn't even work
You ruined the app. I can't listen to any of my own songs and you just dump in song that I don't even like!
"Nothing ever works right, I have no play button right now, no control buttons at all still playing, can't shut it off. Podcasts just stop playing in the middle then reset the whole thing"
"Used to be such a good app. Now the functionality is horrendous, cuts out all the time, pause/play buttons dissappear randomly. What on earth have you done?! Cancelling subscription in a month if no improvement."
"I love spotify, especially for music but after many years we are still stuck with MP3 equivalent sound quality, even with my premium subscription! Tidal, Apple, Amazon, Quobus all provide Hifi / CD quality sound but Spotify are lagging behind. Spotify made statement mid 2021 that they would release a 'Hifi Tier' towards the end of 2021 but failed to deliver with no answers as to why. If anyone from Spotify actually reads this please update us on why the 'Hifi' tier still hasn't been released?"
"Spotify is designed well, but is incredibly buggy on Android. Ive had a number of problems keeping things downloaded as well as music not playing after the first song. I've tried various fixes (restarting my phone, changing settings, etc), but after months of these problems Spotify just ain't it."
"You guys make an update and I'm unable to log in to my account and without that I can't listen to my music. Had to uninstall and reinstall, then all songs needed to be downloaded again😡. Thanks for ruining my gym workout!"
Currently playing music does not display at the bottom of the app or in the notification shade. Requires a app force close or device reboot to get it working again.
"Every time the app gets an update, it somehow gets worse. It used to be simple and intuitive. Now it's even broken. After the latest update, the offline mode no longer works. I have downloaded my whole playlist, but if I turn on offline mode, according to Spotify my library is empty. I can't play anything. The heck?"
"Every single time they change the UI (which is every other month) the entire app breaks, this time queue's arent a thing. They either dont add the song, replace any songs youre lucky enough to get in a queue bc they only allow one song in each queue or it lets you make the queue but as soon as it comes on it skips everything"
Too many adds. Use to love Spotify for building Playlist and was okay with a couple adds about every 30 minutes. Now I get 8 ads in 30 minutes. Just flat out ridiculous. I usually just go to pandora now due to this.
"What the hell? I loved Spotify, when my dad paid premium but now we have Apple Music, I wanted to keep using Spotify but the free Spotify is horrible! They only let you use 6 skips per hour, removed 70 hours of MY playlist, remove the go back, repeat button and doesn't let me download anything! Worst part is, I can't listen to ONE song without having it on a Radio shuffle! I'll keep using Spotify, if they make better choices for the free version, if not, I'm staying to Apple Music!"
"The last few weeks trying to play spotify through Bluetooth devices results in constantly going quiet but still playing. The ads have also increased, I just want a few hrs without ads than spam them all you want."
"Don't beat yourself a up. GPM hit the nail on the head with simplicitly. There's too much wrong for one message. It cuts out. No play button. Integrates poorly with phone theme. Missing songs!. Missing lyrics. Repeated playlists/radios. You redefined what a radio is... If I have to listen to bill withers after sitting on a dock one more time imma flip my lid... Hopefully your dev team is better than YTM, certainly won't be going back there! Sincerely, a loyal and dissatisfied customer."
"Sometimes doesnt let me play music offline. It needs me to go online to be able to play my downloaded songs. Also they made scrolling to your downloaded musics harder, you have to scroll manulaly instead of having that designated scroller that lets you go to which letter the song starts. I'm on premium and the features and UI feels bad to use overall."
"i really hate to listen songs on spltify, this app's ads ruined everything"
"So now when I try playing anything on the app, it won't pop up on the background or anything. I can't edit or rewind or skip my music anymore. Pretty sure the new update ruined it."
"After the new update, ""What's New"" button DOESN'T work. It says ""something went wrong"" and ""try again"" does not work either. Fix this pls"
It's my favorite for music and Podcasts. However this Joe Rogan bull$%@ is exhausting. I canceled my premium family account. Quit spreading misinformation about covid. Also it is now super glitchy. It plays music when I'm on a phone call and then I can't turn it off without shutting down the whole app. Ready to be done with this for good
"I used to pay $11/mo to be shown unskippable ads on my podcasts, sometimes 3 in a row. Not anymore! Goodbye Spotify, it was great until you turned it into a dumpster fire of ads and bugs. New best friend: Google podcasts. Spotify ""originals"" are overrated. Stop trying to actively ruin the podcast space."
Where did the buttons go? I can't pause or skip any songs!
Spotify UI is cluttered with podcasts. Keep seeing racist and hateful pods recommended.
"Cancellation of plan is literally not possible, the options where I should be able to cancel does not exist, the quide redirects me to broken spotify links."
With every update the ui has gotten less user friendly. Also there is no way to get to your playlist raidos now with this past update without a long press on your playlist then selecting the station. Ux has been going down hill for about two years now hope google gets it together with youtube music soon or that spotify decides to care about the complaints that its user have had for the past few years. Update still in a decline.
Can't pause podcasts any more. It doesn't bring up the play tab nor does it give me a button. I can only pause if the audio device has a pause button on it. Information Galaxy s21 ultra Android 12
Worst ui I've ever used. Try to listen to podcasts and it will literally skip to the next episode and loose its position. I don't understand how an audio streaming company is so bad at streaming audio
It requires an internet connection to play my DOWNLOADED podcast.... Free premium trial spam every time you open the app...
when i use this on my cromebook it keeps crashing and i have to wait for 3m just so i have the button to close the app plz fix this i used to love this but now its kind of upseting
"First impressions matter, so the blank screen upon first time login is not a good look. Consistent blank experience and broken back button, this app has zero content beyond login. Well done on your engineering prowess + a lot of alcohol consumption by the NY execs."
"The queue button doesn't appear anywhere on the Android mobile version. This is terrible and annoying. Random songs also get added automatically to your playlists. This is clearly an app intended for you to buy the subscription, but even then it has annoying ""features"" like this. Terrible. I would have bought the premium if they a least had a freaking queue button."
At least add some new advertisments I am bored with old ones If you want to listen to advertisment please download this app. I stopped using ganna because of this and now spotify is also acting up lately. Really ruins my mood when ever I catch the flow . Worst app I will rather use you tube to listen music . I literally loged in with my other google ID to write this review before everything was fine so wrote a good review but not so much now. You should look into this more.
the ads are terrific I got five 30 second ads in a row that were unskippable also some times you have the opportunity of seeing one 30second ad or 6 five seconds ads so the skip ad button is useless it usully adds some to yout playlist that you do not add and worst of all sometimes when you click a song IT PLAYS A DIFFERENT SOND INSTEAD! Spotify is just garbage
Quite good. 3 stars because it pops very often ads for artists that you may don't listen to them and in mobile version you can't listen the song that you want.
Please make it easier to remove previously listened to songs from playlists - especially those pertaining to ones played from Google homes. My family has my daily playlists ruined and I can't change it. It's awful. Please help
"I don't know what is happening but Spotify is coming up short. I can't pause songs anymore, I have to quit the app to get it to stop playing. My music randomly stops playing. It's becoming unusable and I pay for it! I'm not happy."
"This app is complete trash, deleting. New update ruined it! Thanks spotify."
"Hey there, to whomever is reading this, please update your app as I've realised a recent bug from your app. Whenever I tried to delete apps from the search history, I noticed the songs do not seem to be gone and I have to press the Clear Recent icon but the songs still do not seem to disappear. Only if I go back to the app, then the songs dissappear. Please fix this as it's quite annoying. Thanks"
"Has been fantastic for years. Recently, app will close on its own, pause button isn't available, several other issues."
"I've really enjoyed the spotify app and have had a subscription with them for years. It's great, you can listen to and download songs for a very low price monthly. But they recently censored Billie Eilish's song Happier than Ever. Which completely ruins the song and was entirely unnecessary and wrong. If they're going to start censoring art then I'm going to find a different music streaming service to suit my needs. One that doesn't censor artists and gives them a fair share of the profits."
"In Bangladesh you guys should setup proper payment system, 33 % vat & tax via prepaid recharge?!! Why ??! This is ridiculous! I will be stop purchasing premium after that term. Spotify should we add some option via mobile payment option for easy . Another problem, I am a running student university and I cannot access my offer ! My documents genuine but it's all a is verified fail why ?"
this updated version is not quite good songs are just in preview menu is just aargh! am just mad
"Can't get this to work on my second phone, and that wouldn't be a problem if they didn't have crummy tech support. Crummy tech support just ruins any experience. I don't want to chase down solutions and when none of them work, there's no solution cuz your customer support is non existent. It's kind of like thinking a democratic politician has good intentions, but you know they don't."
"Keeps crashing if i even so much as think about skipping a song or pressing any button. I can put on a playlist and let it play fine, but it crashes if i try to use the app while playing music."
The amount if ads running every second you play a different song is ruining it and you'd probably be better off with band camp.
"I'd give more stars if we were given some info on what the upgrades are when they're available. A quick description would be really helpful, it's silly that such a large app doesn't do that."
Worst app. Keep on pausing a song. I have to click the play button 100 times and I am tired of this. Update this app big time.
"The app is run by people that elevate the voices of bigots and rip off artists. I switched to Tidal. It has a vert similar interface and just as many songs, without the gratuitous use of the ""n"" word, referring to POC as apes, grotesque misogyny and objectification of women, public health misinformation, etc."
For the last few updates I constantly lose control buttons both on the device and any Bluetooth devices I connect to. Only way to fix is to force stop the app or restart my phone.
I left YouTube music for that same reason because nobody was fixing the prblm but they had no prblm talking my money every month please don't tell me that I made a mistake by subscribing to your app fix your issues ASAP !!😠😡🤬 it is feb 2022 and my Spotify account was working but a couple of months ago it stopped working it won't show the play button I have uninstalled and reinstalled still doesn't work fix asap I don't appreciate getting ripped off every month !!
This app is awful. The play button is sometimes there sometimes not. If you download an episode of a podcast it does not matter because you can't use this worthless app if you don't have data. Just awful.
Stopped paying for the app due to the stopping in the middle of a song or podcast. This has been an issue for quite some time and no fix has been provided. App is not worth paying for until its resolved.
"WORST APP EXPERIENCE EVER!! PLATFORM IS FULL OF RACIST NONSENSE, HARDLY WORKS, MUST BE DESIGNED BY SOME USELESS IDIOTS! Poor user experience with premium. I pay to be able to download songs to listen to offline but when offline the app now won't let you play the songs you already downloaded. App has been getting worse and worse, slower and slower these past few months and now this. I want my money back, do not use this service!"
"I continue to experience bugs with this app. Although I will be playing a podcast, the app says that nothing is playing. Therefore, all the controls (pause/play/rewind 15sec) are greyed out. The only way to pause what I'm listening to is to force quit the app."
Constantly stuttering and that stupid shuffle button can burn in hell.
"Really gone downhill since shoehorning in ""podcasts"" and UI redesigns"
Unable to QUIT Premium STOP doesn't work.and there is no way to cancel in the MENU.
"It's clunky and not intuitive. Pauses all the time for no good reason. Will stop functioning properly and can only fix with a phone reboot. Nothing about the way its organized is intuitive. Really wish Rogan wasn't stuck on this platform, but money talks baby!"
"They've just about ruined this app. Super buggy. Unintuitive UI. Half the time, the play button doesn't work. I have to force stop the app to get it to work again. And their recent changes to accessing podcasts and downloads makes finding downloaded episodes so incredibly comicated. The old way was so much better. I have no idea who's making these decisions but they have horrible designers. Edit. They've somehow made this worse. No podcasts work anymore. Offline mode doesn't work half the time."
"Spotify needs to consider the UX aspect of UI/UX. A dressed up pig, no matter how pretty, is still a pig. There are MONTHS of detailed bug reports for their recent ""improvements"" on both their forum and on Google play store, made by paying customers for both mobile and desktop, that Spotify is clearly ignoring. (And just why doesn't Spotify have a dedicated bug reporting system?!?) Their offline mode requires going online every time...the claim of staying offline for 28 days is BS."
"I was excited to download this app; music is a LARGE contributor in setting my mood for any situation. Unfortunately, I quickly became disappointed with the Spotify app as I was reading the reviews. In all fairness, I did only read the first 10-15, but it was enough to decide at this time Spotify is not for me. The majority of the reviews had 1 star, and a couple had 2. I appreciate everyone's honesty! I'm not giving up just yet; I'll keep watching for better reviews. Thank you!"
Fix your app instead of adding pointless UI updates. It worked perfectly fine. Now it's utterly futile. Cannot show what I'm playing with other devices consistently unless it's a podcast. Genre sort in liked songs is all sorts of broken
"To pause it, you literally have to reopen your phone and go to the app. It doesn't have any quick controls like every other audio app in existence. Plus it supports Joe Rogan."
App stops every 5mins. Been doing this a while. Gonna cancel subscription if its not resolved quickly. 11/12. Still does the same thing. $10.isnt much but Spotify expects its full amount I expect the app to work fully. 2/19. Still stops constantly. Do not pay for it. Absolute garbage.
Cannot swip down in liked songs using letters now in the new update. If there are 1000 songs you'll have to scroll down to the last to play that song. Completely ruined the experience.
Last update breaks everything. Home screen starts to lag and eventually app crashes. Please fix it ASAP or I'm not continuing the service.
"I am SO Angry...I pay for this acct, everyone in my family is enjoying it...me after I had to uninstall due to sluggish performances, it doesnt EVEN LOAD MUSIC when I select any song...After so many years building up all my different playlist I fond myself considering going within Apple MUSIC app because I can't enjoyy Spotlight anymore. Sad to be honest, but after multiple emails sent..i am done."
Shows/podcasts that I dont even listen to keep on bugging me and cant remove them. Just add a remove button on things we don't like/want already. Or better yet let users cutomize what we wanna see and hide/remove what we dont.
"IF you're paying for premium, you would be upset just like me. Go to play a song, screen goes off naturally (not clicking lock screen button) and at 1.49 EXACTLY, song shuts off. I know about the ""Saver"" but it's literally not working, still shuts off at 1:49 into the song. Please fix this by next month or I will no longer be subscribed to your premium."
The free version used to be much better before but the update ruined everything. I believe you're trying to limit the features in the free version to make us pay for the premium. That's terrible & not acceptable & impractical. You must seriously leave following your greediness because you're losing many constumers
Autoplay does not work - it has never worked as long as I've been using the app. It's quite terrible that such a basic feature is ignored.
"I should look into getting something better to listen to music on, but Spotify is easy. It is also riddled with ads seemingly designed to infuriate me and pays artists pennies. If I could give it zero stars I would"
Hate the new update to playlists. Scroll bar not working anymore ever since last update. Used to be able to hold the scroll bar and quickly find songs through out my playlists. Now I have to manually scroll past my thousands of songs. Will uninstall
App is not showing what's currently playing or the media control buttons. This makes it difficult to actually use the app
Everytime they update this app it gets worse. The layout is awful. Why would you remove the big shuffle button from playlists and make it a tiny one? Why would you remove liked song counters for artists? Why would you remove the fast scroll from liked songs? Why would you remove the artists/albums/songs/playlists categories from the library and replace it with these awful sorting buttons? The way the app worked and was set up for almost a decade was perfect and now it's awful. I hate this app.
Why is the heart button next to the previous track button on the home screen?.i keep unliking tracks by accident. Fix this!!!!!!!!!!
"Awful, I keep having to uninstall the whole app jus so it will stop playing. The pause button works once or twice then stays on play. There's some great stuff on the app but the app itself is soooo bad and glitchy"
"Look i can't play a song because you remove a play button, and there is a limit skips you have is useless to think, even liked songs didn't have a play button. I wish you rework this app now"
"Worst music app ever! I built a playlist and the only option is to shuffle play. Used to be able to select any song i wanted, not anymore. Way better on the pc than mobile."
Latest update removed the ability to quickly scroll through your liked songs
Upgrade plan issue..!! Upgrade plan not taking immediate effect and this is new invention from Spotify.. subscribed to 1 week ₹25 plan and then upgraded to 1 month ₹129 payment (to avoid mini 30 song restrction) but new plan will be effective after 1 week only .. Really.. get a life...! No where its mentioned on payment/upgrade page that it will take effect after current validity..!! This ruined our 3 day trip ...!! Never getting back to spotify..!! Already subscribed to other music app.!!
"I really hate how it adds extra songs to your playlists. I have to constantly go through and take them all off. I make my playlists how I like them and don't need your input. Also, the ads are far too loud. Why are that so much louder than the music? I have my music quite quiet when using headphones but the ads pop up and I have to take my headphones off because it hurts my ears."
"F this app. At first it was a very good music app, but now I can't listen to the songs I want to, because every time I click the play button it automaticly switches to a completely different song which I have never heard of. Spotify fix your fckjng app!!!"
"Use to love it, now when connected to Bluetooth it gets annoying starts playing music on its own even when app has been force stopped. Each time I play a VoiceNote back from WhatsApp, music starts again. Getting so annoying, I considering cancel and deleting it. Just have a actual stop button or something. Even when using maps each time she speaks it starts up again 😠"
"New updates suck. First my spotify input on my pioneer radio quit working. Now I get the same song over and over again. I've got over 160 hours of music in my Playlist, I shouldn't hear the same song several times in an hour period. Considering terminating my subscription and finding something else."
This app is ruined. Playlists deviate from the songs on them three songs into the list. I changed the setungs to disallow playlists from playing recomended songs. But it still deiveated the same. If this is not fixed i will deleat this garbage app within the month.
Since the new update Spotify automatically has access to personal music files and tries to play them through the app. You can no longer use the phone's built in player to play personal wav and mp3 audio files. This needs to be fixed. Even though I keep turning off the permissions in the app it keeps turning them on.
"This app suck, where is the download button and it play random music when I play the song I want to play not good for new user."
New update is full of bugs and awful design. Scrolling through songs in your library doesn't work and the app will freeze at random times.
"Last update is a mess. Can't like or dislike any songs, new UI is buggy and you can't even play 5 songs in a row without receiving a loading error message."
"Not worth the download👎👎. Waste of my internet data. What's wrong with this app??? I just don't understand, why? This app is not playing any songs, i can't hear the audio. Also when the search result shows, it's not allowing me to click on the song. Another one is that, it's not showing my account name correct. Very trashy app😡👎. I uninstalled it quickly."
Spotify Widget barely ever works. I still have to launch the app in the end to get quicker results. So much for having a widget.
The scroller in the liked songs no longer works. You cannot interact with it. Plus of you have a lot of songs you have to scroll with finger for a while before the scroller even shows on screen from behind the play button. It is fine in any other playlist it seems.
"Selection awesome, waze integration nice, interface worst i have ever seen. Premium seriously needs voice control built in so i can drive safely with out google assistant."
"Used to love this app, but since they started forcing Podcasts into the app, without letting you removing the recommendation and the f@#$ing AI continue to offer me religious and explicit content, I had to move to another app. I was a paying customer, and shame on you for taking a good music app and destroying the user experience. There is a feature request for three years with literally thousands of upvote yo let people remove the podcast section or at least hide some of it recommendation."
"absolute garbage, it was good before they made shuffle and ads after every song a requirement, on pc its fine but on mobile it very different. At this point I can write a 200 word essay on how much it sucks on mobile"
"trash. when first installed this, it went fine and normal. until the update came. i can't pick what to play and i can only play shuffle and you can't press the button to pick another one again. and so much ads :(( Everytime you play a song there's always ads. :(( you can't pick what to play and you always get random songs that you don't even want and you can't even change it :(( i literally have to do everything just to play what i want. unbelievable, im disappointed :< please change this."
"I have to drop this back to a 1 star because of how FRUSTRATING finding wrapped 2021 is. Every time I've had to find it I had to use at least 2 guides and at this point I can't find it at all. How is it possible that a massive highlight of your service just disappears randomly? Is it really that difficult to allow me to see my own, personalised content? Or do I have to go to YouTube music to get a service with features that stay for more than a month?!"
"Spotify info not displaying on car stereo .  The music plays, but no song title/artist/etc. info appears, and I cannot use my steering wheel buttons to control the music anymore."
I HATE how yall make it to where I can't play the song I want to I wanna hear this one song next thing I know another song comes up and ruins the vibe until this no choice but shuffle ends bad review
User interface nests too much. Hard to manage your library. Random UI updates are usually unnecessary are confusing. Cuts in and out randomly.
"About 90% of the app space is wasted on useless podcast recommendations when I just want to listen to music. It becomes a pain to actually get to my playlists. There should be a separate app for music and podcasts, then I might actually use that. Or just let me pin things or hide content from the front page. Also, the app shows annoying popups to invite other people to buy premium, really ruins the experience"
What has happened to this app i cant repeat the song or skip the song . Random songs are added to my playlist i cant do anything i cant even keep it on shuffle because random songs come in there from nowhere i really liked the app but i cant use it now please do fix this and the repeat button is not there i love listening my fav song on repeat but i cant do it now spotify please fix it asap
"❌‼️⚠THIS COMPANY WANTS TO RUIN PODCASTS. Please join the boycott against spotify. Podcasts have always been free and accessible to all. Spotify wants to change that, it wants to make it so that, like a cable subscription or streaming service, you need to pay an app to stream them on the app's terms. Easier monetization because the app corporation pays podcasters for shows and content and you have to pay the app to access anything. They are buying up beloved podcasts and making them ""exclusives!"""
"Edit: It's 2022 and still no quick toggle for offline mode. Also, restarting my phone makes me lose my downloads everytime, so I have to download 5000 songs times and times again."
Such a bad UI. worst app ever for music Switch to YouTube music with much better features and UI. I couldn't play a single song properly in this.
Recommendations are worse than ever. Home screen never shows anything new. And it pushes podcasts so hard. Sick of it. I'm going to quit paying for premium and try Apple Music instead.
Wayyyyy to many ads it's genuinely like four thirty second ads for a tiny bit of music.
"I've had spotify since high school, buying spotify premium provided my first ""bill"" and sense of financial responsibility. I've built a truly sentimental relationship with this music app. Recently joe rogan podcast was censored and I'm leaving spotify because of it. I don't need my developers telling me what I can and can't do. Spotify = Sellouts"
Song algorithm suuuucks. Daily mixes are repteated songs. I'm done paying for a less intuitive platform.
Figure it out. Quits playing after a minute like it keeps picking up the command voice then shuts app down. Have Uninstaller and reinstalled and same issue. Does it on all our phones. Takes 30 minutes to play 1 song because of the pause and play.
Lots of adds. Ruins all the mood of listening music.
"Ek is steering the company into an iceberg and it shows. Audio quality is enough for podcasts, not music -- for the same price, Tidal is a whole new league, even cassettes are better than Spotify. That aside, the UI is pathetically outdated. Ek wants to turn the company into a content producer...by hiring untalented loudmouths - way to betray the people that built the company, buddy! Dump this sinking ship, spend your money and time on something, anything worthwhile."
"From hero to zero! Dear Spotify, Where have you put the speed control for podcasts? And where has the pause button gone? I only see a big green button marked Play, even when the podcast is already playing. The only way to stop playback is to close the app. That surely cannot seriously be your intended user experience. Help!"
"More and more lately its having issues. Glitches a lot, says it's not playing anything but it actually is, controls freeze etc. Requires frequent closing and ""rebooting"". Finally canceled my Premium and deleted the app"
Worst app.. So super slow had to uninstall it even before account could be created.. When u press d create account button it goes on n on.. Jiosaavn is d best.. Create a Good app first then hire bollywood guys to advertise..
Why are you changing the way i can navigate the playlists!? Why is it that i can't scroll anymore!? Why is it so hard to make it good? It's so bad having the scroll bar on the right not even work!!! I have to keep swiping up to go to the bottom... Heaven forbid i have a way to quickly scroll to a section of a playlists. Why not like iPhone with the alphabet and being able to skip to the alphabet sections. Bad design All around!
"This is okay, but the constant ads every 3 songs completely ruins ur vibe u had from the previous song. At times the ads become so annoying that I just go to YouTube anyways"
Lame design. Not enough autonomy to play what you want. Created stations are never like the original song. They promote the crappiest mainstream artists.
why would u guys remove the quick scrolling option from the side?? now I have to scroll manually to the end of my liked songs. PLEASE put it back.
"Reporting bad content especially podcasts is impossible. Looked for a song ""Goshi"" that shows porno graphic content under podcast. I've contacted support twice now still not able to get this disgusting content removed. It's astonishing there isn't a ""report"" button!!! I guess all this Joe Rogan BS has really taken over Spotify QA. TIDAL I'll give that a try"
Need to create a family plan. Very irritating to have the app not work well in the background and constantly quit.
"Unintuitive, buggy, and censorious. Bad experience. No up/downvoting. No commenting. Ads in paid version! Final straw: you removed Joe Rogan videos. Leaving for better platforms. You suck."
Spotify we like the update before. Now we can't play songs anymore without pressies the shuffle button. It's getting so annoying. I hate this update so much. I swear to god i hate this app so goddamn much. 🤬🤬🤬
Only have this app for podcasts that I can't get anywhere else but I hate using it. The UI is horrible. Can't get it to play the way I want it to. Just the fact that they stonewall their Podcasters to not post publicly so they can be the exclusive place for them is bs and makes me angry. Their stance on spreading false news is also horrible. But I hated Spotify before that.
A recent update ruined the group session. Please dont touch things when they work great.
Good algorithm. Horrible hands free ui while running and driving. Unfortunate that theu are comfortable to support anit-vax stand as well
"This jre stuff is ruining my favourite app... (old: Great app, its cache cleaning feature is very good. Finally added lyrics, and it's beautiful and colorful and amazing. Spotify does have some issues when you move out of an internet coverage area. the menus start taking time loading/openin even for downloaded songs & playlists. Also the bottom bar on OnePlus phones cuts the app at the bottom (like a black bar), which doesn't look very good. The bar should have a grey background.)"
"At first dis app was okay but no more.I advice d developer to go back to d former arrangement of songs in d playlist not whatever this new one is. I can't even select a song to be played because it ends up playing only d chorus and stops after dat...it's infuriating.I can only play a full song if I click on the play button at the top of the playlist and dat may not b d song I even want to listen toooooo,so I will have to patiently press next till I get to d song I want?I don't think so."
Why did you remove the like button on the widget for Android ? It's very annoying to have to go back to the app everytime!
"So there's this guy with a podcast who says some pretty messed up things and gives airtime to a number of narratives which cause active harm. Spotify aquires this podcast, and stands by while he continues to say some wild, hurtful stuff. If they're not going to do anything about him, I guess I'll do what I can and use another app for podcasts."
I only ever use this app for listening to podcasts. It won't pause or play when I tap the pause or play button on my Bluetooth headset and if I stop the podcast it will lose where I was listening at
18/06/2019 (5 Stars) : The improvement in UI and the experience in using it improve massively. loves the app! it's my favourite now. 7/2/2022 (1 Star) : The update in privacy to disable sharing friends activity is just stupid. People can just use private session if they want to hide their activity or design a way to hide activity to individuals instead of asking all friends to enable the feature.
"I don't know what this app does. It has some major problem like removing song now and then. I heart the songs and after few time they remove those songs. Then why on the first go u had them uploaded on your app? They were trending songs Remixes, slowed versions etc but i Don't knw what is wrong with this app. Horrible experience and it has a lot of ads. Premium plans are quite costly Also this app doesn't verify my student status i have tried with a lot of docs. I won't recommend this to anyone."
"amazingly bloated and inconsistent. initially a favorite podcast had become exclusive so i installed this trash fire. i didnt realize until after i uninstalled it how much it was causing massive slowdow. presumably from unneeded disk access and background cpu usage. while driving the ui is inconsistent enough that after unlocks it requires a dangerous amount of attention for basic operation. again, only after uninstalling it did i realize how negatively it affected my whole phone's performance."
"Trash app, Even on my own Playlists and Liked songs I can't choose my desired song and needed to be shuffled, oh and what's more is the limited skips. I used to love this app so much because I love listening to music but all of what I said ruined this app. Recent updates just pushes users to buy premium accounts. If I could only give a negative star review on this app"
every update genuinely breaks the app for a solid 2 or 3 days until they patch whatever was broken. I'll still stay on premium because the service itself is great but this app needs better quality control.
"The only problem that i want to suit is the ADDS, There is always adds every next music lol please reduce it tho for free user. It is okay if the adds only appear every 2 to 3 time in a playlist."
"Possiblity the worst user experience ever. If like me you are a random dipper and want to listen to an album/single from your past and not interested in making playlists etc then preserve your sanity and find another method. I normally want to listen to music to relax in the short perios of time I get free, unfortunately this is typically a failure using the mobile app, which ends up in stress and disappointment"
"Fascist trash pulling episodes telling me what I can and cannot hear. ""Keep letting the government dictate what you hear next thing they'll put stickers on your ears, even with that move we got em in anguish, kuz we'll learn sign language"" Geto Boyz"
"Horrible company, horrible app. I've had nonstop crashes, freezing, and just general bugginess and breaking that they have shown no indication over the entire year to fix. Why are you taking all the money from artists if you're not even going to use it to maintain your platform. I guess having alt-right conspiracy nuts on Joe rogan is a more important use of spotify's money in their opinion. Edit: They've updated the app quite a few times now. Broke it more each time. Edit: can I leave -3 stars"
"Cannot play a track on free version, instead if plays something else random. UI is completely useless, there have been music player apps for over 20 years. it's amazing how bad this UI is seeing as there are so many examples of good UIs."
"Bad to worse. Playing offline had been hit or miss. Now, downloaded song are just not available offline. So if you live and work inside buildings, you won't have your music. Been a premium customer for years. Dropping it now. There's no point in paying for a useless app."
"The 30 second long ads every other song might have been barely tolerable-- if I could actually listen offline, AND when I search a song and click on it, it actually plays said song like a person with a brain would have designed it to."
"How does an app that used to work seamlessly turn to a buggy pile of garbage. App won't ""load"" things that are already ""downloaded"" on the app. They take away car mode, so if you don't have a car play feature build into your car you have to open your phone every time to change the song"
Opened the app. Chose a Playlist. Before the music started Spotify played 5 straight commercials at which point I quit the app. I don't get that many in a row on Pandora. This isn't for me anymore
"I love Spotify for the service and features, but the app is such an absolute disgrace that I can't give it more than 1 star. Really, very poor UI that makes me think they actually don't do any kind of testing or research into what users want. Really, really bad."
When i open a Playlist it only gives.me a shuffle button why cant it be like the old one
The new UI design makes it so hard to search the liked songs playlist that it's annoying.
App lags bad on Samsung Galaxy Watch 4. UI is slow. Offline playing is unusable. Complete disappointment on Wear OS. Guess I'm going to go buy Apple products now.
I just wrote a review and as soon as I submitted it required premium to do anything! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
"Keeps constantly shutting off or continuously playing and the buttons freeze for play, pause and loses ff and rewinding options. Got a Samsung S21, that's even the problems began. FIX THE BUG! This used to be 5 stars."
"I want to listen music not ads ,ad ruins the tempo"
"I used to love spotify, but it will consistently play the same song that I chose. It will continue to play one video from a youtuber. ONLY THAT VIDEO! When I try to choose a different video, it will either close the app or play that the same video that I tried to avoid. Nothing works now. The update ruined my phone."
"On iPhone Spotify was working fabulously well , just switched to Samsung on one UI 4 Spotify simply doesn't open only stays on logo tried restarting mobile also reinstalled app but nothing"
"Terrible, can't play my playlist in the order i set it, only shuffle is available, terrible features i can't believe this is the same company that has an actually good user experience on PC. Bring this up to your own standards please."
"Quit messing with Rogan! The only reason Ive downloaded your buggy af app is for the podcast, btw everytime there's a ad it skips to the next podcast and restarts the last one, really annoying to try to find your place in a 3 hour podcast..."
"I can't listen to a song I want to without it being on shuffle. The app was better off without this update on thr interface. For gods sake I can't even skip songs without premium?? OR go back to songs. Update ruined the app, I rather just download youtube music"
I can't be the only person that's having this issue of not being able to listen to my downloaded songs offline. That's the whole reason I downloaded them. It's quite annoying and inconvenient and I hope it's fixed in the soonest
Friends' activities are never visible. Even after all the required settings are turned on. Many more bugs to be fixed :(
"VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO USE, At the beginning it was not like this but now, what the hell is (shuffle play!) l searched countless times but l can't find just one single play button Whenever l play a song some random song play's by it'self and lf go more deep and then again click on the song only main words begin's and then ends please you had to co-oporate with us and people have become so greedy that almost every app includes (sign in, rate us, pay now to install premium etc)"
"Needs a serious update, barely functional. Crashes randomly, play button disappears, nothing in the library section will load offline despite being downloaded."
"From today the app became unusable. I'm on version 8.7.0.1147 It asked me to allow for background activity which was always granted and from then it randomly stops playing, popup being responsive and requires app restart. It seems the cycle takes 5-10min. I might change rating to 3 stars max. I'm a long term premium user and there was almost no change in user interface for years despite so many complaints about queue handling, playlist management, recommendation quality etc. So -2 for arrogance"
"I can't access downloaded music unless I'm in offline mode and sometimes when I turn it on, it still doesn't even work so I have to force quit the whole app. Often it will tell me that I have no internet connection even when I do so I can't see any information about the song I'm listening to or even read the lyrics. I have to force quit the app multiple times in a day to get it to work properly. Terrible app. :/"
Switched from Deezer after 7+ years and very disappointed. Deezer app was crashing a lot year ago. Now was pretty stable. However Spotify app stop every 3rd or so song during playing and require to hit play button again. Running Android 12 on Google Pixel 4a.
Poor music site with bad ethics. They were better in the past but the direction they went over the past 4 years is just a bad user experience. There are better music app services. Don't recommend at all.
"Can you please stop playing music automatically everytime I connect my device on bluetooth? All the settings from my phone ia set to not do it but this app ia very insistent. Very annoying and frustrating! Why don't you have stop button on your app, only play and pause?"
"One less star just for the lack of a clear queue button in the app.. I keep getting the same darn podcast that auto plays.. Glitch city. What is the point of downloading songs or episodes when the app just streams anyway. If I have a connection to the internet, the podcast I'm listening to keeps buffering. If I disconnect, then it runs fine. So glitchy"
Acting weird lately. Issues with the pause button not working. When I first start it up in the morning it will play a few seconds of a song then skip to a different song.
"I could write an essay on this app. Been a member for about 7 years, but as others are saying, the crashes and bugs for the past few years have been unbearable. Takes a long time to load (sometimes as much as 5 whole minutes with the play button pressed but no audio) The search features are also slow or just broken. Just adding 5 songs to a playlist or queue could genuinely take you 10 minutes. It seems like spotify has focused on other avenues that no one cares about and have put music second"
"limited choice of music. Too many features slows down GUI function, i.e more clicks to do what I want than alternative apps. Switched back to free version and cant make anything play within 10 seconds of selecting, which seems a reasonable expectation from a music app. Also profiteering from misinformation."
App stops playing podcasts after 10min Also playback section and time lapse dooesnt get updated? It needs to be force quit in order to have the correct info in now playing
"Promotes misinformation for profit, at a cost of human lives. Also (although a lesser concern), the app UI is just really bad, and they've had years to improve it. Giving Tidal a go and like it better so far."
I hate the design and lack of real functionality in the application. It fells like it has been designed by people who don't care about the end result. Beyond terrible and frustrating on a daily basis.
"Spotify is just an awful podcast player and not a great app for playing songs in general. Simple options to control auto download, reorganize, etc, don't exist. It feels like podcasts are tacked on as an afterthought. They really need to fix this if they're gonna keep buying podcasts otherwise I'm just going to stop listening and will switch to non-spotify podcasts to use apps that work well for what they're designed for."
"Update has ruined ability to seamlessly transition from PC to mobile or vice versa. When you create a radio using a song as a base it shouldn't recommend 30 songs you already like, wasting time."
"Pretty much useless unless you buy premium. I like the UI for it better than other music apps but that's about it. Edited to one star. Not only is the free version butt, they continue providing a platform to Joe Rogan and his anti-science guests."
"My original issue has changed to a new one; now there is no play, rev, ff buttons. It mostly plays without randomling turning off, but I have to close the whole app to turn it off and cannot go back or skip ahead. Sometimes it will show those buttons but tell me nothing is playing (when something is playing) so those buttons are useless."
"The app stops every 10 minutes, gets stuck on one song and the time bar doesn't move. Since the last update it doesn't actually show that it is playing any song at all, when I click on the song it plays it but there is no ⏪️▶️⏸️⏩️ button so I can't even pause it, it needs to be closed in the background. I've had this issues on and off for over a year now. On my galaxy s10 tried uninstalling and installing again, didn't help. Got s21 now and still same issues.."
"Spotify as a database is superb. Unfortunately the app is built like so many these days. Their way is the only way. My biggest gripe is that although I have premium, Spotify will insist on mixing tracks rather than leaving them in order. This is every time I load an album, playlist. STOP trying to make me do what you want. I want a setting to ALWAYS change this. My choice not yours. I am paying for the privilege. I want the ability to fully customise my app. DO NOT TRY TO BE APPLE. 1/5 Score."
"Latest version lost the pause button, so the only way to pause or stop audio is to force close the app. Pretty big mistake there to have this version already lasting 10 days on the play store."
"EDITING THIS ON 01/27/22 TO SAY THIS GARBAGE APP REALLY CHOSE JOE ROGAN OVER NEIL YOUNG?!?!?! GET BENT SPOTIFY. Worst app on the market. Doesn't matter if you pay for premium. The app will close randomly. It will end your podcast in the middle of listening and say the whole thing is played, not saving your spot. If the podcast has ads the whole app will close instead of playing the ads. This app needs an entire overhaul by someone who actually knows how to build a proper player app."
"I used to love this product. Then the gave a ton of money to a guy spreading deadly disinformation on their platform. They are literally getting people killed because of this. There are plenty of other streaming services that are just as good without all that unethical baggage, so I quit."
"Skipping songs you apparently Don't want to listen to is a ""Premium"" feature, what dumbass thought that up? No such thing as playlist editing, just the option of adding and removing song from your playlists. For the size and selection of music available on it, Spotify's design and overall build is a massive disappointment."
"Spotify is digging their heels in to be on the wrong side of history regarding disinformation/misinformation. I had my troubles but overall enjoyed the access of the platform but will be using something else now, not to be a triggered cancel nut but because that's genuinely the right choice with my capitalistic freedom now. Good luck. Be well"
"(NO STAR!) I have canceled my premium acct & they kept charging me, I had to report my credit card lost & they sent me an email stating they're having a problem charging my account so I replied that's because I canceled you a month ago!. I called my credit card to dispute the charge & had Spotify blocked! Google search Spotify & you'll see many people having the same problem. They won't give you a confirmation number or an email confirming that you have canceled your account.Law suit pending?"
"I absolutely despise the latest update. It baffles me people would release this. Spotify is acively making is more difficult to organize your music, probably under the guise of some misguided ""User experience philosophy"". Spotify is actively hosting and supporting science-deniers. Time to look for an alternative. Spotify is rotten."
"I am uninstalling Spotify because you chose a wacko, anti-vaxer, anti-science, proliferator of dangerous conspiracy theories about the Covid vaccine, over a hugely influential force in rock music for many decades with a huge record catalog. I'm sure a deranged podcast is more profitable than classic rock music; but what the hell... Spotify wasn't designed for music lovers, was it?"
Spotify will start playing automatically when bluetooth devices are connected. Nothing has been done about this despite going on for years now. Managing podcasts is terrible. The user experience is awful and it's getting worse the more podcasts are exclusive so there are more pods to manage.
Lately it loses connection and interrupts briefly the music despite the connection being at full speed without any problems! It's very annoying. It ruins all the experience..
"Screw you guys for getting rid of car mode to FORCE people to buy your stupid ""Car Thing"" which only works on premium too. I'm not buying your car thing, and I want the car mode back so I can listen to music whilst driving and have the screen always on, so I can swipe stuff quickly and glance over without having to turn my screen on and mess around with changing songs etc. You're going to cause crashes"
"It was amazing...best app I had ever owne but the new update sucks and because of it its now the worst app Ive had, it was so awesome but they ruined its so bad now, you can't pick what song to listen to, you can only skip 6 songs per hour, and you can't listen to music without a playlist and u have to shuffle them so u can't pick a song to listen to, so I'm uninstalling"
"Can't really find the song/music you are looking for, some of the suggested title are as good as junk. Limited search result for some song/music. Can't find the original song sing by the artist etc etc Try searching this song/music in Final Fantasy 4, (tsuki no akari/theme of love) or ""Say Yes"" by Chage&Aska the result disappointed me. The autoplay track is not useful, i keep getting msuic that is not similar to what i am listening. Have to turn this function OFF."
"After OS update, 1. playback stops randomly. 2. Does not seem to even show progress in UI several podcast episodes later. 3. Premium account refuses to play downloaded albums. (Playlist worked)"
"This app was honestly great but there are to many adds. The adds last for so long and it can be really annoying when I put on music while I sleep. It's also quite sad how I can't even click to listen to my song from the liked list. It just gives me like a 10 second trailer of the song. In order to actually listen to it, you have to search it up.. so in order to actually enjoy your music, you pay for premium."
"Almost useless in free mode, you can't play any song you actually want, only playlists of other songs you didn't want to listen to, and you had to watch a 30 second ad for the pleasure of not hearing the song you want. UI makes everything more difficult too."
"After all this time, how is your interface so bad? Where is the shuffle button???? After I find a song, it takes 3 clicks to add it to a playlist. Half the time I seem to add the entire album. If that happens I have to remove each song one at a time. If you add in album in one click, you so be able to remove it as easily."
"I would give it 5 stars, but if it not for the stupid suggested songs. Please, no suggested songs, can there be a button somewhere to disable it? I don't. want. your stupid. Suggestions. I only go on Spotify very rarely, and when I'm upset and I don't have anything else to do, just because of them. And even after I try to NOT have suggested songs, like making multiple repeat playlists, I still ALWAYS end up in a worse mood then before I am going to delete this fracking app. PLS READ THIS SPOTIFY"
Stopped downloading playlists for offline despite saying downloaded and for some completely unknown reason the like button has stopped working. App used to be great. Turned awful.
"Its keep shut. Look like in progress but it freeze. Tried uninstall and install again, but still the same. Update. Nothing changed. Understand why there is not a button to report a problem. As you may not do anything else."
The free version of the app is trash I don't understand why we have a limit on songs we can pick and we can't rewind them. It's idiotic and its all because they want you to buy premium it's obvious they don't care about what we think and are just greedy bastards looking for a quick buck. I'm switching back to SoundCloud.
What's the point to keep on sending me e-mails about lyrics and nothing is available? The user experience seems to keep getting worse... Might be time to transfer my subscription to another music app.
Obtuse UI. Let me dislike terrible song that play on repeat for no reason. Let me stop the song I'm listening to from ever playing again sometimes I don't like some music and I don't want it shown to me over and over and over and over
Well this sucks now want to listen to music? Well u will get one chance to listen to it for free and screen off no ads after that u cant play it again just boom other song just plays also when u notice u just skipped the song u want to listen they wont let u becuz the rewind button is ded always
"Crashes constantly, doesn't display the podcast you are actually listening to, pause and play button doesn't work most of the time. Trash."
"The app is full of bugs. Autoplay is not working after a song is selected from search. Tried suggested solutions, they don't work. Please fix this. What happens, if you are driving a car? You need to select a new song every time? Other bug, app doesn't quit when you are on home page and press back."
Bring back the option to delete songs from recently play list. I don't buy the BS excuse about testing new features for best user experience blah blah blah. It's not. This is probably a greedy corporate decision to force users to listen stuff they don't want for more view counts.
"I'm quite frustrated with this app; lyrics were added to all of my devices with spotify a month ago, but it still won't update on my phone!!! 💢 Anyone know how to fix this???"
Untill last update it was awesome. But new update is too bad. They made it complex for the sake of design. It's too difficult to navigate between songs while searching
Bruh worst experience ever I can't even listen to a song that I want to listen to without it playing some random other music because it's automatically shuffled and I can't even keep it on loop since their isn't a button for that.
Worst user Interface. They pay out millions but apparently don't pay their programmers enough to make the user Interface Intuitive. Garbage. Spent 5 minutes trying to figure out how to go back to an audiobook on spotify. If it's not possible without premium say so. Garbage. I'll stick with YouTube and their evil overlords
"Picked it up since some of my fav podcasts went exclusive, fortunately it was only for a year as this app is trash. Clunky UI, excessive ads (including inserting them into podcasts which would be ad free on any other platform), and trying to listen to music is even worse (which they pay the artists nothing for). Also I can't directly prove their responsible for Joe Rogan complete losing his mind but it seemed to be around the same time he joined up. Coincidence?"
"So basically if I want this app to properly work, it's come down to me having to wipe all data from storage and reopen it like a freshly downloaded app every day because it's become so buggy, I've been using Spotify premium for years, it's crazy how they've constantly made it worse through non user friendly UI and bugs"
"The amount of ads is insane, let alone the amount of covid ads you receive. My escape from the flood of news is working out, which gets ruined because of the ads. I can understand some ads, but more than a dozen in 30 minutes is ridiculous."
"Not the biggest fan of it. Design doesn't look as good as Apple's. 5 skips in the free version is a just mean to be brutally honest. When I try to open an album... it doesn't open, instead it opens something wierd and I hate that. Then I try to play a song from that album... and it ends up playing a remix (which isn't even part of that album) of the song I wanna hear or just a random track. Idk what Premium is like but free... just SUCKS! That's why I'm giving it 1 star. 😊"
"it plays one song and completely quits, and now it's not even playing my playlist and if im lucky it will play but it plays songs that aren't in the playlist and aren't even similar to my playlist. so, here i am uninstalling AGAIN. it keeps giving like 4+ ads before playing one song and then it plays more ads and just completely quits. fix it, it's become horrible lately."
"It jumbed up all of my song in my playlist, and you only 6 skips per hour!? That's genuinely stupid, soon I'm going to get premium, but if that doesn't help then I'm gonna go back to Amazon Music."
"Possibly the most counter intuitive and useless ""user interface"" I have seen on an app. From colour scheme to positioning of icons it is all wrong."
"Whatever they did in the latest update ruined the app. It doesn't show the music I'm playing anymore, it's just stuck showing the last place in a podcast I was at when I updated. Dumb."
"Everytime I use spotify with my mobile data, it will work at first but halfway through it will stop. I've turned on and off the mobile data but it still doesn't work. My music jamming is constantly ruined"
i don't mind new features like discover but please bring the old design back like in ver 8.5.8 and make the quality of discover is adjustble because i use data and i don't have wifi... i can barely keep up with the subscription and stuff
"Unusable on Samsung phone (works perfectly fine on any other devices I have). On my Samsung flip 3, the app doesn't even allow you to select a song and play it from your liked playlist, or an artists page. For whatever reason, it seems like you are required to have spotify premium in order to play the songs you actually want to play. Yet this has never been the case for me on anything else I use."
Spotify does not update the Blue Tooth Audio display on my car stereo. This quit working for me earlier last summer and has not been fixed yet.
"I have got premium subscription but the playlist just suddenly stops playing... I have faced this issue in even downloaded playists... This happens with all bluetooth devices including earphones, car... You can't stop your cycle and press play button after every song ends"
"Edit: Changed my review to one star after the new update ruined Library function. Please add back the ability to search in a playlist by pulling down, instead of having the find the submenu. It's there on iOs, but androids dont get it anymore?? Stop making podcasts the focus of your app your users downloaded for music, add a button to turn off podcasts, and have a music only mode"
"Gave it a trial to see if spending money on this would be wise. Answer: Hell no! UI is comolez, there is no easy navigation. Sound quality is no way any better. Hiby player is million times better than Spotify. Song collection is still not that good honestly. And the amount of monthly fee is just too much to ignore all the lackings that I'll be paying for"
"Ive been forced onto this. I pay for it as family want it. I hate the shuffle. Albums and playlists are all shuffled. The UI is too simple, you can't seem to configure it to play in another way. Also I play an artist and it adds in others, please no. Bring back the superior Google Play."
"Why can't we manage our homepage and decide which one that we want to keep and which is not?? I accidentally listened to this one random podcast for few minutes and I can't remove it from the ""your shows"" list AT ALL. This is a VERY VERY BAD UI DESIGN. Either fix this or fire your employees who designed this clunky interface. There's no way for me to change this even though I tried with premium subscription, and this is clearly a violation to customer right."
"Shocking. What happened to Spotify? Okay so I can deal with a 30 second ad to have 30 minutes uninterrupted music, but what the hell is with the ""only 6 skips"" thing? That is absolutely ridiculous. Spotify 10 years ago used to be the go to place for streaming, a genuine company that didn't try to rake all the cash they could off people. Now it's just ""pay for this, pay for that"" Been around since spring 2009 but I don't feel welcome without paying. Such a shame, won't be using ever again sadly."
"Always a problem, always songs missing in the repertoire... Every important song from older albums is missing Edit: it's still bad: there is a section in the app specifically designed for the songs you ""like"" from chosen artists. That ""playlist"" adds extra songs in it. Example: if I go on an artist like 2Pac, there are songs from him that I enjoy so I click on like. However, there are other songs, that don't even have the ""liked"" song icon on it but are in the playlist. What's the point? Shame!"
This whole set up with this company is a joke. You can not cancel as easy as they say. For the last 4 months I've been paying for premium service and only getting regular service but they sure is that ain't sending my money back I would not recommend this to anybody I'm fighting right now to try to get out of this and they won't let me discontinue the service so I don't know we'll see if they charge my card again I'll be suing them soon
"Lately there's an annoying bug that will randomly pause whatever you're playing. Seeing as how I mainly use Spotify during dog walks in the frigid Canadian winter, this is quite an painful annoyance. No information I've found online has fixed this problem. Otherwise, fantastic streaming service, and when it works, it works great."
The UI for playback is total garbage and always glitchy. I'm only here for Rogan and I'm unhappy with Spotify. Half the time the video doesn't even show up and it's just audio. Horrible app
"i am genuinely very disappointed in the ads, they come way too often and at the worst moments. i was about to cry but the ad came or i was crying and got interrupted by the ad, whatever the case, still bad. I cannot express enough how much i hate the fact that you have added these ads and i hate them with my whole heart and i hope you stop them. no, i won't buy premium i don't have money for that don't even think about mentioning it. just never dare put ads again they are a very bad experienceto"
"Can't Login on my Mobile device (keeps loading forever). Both Win10 application and webplayer don't play music in given queue, even the shuffle button doesn't work."
"The decision to ""Retire"" Car View without a replacement is concerning. I cannot imagine what they were thinking when they removed the only way to pause/skip songs in the car without pushing the power button and unlocking the phone to try to push a skip button 1/4 the size of a fingernail..."
"Absolute shite controls always lock adds constantly run. Constant interruptions i never use it Plus you ruined the joe rogan podcast for me. Lies about watching video to allow for 30 minutes uninterrupted listening watch this add, then plays more adds after is play fist add. More adds then music selection Plus they ruined JRE"
"App is quiet good, but so many usless and irretating ads forcing to purchase premium version!! Its too disgusting thing I've experienced. Pls don't put too much ads here, those who are interested will purchase the premium version why are you forcing them!"
The app keeps suggesting songs that I have hidden. The app desperately needs a dislike button available at all times that will then skip the song no matter what playlist you are listening to. The hide song feature is also available only on certain playlists. Lastly to cancell your subscription you need to login on a Web browser then confirm your cancellation what feels like 100 times before it finally believes you don't want it anymore.
One star because Spotify did not fullfil it's promise to launch lossless in year 2021. One less star for Lyrics issue. The design of Lyrics layout is not good as compared to other apps. The sync of song with lyrics is not good for many songs. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ To ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Because Spotify improve lyrics.. 👍
"Forward and backward buttons are really broken up in Videos, I'm seeing JRE video but when I tap on backward button, video starts from 2-3 minutes back, instead of 15 seconds. Even bigger problem is, it shows I went 15 seconds back in timer but video clearly had gone 2-3 minutes back without that time reflecting in timer. Button and video length needs to be fixed, it's destroying viewing experience."
"Back to one frkng star. First of all there's the ""Spotify is trying to play"" notification bug. But the very worst of it all: WHERE IS THE HIFI you promised!??!?!?!? Also, I was keen to try out several playlists only to find out you've completely changed the layout regarding the playlists recently. Quit your standard arrogant text regarding new updates on Play Store and get your @!!₩%○°@$ together. Your main strenght was reliability, but it seems you can't keep up with that anymore. Such a shame"
"Don't know why but Spotify is not letting me play music's in my playlist and I can't play songs that I wantby itself, the app just goes on to random playlists. This to me is unacceptable from a music player and quite annoyong."
"I like to stream podcasts at about 2.2 speed. However when using the app, if I cast to my Xbox or my Android TV, I can only do that at normal speed. Spotify has made quite a few of the podcasts I like exclusive to Spotify, but your interface still sucks. This coming from someone who does subscribe to avoid your ads. I prefer Pocketcasts for Podcasts."
"My usual experience with the free version of spotify is installing once every few months, getting so frustrated to the point were I am driven to the point of suicide, and uninstalling the app."
I have had Spotify for some time. But it doesn't work any more because I have no it says I have no internet whereas I do and it's is fine so I can't search up songs and listen to them. And the sound if horrific. I want to listen to songs that I have liked but I can't unless I press the shuffle play button. If I do press a song it just comes up with a 5-10 second part of it. Please fix this because this app is unusable if not fixed I will uninstall. I do not recommend this app
"Why did I give this app one star? Well, because it's very buggy and the app on xbox randomly disconnects or opens the app when I try to use it. Another problem is that I got logged out and can't log back into my premium account. It saids I have a account when I pretty to log in from Google, then turns around and saids the accounts email does not exist. Spotify' audio isn't even as good as Pandora or YouTube, the music being compressed for easier download and quicker play is annoying."
"I've been using spotify for years, and been on premium for atleast 2, although JayZ was not on it, I was cool. But damn I used it for a few days without premium, and man what a disappointing experience it is. Ads every 3 or 4 tracks, like how can a company that deals with music do this to someone trying to listen to music is beyond me. I'm considering moving to Amazon music, you guys are really sick for destroying the user experience. Sick F#$ks!!"
"The free option is not usable because of advertisements played after every song are much louder than the music. It's very irritating especially when you listen the classical music. Secondly, songs played with different loudness even if there are in the same album, so you have to regulate volume quite often."
"This app is horrible I can't backup songs can only skip 6 times before I get like 7 adds. The playlists suck cause songs you don't put in them appear, then you can't even skip them. Most my playlist have only about 5% of my songs in then can't search for song well you can but can't play them unless you have premium I have noticed this app is only worried about getting your money and making you pay for premium I think the creators design this app to make you pay and most the other reviews agree."
"I hate the new update date >:(( I can't listen to songs in album order anymore, I can't pick what songs I want to play, I HATE SHUFFLE, and I can't stakin hit next more then 4 times so I can actually git to the song I want to play >>:( genuinely super upset, change it back to where it was a month ago PLEASE & THANK YOU !n!"
"Are you freaking kidding me Spotify, you suck so much!! I've now had to sit through 17 ads in a row. I mean seriously what the heck is your deal!! Sure you need to make your money, but are the millions that the subscriptions generate not enough?? The greed is beyond obvious to the point that this is straight disgusting!! Years ago I quit using Pandora because of the ads and now the time has come that I delete Spotify as well. Way to ruin the best music app in the play store👌👌"
Ui needs a do over as it's not natural to use. Feels unorganised. Please pay attention to the Spotify forums and action the top requested features instead of doing nothing but remove features and rearrange things. It often crashes and features such as the song title not updating when the songs changed from a previous session. Also sometimes it will just crash and the media controls will disappear. Samsung s10 and oppo find x3 pro. Great when it works but soundcloud ui is better & feature rich
Android app does not get the attention that iOS gets. The UI is worse and free teir users cannot select songs like how iOS can. Very limited on skips too and 2-3 ~1 minute ads play after every 2 songs.
"Every day a new bug. Phone goes to standy -> stops playing. Start a different Podcast -> UI still shows old one. Not even restarting the App helps. Also, navigation is not particuarly intuitive."
Have emailed issues to support well over 2 months ago and issues still exist even though app updates are weekly. Poor UI. Doesn't sync songs between devices. Doesn't remember the last song played when app is reopened. Won't update song info to car unit via bluetooth. Removed car options. Support aren't supportive. In hope of developers fixing these issues or provide an old version to use that works. It's like they want the app to fail... and it has!
"Careful. When you cancel premium and they confirm that your premium was cancelled, it's not really cancelled. They will secretly renew your premium and continue charging you. Also be aware that this app very intentionally makes it as hard as possible to move elsewhere. You have made huge playlists over time? You gonna move fully manual. Last but not least it always thinks I am offline though I am online both WiFi and data. It also deliberately hid log out button. Evil, and buggy. Stay out."
"I got this app to listen to music because YouTube has too many adds, I made playlists and my experience was great. But now I can't skip or play the songs I want in my own playlists, Spotify added songs I didn't want and now I can't skip them. I don't know what's going on and it's actually ruined my experience."
"Cant play song of my choice it keeps on rolling to its suggested stuff,cant go to previous track, skiping to next song button stopped working after 2,3 time usage; asking for premium option. WTH!!"
"The app in its current state is awful. EQ problems, keeps randomly turning on and playing through the speaker and the UI is poorly laid out."
"Dear Lord it's so slow... so laggy... so unresponsive sometimes, that I will rather open YouTube Music free and let it play with my screen on, than going through the trouble of opening Spotify. It's also far from an intuitive app. You can't just play a song and let the app select the next songs for you. You have to explicitly tell to play a radio, and finding what you want in offline mode is very confusing. Maybe they're out of devs, IDK."
"Has a great selection of podcasts but forces the use of their dumb software and lies to their users about using the browser. I'm tired of all the apps when it's just a website ffs. The ""open app"" button also doesn't work."
17/12/2021- Checked back to see if they fixed this app - it kicked me out after 2 weeks and I can no longer log back in and all I get is an error message. It is a shame because for two weeks it was quite good. Overall Spotify has a poor quality app that gives terrible experience and it often struggles to play music. I did have premium a while ago but I cancelled it because of the continuing disappointment of this app.
"Room for jmprovement. Needs a clear history option. Needs and option for comment, like and dislike songs and visible data for us. Podcast needs clearly number of plays and comments, design of whole interface is terribly old fashion and lazy. Needs lyrics like all Asian apps have years ago. Needs to have music news. Needs subfolders for playlists. Needs new user-managed algorythm. Thank u."
YouTube music is way better couldn't even choose to play a single song in this even basic features required premium and YouTube music is linked to YouTube so if you started listening to music on YouTube any plays of music or just a single music video you liked it even uses information from music you watched on YouTube to recommend music Spotify is also very difficult to use and confusing only way I managed to find a song I was looking for is a link under a YouTube video would say more char limit
I don't know what happened but the app is a buggy broken mess. The playback page gets stuck with a previous play - i.e I'm playing music and I can hear the music but it displays a podcast I was listening to. The pause and play buttons don't reflect the actual state of playback from the pull down notification curtain and my podcast keeps returning to the beginning. Absolute trash
"Why is the option for ""hide this song"" right above the option for ""add to playlist"" in a song's menu. I've hit the wrong button so many times, having to undo hiding a song because of it"
"What happend to car view, can someone explain? It's ridiculous to remove a somehow safety related feature without having something in exchange and even without telling upfront. It's a cruical feature. And I'm paying for it."
App is continuing to degrade in general performance. Can't even change the song due to the Player view being stuck on something I listebed to previously. Fix your app.
Always skips while in pocket due to lock screen having skip button since latest android install. Cannot find a way to remove the lock screen widget even by disabling all of the widgets as well as disabling notifications.
I can't access to fast forward or rewind options during song playing. There are NEXT and PREVIOUS buttons only. I can't play the song directly from the middle ...
"It SUXKS. Poorly designed and buggy. Downloaded for Rogan and there STILL is no way to turn off autoplay for podcasts. Fall asleep during a podcast, you wake up to find out that several podcasts have run. Why would a developer allow this? Unless they don't even use the app. At times the app shuts down midstream when using Wi-Fi or mobile. Shoddy, embarrassing & ugly app. Sucks, sucks, sucks."
What's up with wrapped? Before the update it only loaded music and a colour block. After the update it just flashes through super quickly. Please fix! I love the wrapped!
"Quite annoying, hard to discover music. If you have the free it's way too limited ( you can't skip songs( might as well be forced to)) and if you get the premium it's way worse than other premium apps for music streaming such as YouTube music, Google music, or iTunes, tidal etc. Can't even listen to music you select. It selects the music you listen you like it or not. This is Spotify I guess"
I pay for this app for 2 years now and with each and every update it's getting worse and worse... theirs no control of your play list... it will play and then jump to other music all the time that's not even in your play list... each update for some reason makes your play list stop or quit multiple times a day while listening... I can go on and on will all the faults of this app... thinking of quitting our payed membership soon! Also their are still ADS when you first load the app!!
Garbage app. I used it for an alarm and liked that assistant could call up music so I got the free trial. It needed me to press buttons to play music as soon as I gave them card info so that feature was out. I quickly noticed whatever amount of time they said was going to be uninterrupted after an advert was an overestiment and cant't be relied upon. First use after my card got charged they run 10 back to back commercials. Needless to say I won't give them more money in response to abuse.
I have premium and the app used to work great but now there must have been an update and it doesn't work at all. You can click on an album but the songs don't load (on my Samsung Galaxy J series). The app is completely useless as is. This needs a quick update to fix it or I don't foresee keeping premium for long.
"I do not recommend this app beacause its not even leting me to chose what songs I want,when I accidentally press the shuffle button it would not let chose songs,update this app to chose the songs that we want also let it swap by pushing the songs we want to hear l hope that you see this."
"This is genuinely the very worst music app you could install if you have to use the free version. It literally plays more adds than songs, in almost every update a new feature is added to make it harder and more inconvenient to discover new music. The only real way to listen to music without wanting to kill yourself is to have only one play list that you on repeat. Otherwise it it designed to literally bully users into buying the premium version."
"The app is nice, but it keeps crashing weirdly, the music constantly stops for no reason and when I try to unpause it it freezes up the entire device, even the button to turn off the device gets frozen"
"In the past, I would have rated this app high but for the past month, I can't even selected my playlist or search for new songs. I can't even play a different podcast. I have re-download the app multiple times and sent in multiple inquiries and nothing. I'm about to cancel my account."
"This app is so broke that it has to charge money for some of the most stupidest things. For example, background music, and especially playing what ever music you like and if u don't have preuimum, the only way that you can play your music is by shuffle play. So basily playing in random ordes. Such a disgrace"
"The app opens and no matter what I tap on, it freezes. I have 6GB of ram and my phone UI is just fine when this happens. What ever is going on is an app issue."
"The ads are so pathetic! They have increased the ads and what i hate it that the ads literally bully you and guilt you for not having spotify pReMiUm and its SO FRUSTRATING! the ads are not even related. I get ads about punjabi hits and stuff when i dont even listen to them! And that one very annoying APOLLO pharmacy ad , like why is it even in a music platform?! This is beyond pathetic , i listen to a 2 mins song and then get 2 mins long ad after it. Ppl are going to install mods now , grt."
The music randomly stops playing sometimes and it skips to the next song. It is very annoying. Also today I just found out that almost all my favourite songs disappeared? Please fix this issue Edit: Also it would be nice if you could add lyrics for ALL the songs. this app is a rip off. I cant play 2 songs without an ad interrupting me. this ruins the music listening experience👎
GARBAGE APP! Keeps deleting all my music on a daily basis forcing me to re-download it back onto my external SD card on the Samsung Galaxy. 110% unreliable. Keeps me constantly unpredictability not having offline access to my downloaded music when I need it the most. Countless ruined experiences and memories. Cheap fraudulent programming.
"The output when playing on a phone has a lesser quality than playing with a PC, I don't know what the problem is but it is ruining my listening experience. I can't tolerate such👎"
"Podcasts inaccessible for android users. As of 4/29/2020 trying to open a podcast, any podcast, leads to ""an error has occured"" other android users have run into this problem with no word from the devs. Will revise rating when issue is fixed Edit 12/9/2021 It worked for a while, now nothing plays at all, no error messages, its like the play button is vestigial. Restarted device and reinstalled app and it persists. Fix it"
"Awful app. Frequently simply fails to play songs or podcasts. UI is bad, navigating the app is awkward, and even paid subscribers still get blasted with advertisements in podcasts."
"The apps keep restarting whenever I want to view my Spotify Wrapped. It sucks, and so frustrating. Tried contacting the customer service, followed all the guidelines given, but still, the apps keep restarting whenever I want to view Spotify Wrapped. Spotify team, your newest update sucks. Please fix it"
Latest update removes quick controls from off my phone. They are continuing to remove decent features. Ads are also still popping up when I'm a paying member.... I can't give less then 1 star. The New update won't allow me to add items to my queue. I have a paid subscription and expect a working app. These extra features you added that bork thvapp aren't needed. Just don't force ads on podcasts for paid customers. Let us queue and focus on audio quality and no interuptions.
The update ruined the app. You can only get 10 seconds of a song to play. I now have to sit through ads that I never had to sit through before. It used to be awesome. Now it's just trash!
"Used to be good. Now they just keep adding 'suggested songs you might like' into all playlists. I have spent a couple of years adding to my lists and now they are ruined. I never minded the ads as that is how they get paid. I guess they just want you to sign up. Great if you can afford it. Will they still add 'suggestions' Looking at alternative sites now. Update, still s#$%e"
"Awful app. Keeps opening over and over again freezing my android 10. Cant get past first slide of spotify wrapped without it reopening or saying ""quickstep has stopped"" do not recommend."
"Hopefully a one star rating will get your attention, as there seems to be no way to contact anyone. The podcasts are playing so quickly, it almost sounds like the disclaimer at the end of an advertisement."
"my autoplay button is broken, I just want to play the songs that are in my playlist, i don't want recommend songs, I've tried toggling the autoplay button but it doesn't work, this is annoying to a whole new level, kindly fix this ASAP!!"
"Fix these please: 1) No dislike button, 2) Forced linking of queues on different devices. 3) Alexa skill doesn't have the explicit filter, so the app just refuses to play a song when there is an explicit and clean version."
"Making a playlist = easy. Playing a playlist = impossible. When trying to play a playlist, it just plays random songs instead. Why are you ignoring the minus/hide button? This app is so broken."
"I've loved Spotify over the years for it's ease of use and massive selection of music, but there is a lack of functionality that's ruined the app for me. I accidentally clicked play on a podcast recommended by Spotify and all the app does now is recommend podcasts I have zero interest in. After reading online, apparently the simple function of deleting song history isn't really high up on their devs' agenda; people have been wanting this since 2017! Come on, Spotify, try to get the basics right!"
"spotify wrapped is literally broken. everytime i try to play it - app crashes. also, new design is ugly. the previous one was way better. after the last update the app became more laggy."
Not all users have an iPhone. Making the UX useless on Android is quite annoying. All your online help is also suited to iPhones. I will ask to play an album and you will start to mix it. There is no way to turn off shuffle too even though you claim that it has been updated. Using Spotify on Android is annoying. Hell even. Would give it 0 stars if I could. Rubbish
"Genuinely an awful experience. When I tried to search for and listen to one song, the app shuffled it into a playlist with several other random songs instead of just playing the song I chose?? Very useless. The only reason I downloaded the app was to view my spotify wrapped, and every time I tried to click on that, the app crashed. I would not recommend this to anyone."
Terrible. Why am I paying for an app that stops every 30 seconds. I've done everything you FAQ suggests and still doesn't work. Can even Uninstall as there is just a disable button. Junk.
"Wrapped hasn't worked for years, artists underpaid often pauses songs for no reason, find myself using YouTube music most of the time now. Also the music downloading and off-line is just awful, whoever designed that is just, oh man, how can you do something so poorly, on YouTube music it detects you have no cell reception and prompts you to go off-line mode, in Spotify you have to go deepish into settings, also it never syncs downloads properly, you gotta do it yourself, YouTube just does it"
"I've rated this app before, back a year later to say nothing has changed. This app is still certified garbage, and they just don't listen. Constant updates to the UI, without a care in the world to making the app stable. Get locked out of this app monthly, and have to do a full re-install, which is beyond stupid. They have the money to fix this, but they don't. Also, if you're gonna change your UI so often, at least listen to what your users want. Just saying."
It worth the premium but with out premium it just a infestation of ads. You get more ads then songs. You may get blessed with a quick 30min free after watching guess what. Yup ad. After that 30min you'll be flooded with ads. Just call it adotify
"This is second year in a row as Spotify app doesn't show me my Spotify wrapped. It's genuinely upsetting. No idea what kind of bug is that but I just can't see anything. Nothing loads, and if something loads it just flashes before eyes with only solid colour behind which there should be titles, etc. No idea why it's happening for 2nd year in a row. I've never had this issue before."
"OMG.. fix your bugs, will you??? The music stops playing randomly, the music starts playing whenever the hell Spotify wants to. I don't have that play/stop button so when I do wanna listen to music by my choice, I can't really control the app..it plays and that's it. Seriously, it's been almost a month now, how much time do we have to suffer? Probably I will end my subscription for the premium account. I'm paying for nothing right now"
"The ads were already a bummer but quite understandable in ""premium"" era but the unskippable songs now is the worst thing to happen to Spotify ever. Practically impossible to like this ever again"
Great app for music. But still it don't deserve 5 stars if you don't buy premium. Like there's an ad waiting for your after every second of third song. Literally ruin the fun .
"You have ruined the free version! To make people go premium (as youtube does,ads!)so I'm now using my other app!a radio app from playstore. Vradio....while it doesn't let me make a playlist,I can choose from 4500 Stations and just find ad free ones.even after making a playlist neither Spotify/ deezer let you just listen to it! Ruin it with ads or suggesting a song and you never hear the full list. Follow day you get repeated songs! Bye!"
"Spotify continues to change the app in ways that worsen user experience, if it continues on this path I'm going to unsubscribe, Seriously stop changing the app, you made the third tab completely unusable at this point, now default shuffle is gone and now your killing car view which was actually useful."
"developer team seem to be led by clueless managers and execs. things could be SO much better but they seem to be using a strange strategy of not having one and just continuing to ruin things. the app overall is very glitchy, offline mode is slow as anything and often things don't load. hit and a miss."
Car mode removed without suitable and active replacement in place is a horrible decision. I used it always and felt safer driving. If liked heart no longer works then things are even worse. Smarten up Spotify.
The amount of ads which are being going on recently are wayyy too more. Some people don't wanna buy your membership. And you have to respect their decision too. U can't keep playing 4 5 min ads between the songs it ruins everything. Just pissed so I deleted the app
"The app with full time ads , how an ad service can totally destroy a good app , this is the example ... Free service needs ad support , i know and i accept it , but too much ads ruin all experience ... Now it is worse music streaming service in the world ... YouTube music now gain more positivity , because their free account doesn't have much ads ...few ads are acceptable ..."
Really good on the PC Web Version but don't bother with the app. I don't know if my phone was the problem but it just DOESNT work for me. It keeps shuffling my playlist even though shuffle isn't on and I can't turn it off. I can't select what song the playlist starts on and I can't go back to the previous song with the skip button. I also can't seem to rewind or fast forward a song and just have to wait for it to end or skip until I get to it again.
"Cancelling your sub is the most difficult thing to do. Also if you change any of your information like your email, why the hell do you still require the old email for log in??? If it's updated there's a reason for it!!"
"Just the idea of not being able to skip songs freely or put your playlist on loop is a heavy no. And the ad after almost every 2 songs, even double ads at times, big nope from me. Persuading me to spend money on premium is just making me not buy it at all with that spam. Designed for people that pay and the rest can go f themselves cause the app has barely anything if ur a f2u Type."
"whoever designed this app did an awful job. with numerous ads and unecessary add ons without premium, youre much better off with a different music streaming service. it plays random songs and literally limits the amount of skips you have. the creators are money hungry. and you dont get to enjoy doing something as simple as listening to music unless youre paying the app. dont waste your money or time."
I hate how they add stuff to your playlists. I have a couple playlists that are just albums and it ruins that by adding a bunch of songs that end up not even being by the same artist. I like the computer version better and find the mobile version disappointing.
Every update seems to degrade the user experience. Up next now throws random music at you rather than playing the selected playlist. Cannot turn of this forced shuffle. Unsubscribed.
"Loved it. But then it changed. No more android carplay feature. No equaliser.even the buttons are so small now it's harder to use. Even on Bluetooth headphones or speakers the screen doesn't stay on ""now playing"" mode anymore and goes into sleep mode. After 3 years of premium I now hate it. Il be deleting sadly."
"On my Pixel 4a (5g) when I turn off the screen the music stutters and turns off. This requires me to keep the screen on to listen to music, which is not useful."
"No shuffle play button on albums anymore, which means that I constantly need to toggle and untoggle shuffle mode based on what I'm listening to. It used to be perfect but apparently although I'm the one paying the subscription Adele gets to decide how I should listen to music. Wasn't gonna listen to your album anyway, you stupid woman."
Tries to download my entire library every time I connect online. It constantly crashes. The UI is getting worse and worse with every update.
"Add a ""remove from playlist"" button from the menu of the actual song playing, I hate having to go find it in the Playlist and remove it from there. Just add the button!"
"Firstly this is poorly designed for mobile, secondly you can't even play a song that you directly searched up using the app you have to put it into a playlist and play that playlist specifically. It lacks 90% of the features which you get on Spotify free on PC / Chromebook. I wish I've could have given this peice of garbage less than 1 star. Don't bother spending cash on Spotify premium, besides the removal of advertisements everything else is the same. Grandma's old record-player works better."
"My ""made for you"" section has become broken since this morning, it now only shows my blends, but I hadn't updated it since this morning so not sure why it's stopped showing all the mixes? Please fix ASAP it was great before, why do you keep ruining the app with pointless updates?!"
"This app is exceedingly intriguing as it gives you copious opportunity to search and play any song and listen to any artiste you love his or her songs much dearly, but I must certify that the only infallibility it has that gets on my nerves, sometimes, is that good network connection is the only condition you would have if actually you want to play any song. Without it, playing songs will be frivolous and unavailable."
"So far Spotify has been great 👍, either I'm not doing something right, not sure but like to read some history about the bands how they got started, I know quite a bit, just incase there's some history I missed keep it up Spotify until next time 😉"
"Spotify When I first Downloaded it in 2019, It became my favourite music Listening app. But Now I Get 2 ads of 30 sec each after every 2 songs, and sometimes 3 ads. And It's too much can't you give ads after 3 or 4 songs, it's too bad. I use it just on mobile and for PC I've prime music and I don't want to take premium just for mobile. Please solve it or I'll quit Spotify."
"Best music streamer you could possible install.It's able to drop right in to whatever ecosystem that you interact with.Truly feels like some genie Technician is coding the app directly around your needs and wants as you go along.Up until you have to fall off the premium membership.. then you very quickly reminded of what being a spotify peasant is all about.completely different experience between the premium membership and the ""would u rather eat today or jam sum uninterrupted music"" membership"
Developers are crazy to remove the sort playlist feature. They also got rid of the remove from playlist button from the currently playing menu. Why are they actively making the app worse? Fix these and I will give 5 stars
"trying to connect through spotify to my headphones. it shows connected but it wont make any sound. without headphones playing it still has issues. glitches auto turns track, buffers. there new update ruined then till they fix it. once fix ill update my post"
"Confusing and not functional. I cannot go to a specific song in my liked playlists. The button in the bottom right corner doesn't do anything and when I skip next, it takes me to a random song."
"1. Give me a way to hide all podcasts. Massive waste of home page space I'll never use; it's basically just advertising in an app i pay for. 2. Daily Mixes are no longer in a predictable location. You need to scroll through your entire home page both ways to find them because the ""recently played"" widget is exclusive. Rookie design mistake. I wonder if they're even trying at this point."
When I start suing that app that was amazing bt after 2 to 3 updates it starts problem like if I play a song 🎵 that doesn't play bt relates songs play.....plzzz fix it otherwise I stop using it and delete it..... Ganna app is much better than this.....
"Why is my liked playlist playing songs that I've not liked before...seriously? Also why can't I skip a song I don't want to listen to? Lastly why is there no previous button? On a light note, the playlist preview is time wasting and unnecessary"
The app just quit. It says all my play lists are deleted. I reinstalled it and now it says my password is incorrect even though the same password works on my computer.
Basically non functional UI. Worse with every update. How about just let me search for stuff and play it in a simple way like old days? How about having a Podcast player that actually works? How about having ANYTHING intuitive about the interface? I would not use this if they didn't have basically a monopoly on streaming library. Garbage app.
"I pay for premium because I'm a clown, but this app, both desktop and mobile, are unbearable to use. Forget user friendliness, the clunkiness (horrible UI, freezing and other glitches) is borderline hostile. Now I can't even log in because the app says I'm offline even though I'm connected to wi-fi. Insane that we've all gotten forced into streaming music instead of owning it by companies as incompetent as this one."
Too many advertisements and the ui is trash for podcasts. I have prime music which works okayish (it has 0 advertisements) the only reason I still have this app installed on my phone is that it has exclusive rights to the full version of jre (Joe rogan podcast) which I happen to listen at times other than that this app is trash in my opinion.
"The PC version is nice. But for phone, there are lots of bugs and the UI is not really friendly."
I used Spotify for a couple of years to listen to podcasts. I love the content but the app sucks. 1. It constantly crashes. 2. Requires an Internet connection to play files I have already downloaded to my phone. 3. The fast forward and reverse buttons are greyed out on my phone's lock screen so cannot be used. I switched to the Pocket Casts app a few days ago and it is so much better. It's stable and its functionality actually works.
"New update makes me quitting this app. For some reason now whenever I searched for a song it gave me the whole playlist. I get that this app is like forcing you to go premium but this is just disgusting. I pay the app from time to time and sometimes I just use the free version with ads because of financial reason on some month. I just want to enjoy one song instead of the whole playlist. You guys want to give more ads go ahead, but not like this."
"When watched a video ad, it grants you no ads for 30 MINUTES, which is not given, i tested it. Including the the songs you skip, even they dont complete whole 30 mins, I know the consumer rights, and I can file a lawsuit against this, but i won't, yet. Please fix this. What I want to be fixed is that I should be given WHOLE 30 MINUTES OF UNINTERRUPTED LISENINGS.Dont remove it btw."
"I already have a Spotify premium subscription, but the app will not stop trying to upselle to duo/family plans. the screen it uses to advertise these plans to me is broken and freezes the all, and the only way to use the app again is to force quit it. I'm already giving you my money stop with this broken awful upselling behaviour"
"Screw this app. The one 'decent' music app Samsung has can't even properly play music right. Not only that, but I get 7 ADS PER SONG because I don't want to pay 10 DOLLARS A MONTH. This used to be a decent app, but you had to ruin it by being cheap."
This is borderline unusable. The Spotify corporation is so delusional. Seriously. Why doesn't it let you choose a song from an album? Why can you only skip 6 songs per hour? Why does this feel like a tool to view ads? The devs must have done no beta testing before release. The user experience is just awful. Please don't install this.
Seriously some ads are fine but a 1 minute ad after every other song ruins it for me. The passive aggressive ads are enough to drive away the audience.
"Edit. 11/13 21 App is still hot garbage. Nothing fixed yet I have premium because of exclusive content, or i would use something else. The android app is the most unstable glitchy app I have ever used. It plays ads and then restarts the podcast so you have to stop and hunt for where you left off. If you start listening before where the ad is injected, you get to start over after the unskippable ad over and over. The app will crash and require multiple restarts to get it to play in your vehicle."
Worked perfect 5 months ago. Now all it does is pause every 8 seconds which is super annoying with airpods. I have to click my lock button to make it keep going every time it pauses. All my settings are correct ive tried everything 20 times. I have fast internet and all of the above. App keeps getting worse. please just go back to the 5 months ago beta. Id much rather have the app glitch per 2 or 3 hours than every 5 to 30 seconds. sheeshhh annoyinggggg
"There is no car mode anymore, i have a custom android head unit in my car, since the new update, all the buttons are tiny in landscape which is not very safe when driving. Instead this ""car thing"" has appeared. I dont particularly want car thing, as my head unit is pefectly capable of playing music. Please increase the size of the buttons in landscape mode."
I can't download any new albums or playlists. I can't listen to some podcasts that I follow. I can't follow any new podcasts. A message pops up asking me if I want to do the family subscription and won't let me dismiss the message. The like button doesn't work. Fix your app because it's broken.
"Not experiencing any bugs or anything anymore, but i miss the thumbs up and thumbs down on radio stations. I only ever used the radio as a more customizable way to discover new music, not as another pre-built playlist."
"Essentially the worst of the worst. Constant updates and bug ""fixes"" that do nothing to improve the quality of the application, an ever increasing monthly fee for what should be basic features, constant need to connect to servers in order to access locally stored content and playback that will quite simply stop working randomly. Spotify, my experience as your customer has been nothing but arduous at its absolute best."
"Update ruined my listening, my husband and I pay for Spotify and I have a login under 'his' main account. Since the last up date I can no longer flick through my music play lists or 'go back' to previous songs and I have ads."
"They changed or well REMOVED one of their best features. The car view. It's no longer available with the current version. The care view is extremely helpful as you got bigger buttons to skip, play and pause songs. Not every car has a Bluetooth player built-in etc. This feature needs to be added back."
"Update: the app still takes forever to load my podcasts (whether I'm on a good internet source or not). Wish there was another option Lately this app has been so glitchy and crashes anytime I click on the menu button to either add a sleep timer or add a song to a Playlist. Also, whenever I'm on offline mode it will tries to connect to the internet 3rd Update: drop down menu still glitches in offline mode. The app still has a problem loading dwnloaded songs in offline mode when in poor signal."
useless waste of an app. it was fine at first but it was completely ruined. want to listen to this specific song? Nope have to use premium. Want to listen to this one song on loop and just that song? No they turned it into a playlist and you cant do anything about it. Want to make a playlist? THEY ADD SONGS YOU DONT EVEN LIKE TO IT AND YOU CANT GET RID OF THEM MY GOD AND I THOUGHT YOUTUBE MUSIC WAS BAD all i wanted was an app to listen to music in the background but thats to much to ask for
Too many ads even with premium. Issues downloading podcasts. Podcasts often reset to the beginning after ads. Too buggy and poor user experience for a company like Spotify.
This app has literally become pathetic. I must say that I began with a good experience a few years ago but today I feel that this app has become so pathetic that I don't even feel like using it. The biggest problem:ADs. This app has more ads playing than songs. For every song I have to listen to 3 ads stretching 30 seconds each. What is the point of using a song listening app when all it play is ads and not songs.YOU'RE THE WORST APP I'VE EVER USED. THANK YOU FOR RUINING MY DAY! DISAPPOINTED!
Stuttering playback The music or podcast keeps pausing and playing back. It doesn't matter if it's cellular network or WiFi. Even if I download songs or podcasts still happens. Really really annoying and it ruins completely the experience. I'm not sure if it's a problem with my phone or a bug with the app.
"Spotify is so rubbish right now, if I don't have Internet then deleting songs from my playlist doesn't actually delete them!! I wish we could swipe right on a song to add to the queue like on iPhone! And the queue hardly works either! Not only is it not the next song played if I queue it, but god forbid you try to queue multiple things at once. Sort it out!!! Finally the previous song button now only works 50% of the time!? So If I wanna check the song that just played then good luck 😠"
This app works fine until your subscription runs out. My problem is it requires my street to be entered into it. Spotify says that my street does not exist. So logically thinking I input every road near me. Apparently this entire place doesn't exist. I'm not off the grid either. I'm in the middle of a city.
You ruined the entire app with auto add. All i want to is hear my favorite song over and over. Not listening to random songs that doesnt even fit my genre. All because you wanted more money.
"Absolutely awful why would I say this Well before this update I was able to listen to my playlists I made with some adds but was able to skip and play parts of songs I wanted Now I only get 30 seconds of it and the only usefull thing for this app is to use it for my Games console when playing online gaming But I still get constant adds especially them trying to promote thair own services ""if you get premium you can listen on your phone "" At least youtube gives you a skip add button 👎"
I do not want to share my personal information like gender or birthdate but it is required to install the app! (GDPR requirements not met). I suppose one can listen or like a song independently on his/her age or gender. Can't select the song I want and the usability is really sad.
"Spotify was all good and convenient until this latest update ruin my music experience. For months I enjoyed Spotify for numerous songs to pick, guilt-free(legal) listening, and lyrics availableThis app WAS excellent until the recent changes, you're not allowed to exceed 6 times of skipping songs, the layout/ format of the list of songs of the artists are messy can't play them anymore, unless you shuffle! As if you're required to listen to songs you don't want to hear."
"My app is super bugged,every 5 mins it pauses without me touching the pause button,when I listen to a song example:You Never Know,It's bugged and I see that I'm listening to another song,example:LALISA Pls resolve this bug... for now it's only 1 ☆"
"Just to make us buy premium they have started putting way, way too many ads in between songs. Previously also there were ads but now it's just ads. Completely ruined the whole experience."
"Have been spotify user for quite some time. In last few months it is constantly pausing whenever the phone screensaver locks. It so annoying, specialy while I am running."
"Making a point here. I like Spotify, but it's bloody cheeky with limiting the utility of the free version. Ads- totally fair. Basic function being torn asunder- not quite."
Honestly this app is horrible cause random songs that were never part of the album will just start playing and idk why it's very annoying when I'm enjoying an album when some random song that's never in the album just starts playing and my mood is ruined
"using this to listen to exclusive podcasts, its terrible, impossible to reorder the podcasts in a playlist. very non intuitive to use."
"The homepage changes layout like every 18 hours, gets rid of recently played and puts in a playlist that its been trying to shove down my throat for weeks. The quick access stuff at the top of the page hardly ever changes and is usually things I haven't listened to in months. Keeps pushing podcasts that are nothing near my interests as well. All I want is my playlists and recently played to be accessible quickly. Switching to apple music."
"1. Stop breaking BMW (and other car) interaction, sometimes the app works through the designated Spotify BMW app, other times it's not available as Spotify has updated the Android app 2. Upgrade the sound quality to be on a par with Tidal and Amazon HD. Edit: back to 1 star as they broke the BMW connection with the latest update Edit2: reply from Spotify was to go on their community but there are 100s of posts already and the reply from Spotify is that it isn't a priority. Very very poor"
App crashes almost every time I try to use it. Some songs just stay mute no matter what. The content is great but technical issues ruin it for me completely. Seeing how there are numerous reviews reporting the same issue I'm surprised that nothing's being done about it.
"Numerous UI issues. Ads cause some podcasts to restart from the beginning. Customer support is terrible even for premium subscribers. What prompted me to finally write this review was opening the app and seeing a giant pop-up of propaganda regarding midterm elections. No, I don't need your advice on voting, Spotify."
"I had a Spotify premium account for months but a month ago or so, I decided to cancel it for some personal reasons. Yesterday I tried to play a song and as soon as I hit the play button I was charged the premium membership with no warning. Sounds kind of illegal to me. I'm really disappointed, but I guess you can't trust companies."
First off Y'all keep adding to my playlists...and I hate not being able to pick the exact song I wanna listen too...y'all are pretty much never getting a 2 star from me Intell y'all fix these problems... edit new annoying thing is y'all keep offering free premiums then ask for a credit card???? What the heck if it's free then why do y'all need a credit card for something that's free if y'all gonna make it require a card then you might as well put a price on it instead of calling it free
"I used to like this app earlier. However, now it is just frustrating because it interrupts too much with its ads that it ruins the whole music listening experience. It forces continuously to buy premium and many times the ads are so long that it ruins my mood to listen before even listening to any song."
"this sucks. the front page has been over-simplified. instead of a grid of recent listens and suggestions, there are now ONLY recommendations in overbearing rectangles. Spotify is placing more weight into what they think you should listen to. keep the recommendations in a separate optional tab, I know what I want!!! other reviewers have mentioned other seemingly base requirements (durations of tracks, better playlist management), but this is so far gone it's not even worth it."
"I really liked the app before the most recent update (10/23/21) but now the UI is just messy. Spotify also had a great algorithm for my ""Daily mix"" there used to be like 3/4 of these. Now there is only one. All the icons are bigger but have less content. Fix this"
"This app needs work. The amount of ads are extreme, the app keeps not working correctly. The UI needs improvement, its hard to find the songs you want. The limited skips? Really? Thats a sleasy move, a premium option is fine but don't appreciate pressure tactics. Besides im not gna pay for a faulty app. Easier to keep a playlist on my phone"
"I don't know what the genuises at Spotify have done to this app but I've had nothing but problems since the update in Sept 2021. Spinning green circle of death when searching, get an artist up and click on the name- get the green circle and nothing happens, select a song and can't play on the phone but I can play on a connected device - or if it plays on the phone, no sound, my playlists vanished from the library menu and popped up against my user profile instead. I pay family sub for this???"
"Spotify sucks in terms of compatibility with devices like Google Home. When I try to play a song on my Home through Spotify on mobile, it just refuses to play the next song after the completion of the current song, even after clicking on the next song button. All it does after is play ads occasionally but will not skip to the next song unless you manually choose a song, which then again just plays once after which it refuses to go the next song."
"This app is appallingly glitchy. Podcasts constantly pause and play until you've shut the app down 4 times. It will delete my usage and start playing a random show, making me lose my spot in my podcasts. The app is the most user-unfriendly app I've ever experienced. I cant overstate how disappointing it is to have another multi-million dollar company that could care a less about their customers and user experience."
"This new layout on the homepage sucks. Terrible UI change, reduced the amount of actual useable info on the page. Change it back. Everything else works fine"
"Continually destroying the end user experience one update at a time. Thank you for making my home screen useless, after already butchering library functionality and playlist optiobs"
It was amazing at first but the update ruined everything when I try to play a song it only plays the chorus not the full song do you need premium?! If so then it's bad please fix this problem I'm tired of it
"Who OK'd this UI? It is so bad, it seems like it was made by a psychopathic alien who knows we will hate it and wanted to make it bad. Can't select more than one song to add then to a playlist? Are you actually insane? Why is my front page not my library. Why can't I set a front page. Why don't you have a separate app for podcasts since you obviously don't value them to have a good enough interface for it. I can't even believe it after all this time using this app, and the ads- just awful awful"
"The only app in the world where you need to be online to add a song to queue. If you have a slow connection, you CAN'T open the single song popup menu by holding. They were also dumb enough to add ads to podcasts FOR PREMIUM USERS, since 2 years now. I stated to boycott the podcasts feature. I get them on YT anyway. I'm a premium user for years. I remember that the mobile app was trash right from the start with continuos crashes. I think I'm going to quit spotify. There are alternatives, bye."
So many ads youtube has less ads than this app. Even if you watch many different ads to be able to listen to music with no disturbances it doesn't work. Another problem is it wont quit adding stupid songs that I have never heard of before in my playlist that I made. Don't recommend too many ads and adds stupid songs.
"It's fun at first, I've been paying premium account, for 8 months already yet this past days the Lyrics option and button didn't appear in my spotify, same with my Spotify in laptop the microphone icon is gone. hope you'll fix it and I'll return my 5 star rate."
"Without spotify premium, it's sucks period, you can only skip like 7 songs ever 6 hours and it plays songs that aren't on my playlist like for real I didn't make a Playlist add a bunch of songs just to listen to random songs that ruin the mood."
"Ok i gave it a one star because of them stop trying to hide that they want you to buy Premium, they made it so you cant play the song the way you want to play it, you cant loop your song, ads well play inbetween every song telling you to buy Premium and every time you get in the app there will be without fail a ad about Premuim, and i get that want money but they have took it a bit too far"
Library and especially playlists ruined. Hideous disorganization. It throws all my albums and playlists together as default and the alphabetical function doesn't apply to playlists within folders. I have a folder with 126 lists that NEEDS alphabetical order otherwise it's disorganized & can't be navigated. I've spent years systematically cultivating those playlist covers to fit this order. My years of work is obliterated. Why take away a perfectly good library format and make it LESS navigable?
"On Android it's a nightmare to use this app. Controls are unintuitive. Very hard to stop it once playing, keeps playing by itself even after hitting pause. Keeps running till I kill Bluetooth or net connection altogether. Not easy to manage playlist songs, order etc on the app."
You idiots have ruined the Joe Rogan podcast with your moronic ads. I don't care about the ads at the beginning or even having to listen to a set of them at the intro. But you idiots have these ads pop up several times during the podcast AND the best part is it usually doesn't save my spot into the podcast and starts it over. When that happens I get to have all the same stupid ads shoved down my throat again. This has been this way for many months. Premium price for trash app.
"It doesn't let me play this song I want to play. it acts like everything I look up is a playlist when in reality I want a specific song, and then the ability to replay that song. I don't know how to backout of a song that is currently playing so I can play a different one because whenever I hit to play button on a different song it just hurry activates this song I wanted to back out of. It would be a good app if it wasn't so confusing to navigate and use"
"Useless if you're not connected to the internet. What's the point of downloading content if you can't access it. What's the point of downloading only audio content if when played it goes to video and ruins your data plan ... Slow to load anything, very slow. Useless app, really annoyed with it!"
"In all honesty, the app is great but the developers and features are garbage. I don't listen to music constantly and would like there to be a feature where I can stop spotify from turning on and playing music the moment it connects to a Bluetooth device. As one developer to another, such poor design. Devs get a solid 1/10 rating."
Can no longer choose an album and see the list of songs from that album. Can only choose a random mix of songs from said album. Awful UI changes.
"Out of the blue the app suddenly stopped being able to connect to the internet. All my other apps can connect fine, but Spotify tells me I have no internet connection. The app is up to date and I've double checked my settings. This may be a one-off error but it's lasted weeks now. I'm largely managing without the connection because I have a lot of songs downloaded already, but stupidly the app requires me to connect to the internet to queue my songs! Make queuing songs an internal function!"
"I have been paying for the premium account every month since the last year. Only this month when RBI guidelines updated, Spotify doesn't bother to update themselves in the e-mandate column, because of which my monthly payment stopped and I lost my subscription. Now if I want to subscribe again, I have to pay new increased amount just like those buying premium for the first time. Why trouble people who already use premium? Just to make more money? You people suck!"
Latest update broke displaying song info when in car. When changing track song info stays previous track. When use pause and next \ previous buttons track info might change. Using Motorola's edge 20 phone.
"Atrocious UI. Hostile navigation that makes you work for the simplest things like switching to an artist page from a song or album. No ability to group playlists or add entire albums or playlists to other playlists. Managing the song queue is a nightmare, it's extremely hard to avoid playing a song while trying to tap the microscopic ellipses that contains all the options pertaining to said song. Impossible to sort music by songs or genres. This app was made to frustrate people."
The option to play local files off your desktop is no longer available in settings. The button to turn it on is straight up gone. bring it back.
"This is such a terrible app. Constantly crashes, un-downloads songs that I have definitely downloaded, they change the UI with every update making it worse and harder to use each time. Last time they actually REMOVED the ability to sort my music library by artist!What is wrong with you devs???"
"Edit: since may 2021 this app has been terrible. New UI is terrible. Trying to blur the lines between music and podcasts has negatively impacted navigation in the app. Was pretty perfect until this May 2021 update and now it is a labour to find what I want to listen to. Fix it, reverse it, I'll update my review."
"Give us 1 ad on the free membership not 5 its ridiculous your gonna lose alot of customers, add more ways of payment not everyone can pay now make a pay later option like after pay or something. pick up your game or your gonna lose alot of customers, also add more skips 6 skips really isnt enough if you have like 100 songs add like 10-15 at least. Please consider my evaluations Can you add a previous button on the free membership cause you might accidentally skip a song"
Continuing to have issues. Constantly stops after 2 or 3 songs. Is not showing the current song playing. Got worse just after the update on the 10th October 2021
"So many issues! I have to constantly uninstall and reinstall the app, clear the cache, log in and out. Screen keeps freezing and won't show the currently playing song, won't reliably connect to Bluetooth speakers or my car. This app is quickly becoming more of a hassle than it is worth!!"
I don't know what they did but now I'm getting random songs in my liked songs que. I can handle an ad after every song but playing random bologna in my liked songs que is too far. Just play the music I like and stop ruining your app
Spotify keeps on removing the title and album art without telling the specific reason and just says it violates their guidelines. Even simplified the title and doodled whatever at Paint for my album art and yet they took it down within a minute. Uninstalling.
"I hate the shuffle option, I've been using this app for the longest time, and this just ruined the app, I cant individually listen to my favorite song, I can only preview, and the only way to listen to the song is to shuffle through all my songs and find it, excluding the constant ads"
"The app is being ruined by inserting ads into podcasts even for Premium users. I pay the subscription to avoid ads and listen to the podcasts I like, and I am really not interested in some new Spotify exclusive podcasts by people I've never heard of. The most annoying thing is when I am listening to a podcast while falling asleep and an ad just starts blasting really loud. I wouldn't mind paying a bit more for premium to avoid all ads, but having to listen to ads is unacceptable!"
"Poorly designed app, difficult to navigate through local downloaded library. Video playing interface is poor. Long term UX and UI issues within the app will frustrate people enough to drive them to alternatives. Even the wheelhouse of this app; online radio and suggestions, is quite poor. There is no attempt to introduce consumers to new or less well known artists; only a constant funneling to a small number of highly successful international artists it determines are your preferences."
Keeps quitting. This week I noticed the app just shuts down and quits while playing a song. Had hoped it was a one time thing but has been going on for days now... I have a paid account but not getting the level of service I'd expect with the app just shutting down randomly.
"FIX YOUR DAMN APP! It keeps freezing, I can't stop music, can't close the app, can't remove notification, the play button is glitching."
As usual Spotify is continuing to let us down. It's worse when you pay for subscription. What's the point of paying when the app just shuts down and doesn't cooperate. BUYER BEWARE! They don't care about their customers. I've emailed then and they were no help.
"Premium is too expensive. And non-premuium is rubbish. Like 3 adds ever 4 songs or something, you can't choose the song you wanna listen to, and u only have 6 skips every 30 minutes all because I don't wanna pay £10 a month."
"I like the wide amount of the music but these adds are way out of control and they are the most triggering thing in my day. I was promised 30mins of no adds and then 10 mins later I get 2 adds. It's not just this after like 3 songs a get 3 adds, 30 seconds, and then some 10 second add telling me a lie about my 30 min add free listening it's redicilous. Quick edit: I've just had to suffer 5 adds just to start a playlist and that wasn't even an offer for 30 mins add free. Update: Just got 11 ads"
"latest update made it pointless. they added weird songs to my playlist, and I can't pick a specific song to listen, they just force me to listen to ""similar"" songs that sound nothing like what I love. will keep it installed for a week and see if they decide to make their app usable. I'd rate it -1 out if 5 because not only it doesn't play my songs, it plays smth I don't like instead. bravo, exerience completely ruined. edit: nevermind, 6 skips per hour? into the trash it goes."
"App was confusing to use. I was trying to repeat my favorite song, and I couldnt find the repeat button and all songs was in shuffle which I didnt want. The ads were annoying and was barely bearable."
"Most glitch and crash prone premium service I pay for. Treats music artists terribly and has a joke of a ui. I pay for them only in the short term, I am working on moving all of my music to other platforms. Spotify is a terrible company and a terrible app. If it didn't have a borderline monopoly on music streaming I would expect competition to shred them."
"The app is for it's purpose but can't use is it properly, since the song being played automatically stops playing although it'll be in playing mode. This happens after every 2nd song. Then i bought premium account for one month, still same issue. 4G data is on and even cruising on a highway it happens also while connected to wifi at home. Pathetic experience...."
"Horrible for podcasts, this constantly resets Joe Rogan podcasts to start over from the beginning when I pause or shut the app. Beyond annoying it ruins the experience."
I pay for the premium and while I enjoy the music with no ads I would love to have an option to move songs a hell of a lot quicker. The song movement is too slow please make it quicker. The app also sometimes refuses to connect to my Xbox Series S which is annoying.
"This app crashes constantly. There is no easy way to select a single song to play. It always plays a playlist of ""like"" music. If you choose an album it always plays in shuffle mode ruining the original intent of the artists."
"They keep making the ui worse while the stability remains terrible. I'll be browsing ""More like x Artist"" sections only for them to disappear right in front of my eyes before I can see every suggestion. The Library page is a mess and doesn't take advantage of Androids hardware Back button anymore."
Quit suggesting stupid erotic podcasts on my home page! I use this for music. Not podcasts. Let alone that kind of stuff. Switching to YouTube music if this isn't fixed....pretty annoying and disgusting.
Spotify consistently makes their product unusable with terrible updates to their user interface. Utterly ridiculous design choices kill the app every time I accidentally update it. Need to roll back to December of 2019 again to finally get a functional app.
"1. Shuffle plays a very small fraction of songs from a playlist. Eg out of 100 songs it always only plays the same 10 or so. 2. Unable to over ride the forementioned issue by simply clicking play on the song I want to hear in a playlist or even the recommended songs list.Please edit the app so the user has greater control eg option of a ""play "" button as well as the shuffle. It would be incredible to be able to create temporary ""queues"" like on youtube/ facebook."
App is fine but add a feature where you can drag to select songs that play first or play songs multiple times and then move to a new song without human intervention The fact that the app can't handle bluetooth buttons on a bluetooth buttons disappointed me ...I prolly won't use the app until they add a function where you can assign keys on your bluetooth headphone keys to change songs and other types of stuff which currents just makes the song play from the start
"Broken in regards to Bluetooth on the pixel 5a. Constantly stutters and drops when the screen is off. Problem doesn't exist on any other music player I use on this phone so I'm looking at you, Spotify. Spotify support says they won't fix the issue and blames Google. Will not be continuing subscription."
Horrible experience for podcasts. Unfortunately Spotify is grabbing up all my favorite shows and I have to use it if I want to listen. The UI needs a lot of work to be conducive to podcast listening. Edit: giving 1 star now instead of two. App constantly stops episodes of podcasts or randomly skips ahead to the next episode.
The new ads are insulting ..they are mocking my passion for music and have cheap personalities ..I feel bullied to pay for Spotify premium...I am okay with normal ads but these just ruin my experience ..and it feels like that's the intention behind the direction of these advertisements ...my disappointment is immeasurable and my music time is ruined! I'm sorry for this review but I wasn't given the opportunity to tell anything good
"Very good app , it has very creative and unique ads but some songs in between ruin the mood !!! Pls do something of that and change your name from Spotify: Music to Spotify:Advertisement!! 👍"
Spotify was best ... But after they increase number of ads. This app has become irritating it 2 -3 ads come after each song which distrubs very much ... If you want ad free music please switch to other music apps such as Gaana .. because Spotify has become pay to listen app ... I am requesting to the developer please fix this .. or your app will definitely be ruiend like Gaana they were also good but they did same thing like you and now there are over...this will aslo happen to your app as well
Latest update has absolutely ruined Spotify Connect synchronisation. Incredibly frustrating when one is paying for this service on a monthly basis. Please fix. Edit: Still paying for a service that has become so poor. When will these issues be fixed?
"Issues with playing music. I press play, get blasted with 2 loud adverts, then Kanye West plays instead of what I asked for. Frustrating and buggy. Unfit for purpose. At least play tracks in a similar genre to what I wanted. EDIT: Just found out this is because the free version only allows shuffle play; I'm trying to play a single. Seriously, Spotify? If this is the groundbreaking planning and development from a leading streaming service then I'm sticking with CDs. Gormlessly stupid design."
"Really really clunky UI. Slightly more convenient than listening to music on YouTube with an adblocker, but for podcasts I recommend podcast addict. It lets you skip commercials."
Way too many ads! Like every 5 mins there is a triple ad break. It's honestly ridiculous! I was going to subscribe to the premium plan after the constant annoying pushes because I love the UI and the discovery mixes but after I realised they lie to you about 30 min uninterrupted music for a 30 sec video ad I changed my mind and got Youtube premium.
"First time downloading and there's something wrong with the app. Whenever I try to play songs, it stops at 10 seconds and can't be unpaused. You can't press the pause/unpause button. And hours later I tried again but when I tried to play a song it just stayed on 0 second and wouldn't move. Please fix this."
Just wanted to say you've completely ruined this app. You cant listen to the songs you want because it just makes you listen to some other song that you didn't request. It adds random stuff to you playlist which you didn't put on yourself and you cant remove it and you cant skip those songs because you have limited skips. It works perfect on pc but what have you done to the mobile version.
"If you're willing to cough up the rather ridiculous premium fee, then you've got yourself a pretty amazing app. However, free users, be ready for basic music features to be locked behind a paywall. You want to skip a couple of songs? NOPE You want to play that ONE song? HAH, not a chance. Expect a lot of shuffling! I hate Spotify. I'd rather just buy the individual tracks. Premium shouldn't be required just to listen to your playlist in the order you added them."
"*** Went with Tidal, and it's amazing ** Edit: keeps crashing over and over. This is the last time I pay for spotify. It's not about the quality of the songs or the size of the follio of songs, but the ease of use of the main page, the possibility to customize and the overall user experience. Spotify keeps promoting to me joe regan show podcast and I can't remove that. Their main page can't be customized and their auto selection is simply limited and always promoting the same album."
"The commercials restart my podcast to the begging everytime they pop up, most annoying thing is that the commercial will happen again at the same time stamp and restart all over again. This is a paid subscription you greedy people. Stop ruining something I pay for with your greedy cash grabs"
"Please do better, honestly I just wanna listen to the rest of my music instead of some dumb pop up ad ruin it and go back to the beginning, and be able to skip as much as I want instead of forcing me to listen to your suggested songs and force me to listen to songs I dont like"
"It sucks. The first little while I had it on my phone,it was :) think I might have activated the free trial or something, but after a while, it disabled the queue button so I couldn't see what was next, AND it stopped me from skipping songs. You need PREMIUM to skip songs?! Are you serious?! Screw you, I'm listening to Amazon music now. Also it keeps playing songs that are not on my playlist and I hate it. Everyone, DO NOT get this app, go listen to apple music or Amazon music or ANYTHING ELSE!"
"This app sucks. It is complicated and non intuitive. It takes forever to navigate, I still haven't figured out how to watch podcast videos. You STILL can't listen to what you want, just terribly curated playlists. Every ""greatest hits"" playlist is made up of all songs you've never heard. It's a terrible app."
❤️Da lo Spotify ❤️Da lo ads. Very annoyed with back to back ads (Promoting Nasty Spotify premium ads With 90 sec time). Very disgusting. I have never seen this kinda buisness (Very pathetic). Shame of you Spotify 😏. You don't even deserve a single star rating.....any way I gave it to you ( my opinion ).
Never wanted to leave a negative review after an update. Spotify just got way more complicated and less intuitive to use.
"Podcasts will randomly be unavailable. Will delete downloaded podcasts/songs. They need to stop updating the UI and solve the critical errors with reported ""broken internet connectivity"" (when every other app if fine), fail to load/save podcasts with plenty of space on phone. Problems have been persistent across devices."
"UI is also continuing to get worse. Everything was one or two clicks away, now I have to dig just to find where my new podcasts went. This app is only getting worse."
"Terrible. I've never contemplated suicide before, then I heard spotify ads. Basically ""bugs"" and plays double the ads and costs more than AAA per month so you don't have to hear the Charmin Mega Rolls song.... I hate my life now."
"I've been using Spotify premium for years but I think it's time to switch to a better streaming service. The biggest problem is LACK OF AN ACTUAL SHUFFLE FUNCTION. Spotify's ""shuffle"" uses a bunch of fancy tech, but ends up being the worst shuffle feature by only playing the same 25 or so songs every time you play a playlist. Whether by bad design or business decision, this really sucks. Zero randomness in shuffle. Also their discovery and interface have gotten progressively worse over time."
"horrible, I don't understand how spotify was able to become such monopoly with all the limitations, swaping individual songs on mobile is difficult, under linuxu does not work well. actually don't see how it is better than playing music from YouTube?"
Should change the name from Spotify to adify. I know we can't get anything for free. But 2-3 ads after each song!! A person not having a premium account have to listen more ads than songs. Better to uninstall this and download songs on your device. As they both will acquire similar space.
"Spotify is the standard so they don't have to try. Terrible UI, crashes all the time, stops playing, fails to load, freezes."
"I never like when a company forces me to anything. I don't want to listen to podcasts, so don't force them on the main screen. Also the UI should incorporate more gestures instead of small icons."
Non funtional app. I curse joe rogan every day i have to try to work this terrible app like an old beater car that has all kinds of tricks to get her going. I look up at the sky and thank the lord jesus up above on the rare occasion it functions as it should. I can stream a live nfl game at work yet its not quite a good enough connection to listen to an audio only podcast on spotify. Hands down the most frustrating app i have ever used
"After opening the app, i cant log in from facebook and email address as it says it doesnt exist then tried forgetting password but didnt work as well but when I try signing up, it says it already exists. I'm having so much hard time figuring out what to do as there is no help or contact button."
"Cannot leave reviews for podcasts. This issue has been brought up multiple times on your ""Idea"" submission website. New Idea submissions are redirected to an old Idea that didn't pass your needed-number-of-upvotes-in-a-given-amount-of-time requirement. If Spotify doesn't care about user reviews then it won't care about this one."
"Good music streaming app ,with a wide variety of songs and podcasts. The cons are obviously the advisements which are way too frequent and annoying. Recently the advertisement frequency have increased like 2 or 3 adds are continously going onn ruining the zeal to use the app anymore."
Paid for Spotify premium for Family but family lives in different addresses...needed help to set this up once I paid and once i told support they stay different locations locations they disabled that family premium function and reverted it to Individual premium account without refunding difference. Support refuses to help if you have this problem. Ads on non premium are a nuisance.
"garbage app, the way they push ads too is super annoying compared to soundcloud, also just straight up cutting system audio when switching to the app the get a share copy link while listening to soundcloud, also spotify somehow force quitting soundcloud. literally uninstall this garbage app"
"Update ruined it. So, basically, YOU CAN NO LONGER REWIND OR FAST FORWARD SONGS. You can only skip SIX SONGS AN HOUR. If you want to listen to a certain song, you must listen through MULTIPLE other songs first. Greedy Asses Really."
"It started great! The sound quality is good, and the selection is wonderful!!! Why the 1 star? Because it keeps recommending soft core porn to me in podcast form ON MY HOME SCREEN WHEN I OPEN IT UP! I can't let my niece or nephews use my spotify anymore, as it isn't listed as ""explicit"", so you can't block it. I tried contacting customer support, they suggest you go to their community page to create a ""vote"" poll before they consider it. There is already a poll with required votes, it's ignored"
Major issue with many podcasts filling up my library with no way to quicky remove many at a time. Once you download a video to audio format there is no way to continue watching the video later. Please add on/off option to swipe to next podcast. Seperate podcasts and music even more.
"I'm about to give up. I am not going through this everytime a payment doesn't gp through. A ""retry payment"" button would be so much easier than having to hunt down a way to pay the subscription. I already didn't feel like it was worth the money, but it definitely is not worth the hassle."
"Frequently breaks and I have to reinstall. UI updates often make product worse, not better. Plays commercials during Spotify-owned podcasts, even if you're a subscriber (eg Gimlet). To top it off they also own and promote the podcast made by anti-vaxxer and horse dewormer proponent Joe Rogan. Spotify hates science, users, and logic."
"The app will go into car mode and turn off video even if it's disabled. My phone does it with random Bluetooth earbuds. Off means off, get your liability lawyers out of app design, or give a manual override that WORKS."
yeah this app have a lot of songs and is great but why do you have to force us to listen to the songs u choose for us? like I only have 5 songs in my playlist and I just want to listen to this 5 why the heck don't u let me? and yes I didnt buy the premium. But pls don't force us to listen to smtg we didn't add it make the whole user experience drop a lot. Not user friendly.
"Horrible syncing with google home. And it sometimes restarts playlist after going in the app. Also the music player appears in quick settings even after closing the app, and there's no way to close it."
"It fails more and more with each update. Doesn't sync properly with the Windows app, the Shuffle Play button for playlists should have the option to change the behaviour from Settings."
"You're gonna listen to our podcasts and you're gonna like it! So muched forced content onto the home page is just a jumbled mess. Not to mention it's basically ruined the Android Auto experience. I have to scroll down 3 times at least to get past podcasts (that I don't listen to) to get to daily mixes. I know the podcast game is lucrative, which is why I use Pocket Casts. So I can subscribe via someone's Patreon and add the RSS feed. Spotify doesn't want you going outside of them though."
"I love Spotify, but this app is useless. It's just a way of frustrating you into buying premium. Most of the things premium offers, you can also get for free by using Spotify on desktop. But they unnecessarily nerf the app by limit the amount of skips you get per hour, only allowing shuffle (including if you just try to search for a specific song, no guarantee it'll be the one you actually searched for) and even if they didn't, the whole experience is sub-par. Frankly it's quite ridiculous."
Waste app ! I wanted to listen one song that's it but spotify had other plans instead of one ad spotify has given 3 ads (30 sec each ) worst app they don't even consider user experience! Senseless people ! For namesake spotify but waste features instead opt for YouTube atleast they give skip ad feature 🤦‍♂️
The worst app I have ever used... I know that ads are required to keep them going but having 3 ads b/w 2 consecutive songs is just absurd and extremely irritable.
You can't sort the playlist now because the play button occludes the sort button I have tried it on multiple devices trying to change the resolution and I can find no way to click on the sort button for my playlist like I used to be able to they need to move it over I wonder if there's any way to restore the old UI on this
Since the update Spotify opens when it wants even when not prompted. Doesn't reflect what I'm listening to at all. And Doesn't stop when I exit the app?? First time ever having these issues and it's really a nuisance
Why on earth would you design your app to require an internet connection before I can access the podcasts that I've downloaded for offline playback the night before?! This app was great before Spotify started leaning so heavily into podcasts and now I have to sift through podcasts and podcast suggestions before I can listen to my music. They tried to fix what wasn't broken.
"Nice to search songs. However, it o ly plays a portion of a favorite I select then stops & starts playing something else on a playlist I did not create. If a membership to s required it makes more sense. To buy the CD instead. Won't have se this app if that is the case."
"I God dammit hate this app, it used to work very fine for me at 1st, but the update ruined everything, if I would play a song from my favorites/liked songs it would play only a few of them, then it would play random songs I don't even know or like to hear, I want the old Spotify back."
They keep adding songs to my Playlist that I don't want to listen to. I remove them and Spotify keeps adding terrible songs. I'm deleting the app and I'll just use YouTube for music. Thanks for ruining a good app.
"It's a turkey. It's a lemon. It's spotify. It's INSUFFERABLE! Stewie Wonder and Metin Şentürk can together make a better UI than this one. I cannot find a suitable analogy for UX right now, just feel free to use your wildest imagination about garbage."
I used to love Spotify.. but it has taken a turn for worse.. The ads tht wer earlier in bw the playlist are now between every song.. its unbearable.. They should understand not everyone needs a premium service and basic features are enough.. but this is ruining the entire experience.. even when you open the app after a while and play any song the ad pops up.. i cant even shift thru playlists anymore.. if an alternative is available im leaving
Spotify; the app which is just getting worse and worse. In the last one year these bugs came up and never left: - My downloads disappeared multiple times I live in a rural area with slow 4g and no WiFi so this is a 5stars frustration there. - The app literally lost it is ability to be responsive. I tap here and there and the playback changes 30 seconds later. - It keeps says I am offline while I can't access offline functions like queuing. Award to Spoti: The most buggy app I have on my phone.
"Loved it before the recent update. The phrase ""hey spotify"" doesn't work anymore. It requires you to press the microphone which defeats the purpose of vehicle mode."
Horrible bug. I'm on vacation and have spotty reception. I was trying to add songs to a playlist of my favorite songs and download them and I clicked the colab button by mistake. It deleted ALL my downloaded songs that weren't on other offline playlists! Now over 90% of my songs are missing!
"The new update just ruined spotify. Booting up the app is now twice as long, everything is just so SLOW. Before the update, Spotify was alot faster and simpler. I hope they change their stupid update back."
"I'm not sure why my alps went backwards. I LOVE car mode ! so when my phone update and there was a little car mode button on the corner I was pretty jazzed, didn't have to go to setting to go back to full features. So imagine my dismay when purchasing my new phone today, with the newest updated version of Spotify and it had no car mode button 😑 the phone just came out 3 days ago, you think it would have the same up to date features as my 3 year old phone I just dumped..."
"I love Spotify!! However, the app just quit working today and it hasn't worked since about 630am today. What's going on? Server issue? I can't give it more than 1 star until you guys fix whatever made it quit working today. 😔"
"Too many ads. They created an issue and are now selling the solution. Navigating this app and it copius ads Is a Genuinely terrible experience. I can't count how many times I've opened this app up, listened to a single song and then been given 3 minutes of ads. If I could give it less than one star I would. I would give my left nut to be able slap the back of these execs newborn heads with the raw strength of our monkey ancestors primal rage. This is a Despicably manipulating app. And they know."
"Is this app is a bad joke? Music controls are trash compared to even the default Samsung or Apple music app. Can only skip 6 songs per hour, and many of the 'what should be default controls' are locked behind a $10/month premium pay-wall. The design of the app isn't terrible, it is however all over the place and un-optimized. Sure Spotify has an incredibly large library which is nice, but wow the app is just hot garbage. I'm deleting the app."
"Constant advertising and pushing to upgrade to premium in free version. Would be acceptable if it wasn't several times louder than the music - loud enough to be painful. Can't upgrade because I'm abroad and Spotify requires a *local* credit card. Will I upgrade when I can again? Probably not, because by now I am extremely upset about the extra loud advertising."
"It trick you into staying by giving you premium features for free without telling you and after a while doesn't let you skip more than 6 times and plays you loads of adverts and then plays you a random song that you never asked for, I got bored of it and deleted the app. There's a huge buzz about Spotify and I finally decided to get it but then they ruined it by doing that, amazon music is way better"
"Pfff, number #1? Plus it's not offline, and the songs are shuffled, you can't even choose the song you want and if I want to make a list of songs, it will give you a shuffle button and when you press ""edit playlist"" it will show songs that u don't need and pressing your favorite song will just make the song you pressed , shorter, like honestly I don't like this app at ALL"
"Saturday. Heading to the airport. Boarding. Take off. I'm putting my headphones on, gonna listen to my favorite music. Opening Spotify and surprise: after being with Spotify for 6 years they decided, that I need to verify my account. And the screen is undismissable! Unbelievable. Dear Spotify it is not quite easy to verify the email when you in 10km height. Worst user experience ever. Terrible job Spotify"
Voice activation used to work but since update no more used to be able to say hey spotify now it's a button that shows up only once in a while why add a feature just to take it away seriously considering dropping this app and going to xm or padora
Useless! I pay for premium and every single song I play on any players stops every 5-10 seconds! I have to press a button on my phone or open the app for it to continue playing! May as well not pay and listen to adverts!
"I am using spotify since 1 year without any problem on same device galaxy note 20. However, since a past week I am facing many aapp crashes and in app crashes. Like I don't able see what's playing but there is some music playing in background. Also, sometimes I can't able to use any buttons on spotify so, I can't change song and serf on app. Why I am paying...😤😪"
"Pretty terrible UI. Zero interface customization settings. Works ok for music, terrible experience trying to play podcasts offline."
"Horrible ui. It's obvious their only priority is to try to manipulate users into clicking their most profitable links. I was forced to use this app for Joe Rogan, real close to just not listening anymore, because the app is that bad. If you are an organized person like me, Spotify will make you go insane."
"Poor at best, purchased membership just for podcast. App is constantly freezing or pausing and ruining conversations with commercials right in the middle then followed by more pausing. With only the app working it constantly needs you to press play to get it to work. Worthless. If it bugs one more time I'm canceling for sure for sure"
"Terribly designed, no swipe to que? People have been asking for this feature for years. Not to mention it's buggy as all hell if you're phone isn't the Samsung 21000"
"The chaos in this app ruins great music. You can not play what you want because it is like an agressive radio station. I have tried to buy premium and it actually won't let me because it thinks I already used a free month, but I have not. It wants to force me buy a duo account or a family account and will not even take my money as an individual. There is nobody to contact for support and this is just super annoying. Youtube is better with ads than this nonstop bullying, upselling con job."
"Old outdated UI left on the Android version. iOS version got big beautiful background covers, typography updates, etc. A long time ago. Spotify: come on. There are lots of us here. Show us some love."
This is by far the worst app (in design and usage). I would recommend using anything but this. It does nothing right. I use Podcast Republic every day and it's a Lamborghini compared to this gremlin of an app. I use this festering turd of an app for one purpose only because they acquired my favourite podcast. Just to use this app I turn my data off cause cause it constantly sucks on your data. When and if I find a exploit to bypass using this app I will gladly do so.
Playback stops every 10 minutes. The latest update has the stop playback glitch. I have to manually press play to resume a song. I am currently using Apple Music and that App has been great. Fix quickly or I will cancel to switch over to another App.
"I made perfect playlist for my ears, and then app added suggested songs I DON'T LIKE and ruined my playlist. I want to listen to music I love, not music you think I might like. How can I listen to playlists I MADE without interruptions??"
"Please developers..I used to love this app, bu the no. of ads ruined everything. That is my only concern. Music is a right to everyone I suppose and no one needs only, I mean ur only subscription to listen to it. So please stop irritating with these annoying ads, I'm so done with them. I don't wanna listen to that guys tour or the girl stopping him, and all that drama. Please,stop spaming every now and then with ads🙏🏻"
"The only app on my phone which can't seem to figure out to connect to my Chromecast, including an app I built over a weekend. Also the recommendation algorithms are trash."
"Can't cancel the paid version unless you are on a web browser. It messes up your playlists, constantly. The drive mode feature enables itself and is counterintuitive. I hate the app."
"I probably have listened to more ads than songs by the time Im writing this. I wish this was my only complain, sadly the app keeps breaking when I try to open it 90% of the time it will say I have no internet connection when I clearly do and when I clearly can open Youtube or anything else that requires internet seconds later and everything will be fine. The app used to have a feature that would allow you to listen to an ad to gain 30 minutes of ad free listening time but that is long gone."
Worst layout and design for music app I have ever seen. Apple music is so much better and has more of a range of songs. How bout you resign your app.
"Absolutely garbage interface. I have premium, theres no skip/rewind track buttons, continues to be stuck on the last podcast I listened to weeks ago. Automatically starts plays what ever I last listened to without hitting play. Music/podcast randomly stop playing weather I'm wearing earbud, listening there's blue tooth speaker, in the car. Definitely canceling. COMPLETE GARBAGE, aside from actual content. Which you basically can't listen to because the app is garbage.."
"The app has been lagging so much for months now I'm basically unable to use it. It takes a long time to open, not to mention load anything. Playing any playlist is impossible if I want to do quickly (even if I have them downloaded). I have the premium plan and I can't even use it properly."
"Great app but they keep updating it just to remove features, rearrange the ui (making it worse) and break things. I turned it on today just to see that my ""liked songs"" playlist of 3300 songs had been undownloaded for no reason, and when trying to redownload it only downloads 1800 of them for some reason."
Congratulations to Spotify for ruining a perfectly good app with your money grabbing BS forcing people to pay so they are able to listen to their own playlist not on shuffle and select which songs they want to listen to from their own playlist is ridiculous money hungry bull you have taken what was until recently a wonderful app and turned it into absolute garbage you should absolutely be ashamed of yourself and either get rid of this abomination and that was once a good application or return it
"Spotify India has aggressively tuned advertisements that keeps asking to upgrade to premium account, which sounds like a threat. I have slowly started to avoid Spotify. If you're going to ruin a user's mood by constantly pushing to get the premium account, why even bother having a free app then?"
Buggy. Scrolling through playlists or podcast episodes is almost impossible. User interface is unintuitive and constantly changing.
"- no way to listen to multiple playlists - weird, unintuitive operations (playlist ordering is hidden away like /that/?) - no play all my music - no separation between podcasts & music - weird & useless lyrics thingy - no gestures to open/close player, but to skip songs??? - confusing queues (why are there two?) - slow animation on every menu, would be less of a problem if stuff like liking weren't hidden away in there - no indications on where there are menus - no full list of an artists songs"
Get rid of the ability of having ads every two or one song its annoying and why did you remove the watch 30 minutes of unnaruptive listening? Quit trying to be greedy and shove ads down our thoughts just so we can buy premium and some can't afford or have a credit card to buy premium >:( bring back unnaruptive listening I rather listen to one ad for 30 mins of no stupid ads. Thanks!
"I don't understand why I can't set an established podcast from oldest to newest without it refreshing to not only playing it from the newest first, but if I do get the sort by button to stick, it will not remain in sequential order when I'm scrolling to find an older episode on my phone that I have not heard yet. So there are probably 200 episodes of history and true crime that I can't experience without figuring out a workaround. And how can I be sure that I won't have this with premium too 👎"
"The most ghetto/janky app out there. Podcast episodes play in no particular order, IF they even play at all. Queue is also erratic. All in all this is a dangerous app to drive with because it is so distracting and doesn't fulfill the basic task it was designed to do, which is PLAY."
"Cash grabbing criminal organisation with poor versions of songs. Paid for a year, couldn't download music or cancel subscription. If you want to complain they will force other methods and still steal ur money. YouTube music is significantly better. Spotify is the MySpace equivalent of fb. Null and void. I want my $200 back WITHOUT the legal or administrative loops u force the customer's through"
Uninstalled this app as it has serious battery drain issue with Samsung One UI. When you use Spotify songs as alarm tones it drains battery drastically. I've double checked this issue with other one UI users and the issue does exist.
Where tf is the repeat button? Not to mention they add irrelevant songs to my playlist. And when I listen to my playlist they don't play the right song. Would never recommend. Don't get it trust me.
I recently changed my review to a one-star because after months of paying for premium I'm still listening to ads on podcast your platform does not seem to save my place correctly a lot of the times you need more updates and you need to quit asking people for money if you're going to put five or more ads in a podcast it's a bit ridiculous
"Whatever they did with the new update ruined the app. It stops playing randomly, doesn't show the correct song playing on the app, doesn't provide media controls in the notification bar like before, and sends a ""Spotify connections"" notification 3 times every hour or so."
Irony inside : The app UI is from the 80' I think. I doubt there's any good UI/UX designer in the team. Countless clicks to reach the most basic and rudimentary functions that exist in the simplest music players for decades. I'm not even talking about the awful algorithm that suggests musical genres that are hundreds of miles away from what I listen to. I've been listening to Black metal for years in premium Spotify and the algorithm suggests Bible and awful pop music LOL
why did yall take away the download all songs from a playlist button. why edit: I'm gonna give 1 star because I don't understand why you have to limit free users to this degree. I have premium now but I didn't use this app for a very long time when my last premium expired because it's impossible to use w a free account. You can't even pick through songs in an album?? You guys used to be cool a few years ago. also my question still stands: WHY DID YALL TAKE AWAY THE DOWNLOAD ALL BUTTON YOU---
"I was very enjoyed spotify before the update st July 2021. I know i just have a free acount, but this disgusting, I can't choose any other music, the play button will play shuffle of any other songs. If I search songs the app not show songs list again and changed with artist album I don't like it, i will remove spotify it's not my favourite again."
"Often won't start, requires restarting phone to work (even then you have to log off then log back in, to be told you have no internet connection, eventually it goes online then it seems to re-download all previously downloaded music) clearing cache and force start don't help. Then after a couple of days it won't start again. This is 2021 surely it should just work and not require so much user intervention, I don't have these sorts of problems with Google Podcasts (and thats free of charge)."
"Probably the worst UI of any music app. Songs get deleted at random and thus need to be re-downloaded, Interface just bugs out sometimes, long loading screens, etc"
The update ruined the app. Let people police themselves when it comes to driving mode. You can't even switch out of it once it's on driving mode!? It's really ruined Spotify for me. They need to switch back and focus on paying their artists instead of ruining the app.
The free app is terrible so you almost need to buy the premium. This app sucks it autoplays over anything else you play no matter what if Bluetooth is linked it plays Spotify. THEY PUT ADDS IN A PODCAST THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR ZERO ADDS abs it ruins the flow of the podcast
You got one new build to fix it. I'm not going to tell you what's wrong because I know that you know that app it's basically broken. Fix it or you will lose a customer and I'm taking all my friends with me. You got one build to do it and I'm waiting like millions of other paying customers who pay for an app and service that isn't working. I have to power cycle my phone just to get it to work again for a little while and have the best phone money can buy. It's the broken app.
"Current bugs: current position in podcast is grossly wrong, Spotify starts playing on its own anytime I get a notification, bug reporting system is non-existent. The UI updates are all awful, it's like they want you to hate using the app."
I paid for three months but it didn't show the lyrics button. I already uninstalled it like three times but it didn't work. It's very disappointing. Please fix it!
"I really only used this app for podcasts because it never really cut it for music for me (even with a free trial once upon a time), but now I have to use it for JRE. BRUH, this player will literally interrupt with 4 Ads and then restart the podcast for no reason. Sometimes it'll just skip to the next podcast for no reason. Not only was this a mediocre platform when I CHOSE to try to use it, but it is an utter disappointment as something I have to use. There are far better designed platforms."
"Junk podcast app. PAID PREMIUM still has ads before and during podcasts and app is unusable with ANY vpn, app REQUIRES location access. Offline mode requires you to disable vpn and download, then you must disable Offline mode every 2 days to re-sync or all you downloaded stuff is inaccessible. JUNK! I have tried the tech department and forums. No good solutions available."
"It's fast to load, has a good UI and huge library but is completely let down by the infuriating, useless shuffle feature. It just doesn't work. Playlists will have 10+ hours of music but you'll only ever hear the first 100 tracks of each, then it starts over. A 30 minute pause will reset the list. Come back from lunch and bam! the same first tracks, same order. Forums online will show you that it's been years and no acknowledgement by devs, just bs and useless non-fixes. Use YouTube music"
App constantly stops and quits. Then the app begins the podcast i was listening to in random places. Sometimes it restarts the podcast from the beginning or starts playing another random episode. Unbearable. The worst.
The new app is extremely unintuitive and hard to use. I want my music listening to be quick and simple. Not this clunky Spotify. I Uninstalled after being a user for many years.
"My music collection is far better and complete than spotify. Also, it's quite heavy to load when using my mobile data. It consumes my phone storage. In totality, I like the concept of spotify but it needs improvement and that's I think in far future. Well, the only thing that's constant is change, right?"
When opening the app from the home screen songs will automatically skip without touching the player widget or skip buttons. Podcasts will not save their place when I exit the app.
Premium user. Old Spotify was better... Songs keep getting removed and the updated layout is not near as user friendly. Also having issues with music continuing to play after I shut my screen off.
"I don't know who's idea it was to change the restart song button into a like song button but it doesn't matter. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK! I have all the songs I listen to in the liked folder and every time I try to play a song from the beginning on my home screen I accidentally remove the song from the playlist and then have to relike it which places it at the top of my playlist which I definitely DO NOT WANT TO DO... Also, can you make it so that the repeat button doesn't always reset when I chang"
"Despite the best engineering model that the world follows, including myself, and my total respect of The Spotify Agile Model (I'm also it's evangelist), the app just sucks. ""Play one song and it plays another"" this issue has been there since 2017 and it still persist. The internet is full of it. What's the point of all those Chapters, Squads, Tribes, Guilds, Trios and Alliances when a common user can't get his head around when they search for a song and hit play but it plays something else?"
"They have a tendency to ruin your mood while you play song to soothen by giving constant adds literally every time you open the app, change the song and even after clicking the no thanks option below the add and the special service add for telling that another add is gonna come really man it sucks. What's wrong with you guys not everyone wants to buy a plan or have a desire to download music and people have their own plans hope that you stop giving too many advertisements and dont prove us wrong"
"I've used Spotify for years and it's been great. But PLEASE will you stop doing completely pointless updates. The worst one yet is changing the skip back button on the lock screen to a ""like"" button. Idiotic. PLEASE SPOTIFY, REMOVE THE LIKE BUTTON ON THE LOCK SCREEN AND REPLACE IT WITH THE OLD SKIP BACK BUTTON. That is all 😂"
Ruined the app I can no longer just play a song I want it makes me auto shuffle I can't search up a song and listen to it without the song being on a different playlist and the app automatically added songs to my playlist I don't want on there
"This app has become truly awful for the last few months for me. I can no longer listen to my downloaded podcasts offline no matter what I do. Another thing is that it keeps constantly updating/re-downloading files I already have, just so they can update their ads. Spotify could be so helpful in spreading wisdom via free podcast episodes, but their stupid/greedy decisions and/or lack of bug fixing ruin this potential."
"What's with this new interface? It's a mess, and definitely not user friendly. Pls just... Go back to what it was before. Instead of filters, just leave the separate tabs. It's easier and better that way EDIT: why would we need the ""like"" button instead of the one to go back to the previous song? Seriously..."
"If a podcast has more than 100 episodes the app will only ever let you see the first or last 100 episodes no matter what you do, and if you listen to 100 it just restarts at 1 instead of continuing to 101. Also sometimes when i have no data or internet connection it won't play downloaded music."
Terrible new UI Sometimes the app freeze and still play music so have to force close it by going to the system settings.. I cannot believe I pay £9.99 for sucha terrible music steaming app
I used to like this app but the fact that there is no customer support and they remove songs or deem certain songs unplayable is BS in my opinion. I don't understand why songs like WAP are completely playable but when I want to listen to Antarctica by $uicideBoy$ it's deemed unplayable for no reason with no explanation.
"Wth happened to this app? I used to be able to sort my music with the click of a button, it used to work flawlessly. I have had the app for years and now I cancelled my subscription. I loved this app but features get taken away so why pay for it or use it."
"Bluetooth audio stutter after the latest update is really ruining the entire app for me. I changed to Spotify from apple music for this exact reason and now this happens, where do I go now?"
"You have gone absolutely crazy with your ads. Everytime I open the app to listen to some music, I am blasted with an ad. And they are 30 seconds long. They have driven me to such annoyance that I exit by pressing the home button, clearing my recents and again go back to Spotify but nope AGAIN THE SAME 30 SECOND AD. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined."
"The phone version is way worse than the PC version. There's only ""Shuffle play"" for a song. Songs are automatically added to my playlist and I don't want that. Please fix those 2 things. Make a ""play"" button not a ""shuffle play"" and make an option in the setting saying ""Add songs to playlists automatically (yes/no)"". The ads are not that annoying so I guess I'm not leaving this with 1 star."
I really like the app but the main problem is that the ads those irritating ads just ruin the vibe. I just can bear them. After every 2-3 songs an irritating ads shows up.😤😤😤I hope you'd remove the ads so that we can listen to songs peacefully.
"Podcast page is stuttering,hurting my eyes. I use 120Hz refresh rate Moto G40. Still... Ads are irritating. (Cross-device syncing is instantaneous - it's great! But can't use it anymore) Thanks to Google Podcast, it's free. UI is smooth!!"
"How in this world SPOTIFY has GARNERED enough favorable reviews to score a 4.4 star rating is quite amazing! We agree with ""Other's"" who point to runaway advertising and arbitrary listener lock-in methods by running repetitious Ads at the most inopportune times. This mentality of SPOTIFY absolutely demonstrates where their allegiance lays with NO regard for loyal listener retention. IT'S NOT THE SPOTIFY MUSIC/PODCAST APP WE USED TO KNOW! (Ref: Shreeya Nair + David Slinkard 08-03-21) stay clear!"
I am a premium user. 1. There is no option to reset preferences 2. There isn't a clear way to access user profiles 3. Lyrics not available on desktop and on mobile are sometimes wrong 4. Weekly Mixes are the same and repetitive because of a terrible algorithm that isn't allowing user to choose what music to see 5. A very counterintuitive approach to playlists 6. No way to see followers 7. Cannot see accesses / number of listens to private playlists. 8. No customization of the home page
"Could not listen to one song I searched for!! I would tap on the song I wanted to hear and it would play some other random song I've never even heard of. When I did actually listen to a song, it quit playing after that track and I'd have to TRY to find another song. Waste of time to download!!"
"Another pop up modal that I can't find in settings to get rid of? Who the hell thinks these are good ideas, I pay for premium to not be advertised to all the time. Why am I getting pop ups every time I open the app? UI/UX team listen up, this is bad design especially when I'm driving down the road."
"I'm having so many issues with the app crashing at the moment. I leave it on to play songs and it crashes but continues playing and cannot be paused. Closing the app doesn't work, I have to go into settings and use ""force stop"". This is becoming very tedious - surely an app designed for playing music should be able to play without crashing ?"
"Honestly I don't like the app just because of the amount of Ads after 6 songs,and I can't even choose what song to play,and if I want to do that I have to buy premuim which is unfair.I recommend getting another app if u don't want ads to pop up every 3 min after a song"
ZERO STARS. They took away the ability to sort your playlist and instead put back the search bar. This functionality should be required and reinstated. Also allow us to pay for student premium all at once
"TRUTH OF SPOTIFY: On one hand Spotify claims taking it's users claim of abuse, seriously, & on the other hand it allows obscene content created by a third-party / individual artist, being broadcasted via its podcasts in native language. And there's no in-app button/provision to report the same. This issue is still persisting even after updating to the latest version of Spotify. Really disappointed in you, Spotify."
I went from joox to spotify bc i thought Spotify would be a better well built app... Man was i wrong. 1. App keeps freezing. 2. Keeps on telling me i need to go online even tho I'm connect to wifi. 3. Very poor support infrastructure. 4. 2-5 minutes after closing the app music starts playing out of nowhere. All this happened and i didn't even have to app for a month... I won't be going through with my premium membership. DO NOT WAIST MONEY ON THIS APP!!!
"Every update is a step in the wrong direction, they keep ruining the app little by little. The new ways they organize your music is just awful. Wish I could go back to the 2019 version"
Horrible experience. 1 I couldn't go back to the beginning of the songs. 2 A lot of very long irrelevant advertisements. 3 Anoying Advertising which ruined the exuberance of the songs.
"Clunky, buggy, bad UI, Can't search for specific episodes. Only tried this for back episodes of some podcasts.. Not worth the pain. I switched back to Podcast Republic."
"App has been broken since the nu-spotify GUI/update. You used to be able to like songs in playlists like your daily mix etc while offline. This was a great tool if you could fight their algorithm however since the app now hangs or crashes whenever attempting to like, or bring up the popup menu while offline the experience is beyond poor. They are aware of this bug for months but have yet to make any progress. This bug is so large that it impacts even disabling shuffle while playing from a daily mix because they moved that function to the popup menu too. It has broken every single mix or radio or playlist you have offline and the effort of remembering and setting aside time to add things later just is not worth it. This is a paid service at a hefty premium in 1st world countries so you would expect some degree of bug fixes but spotify have just left users in the dust."
"I'm playing My liked songs so why is there random song that I obviously didn't like piping up here and there? It's literally My liked songs not My like songs but we'll add a song here and there for half and hour, and some song I just hate I block the artist and press that button that ""they'll try and not play again"" and the report system is broken it doesn't even allow you to continue reporting"
"Once upon a time I was a big supporter - I've been a premium member for many years now. However, now, I kid you not I'm trialling apple music.. Because this new unnecessarily stupid layout has just ruined my experience of using the app and I've finally had enough. Ps my trial of apple music is going well, most likely will make the switch."
Its extremely annoying that if I hit the play button when using a different app it will automatically open and start play over the app thats open. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop it.
"Like irt for my taste in music , but hate the watch a ad for 30 mins free music, more lije 15 mins before a another ad pops up. Or i would give it 5* . nd it expensive at£9.99 per month for people who likes the app but cant afford premuim. . but students can get it for only £5.99 . unemployed should get the premuim for £2.99 monthly."
"unskippable ads, the inability to play a playlist or even single song without an unbelievably incompetent shuffle algorithm and best of all, the UI works about as well as if it was programmed in by the thousand or so monkeys taking a break from writing Shakespeare on their typewriters"
App almost never loads up. If i can get it going it will randomly pause and quit working. Runs extremely slow. 90s dial up is faster than this app. I've tried it on wifi and data.
"The app, in the subscription sucks. It does not recognise properly nor quickly internet absence (when internet is not present should play offline music). Albums listings are incomplete. Like and use the podcasts part. Stable enough. Just pay more to the artists, value the cover art (spotify treatment on this is at least to say, laughable). I know some Portuguese acts with millions of auditions and receiving annual fees of near 0."
"You had the best music and podcast service by far, and made it completely unusable. I'm considering switching. Why does an app need 10m to load what it has *down*loaded? Why, when I'm only listening to downloaded content, does it use 3GB of data when I'm on cellular? The old GUI worked perfectly, no time to load downloaded material, in one clear list. Now it needs internet to search through my downloaded content, and I had to bar it from cellular to prevent using the 5GB in a day. PLEASE FIX IT"
"They are quite a bit excessive with the ads, if I listen to 1 30 second ad, I should get 30 mons of music ad free, but these guys play 3 30 second ads every other song. Com'on guys quit being so greedy. I heard pandora isn't this bad."
"I hate how many ads there are on this app, it fills me with rage with its oxymoron. I could cry due to the fact I feel so much h pain opening this app to cause insufferable damage to my mental health with each ad. I have no idea how long it will to recover, but I'm hoping myself a quick one."
I was actually considering buying the premium after using it for few months but the recent surge in the ads yeah no I'm switching to other platforms. Keep ruining user's experience with ads. 👍
Why is there so many ads this wasnt happening as much before why so many if i play the foward button or a new playlist it automatically gives a ad every single time i get you want pple to get premium but this only drives people to delete the app.i liked it when it only had 2 ads every 5 songs or 4
Honestly I want to give zero star to this app not because of design or anything but the way they play songs in between ads I couldn't enjoy my ads because of songs interruption.
Can u introduce global public commenting feature on songs:) Edit: I am now fed up with the continuous ads...As I am not continuously listening to music on spotify I have not subscribed to a premium plan. Now its like 3 ads after 2 songs... If it was commercials there is altleast some use...but we keep on hearing spotify ads inside spotify app...tbh it sucks and eventhough the ui is clean compared to similar apps i feel people are switching from this app due to this disturbance~:(
"I am not paying for premium and I am not using this app until they cut down on the ads. I get one song followed by 4 ads or more quite often. It is completely unacceptable. This used to be a good app for, but not anymore. Now I spend more time listening to ads than music. Just horrible."
"The app has become very difficult to navigate. Finding ""Made for you"" is now impossible. Constantly get ""Something went wrong"" errors when trying to use the search feature. Filled to the brim with bugs and terrible UI, with so much space taken up by what are essentially adverts for things you've never listened to. Terrible app that needs a big overhall."
really poorly designed app for how much you pay. Not connected to internet? Nothing will load even if it's download. Constantly displays the wrong song. podcast menus are convoluted
Podcast recommendations every time I open the app is annoying. I can't turn off the recommendations either. The app is difficult to navigate quickly or on the go.
I've had the app for quite some time. Very please with it until recently. I can't log in and to get the app to hook up with my bluetooth. Telling me I don't have internet and I'm logged in checking emails. Someone needs to figure it out.
WORST APP EVER!!!! It won't let me listen a song in my favorite song!!!!! You can only listen to songs in your favorites when you click the shuffle button!!!! WORST APP EVER
Everytime I get in the car I have start-stop-restart the app to get song info displayed correctly. Search results not well presented and required a lot of navigation to find content. Search results presented very poorly. About ready to drop Spotify and go back to Amazon over these issues
"Super scummy cancel process. Makes you hit cancel 5 different times hidden on 5 different pages. Each time you think you've canceled they need you to click another cancel button. Clearly they're hoping you think you canceled in one of the previous 4 cancel pages and leave the site, and then later you get surprise charged because you didn't complete the process. Scummy practice."
"I'm not even sure what I'm paying for lately. The app gets glitchier, not better. The latest frustration is when it just doesn't want to recognize the play button! Yep, get ready to close and relaunch the app numerous times before it decides to actually play effing music."
"Terrible non-premium experience. I have had premium for a while now, then decide d to cancel the subscription. Unable to select sings in an album, your forced to shuffle them. Can't select songs from liked songs, only plays 5 seconds of the song. Terrible user experience, pretty much forces you to have premium to have a good app. The Console version is better now."
Ruined the best podcast of all time. App is absolutely horrible. What's the point of downloading something you can't listen too or watch without service. Nor can watch video pods on your tv.
"Extremely basic, poor performance. Incomplete UI. If it wasn't for the content it wouldn't be worth it."
"Ever since the most recent update music rarely plays, and when it dose, its normally only ten seconds, sometimes it dose work for a song, but only for one song. Then its back to silence. This isnt just a me problem either, their are tons of people expierencing this, so if spotify wants us to keep using their app, they have to fix app ruining bugs like this and try not to let them happen again. Its honestly embarrasing that the supposed #1 music streaming service is letting this happen."
"Ew. Spotify desktop is way better, and YT music better than that. This is mostly because of the ads every 10 seconds, and the inability to skip as many songs as I want without premium. On top of this, it is counter intuitive, difficult to operate and overall a very clunky app."
musik and Podcasts should be more seperate. umfortunately the new ui update made this even worse. even more podcasts now at this point i dont even discover new music from spotify i only listen to things i search for directly. this is really sad the Service itself would be good but his new ui is completely against listening music and only ment to get us to listen to more pdcasts
Recently with last two updates spotify is broken and is crashing a lot on android 12. It freezes whole system for about a minute or so everytime I start playing music. Sometimes song is added to player but it never plays on a strong network connection too and even when its downloaded for offline listening. Very trash experience after some latest updates. I know you guys will blame android 12 beta builds for this but no other platform is causing this issue on android 12. Also sound quality is trash compared to jiosaavan and youtube music. Spotify sound is simply not loud enough. I have turned volume mode to loud and sound quality is very high. But it simply doesn't cut it for me. I am loosing a lot of details in songs simply because of quality is not good enough. Also all the complaints that I had I wrote it here so dont ask me to write a mail to spotify support because I did and you never took action on it. Your team didn't even read that email. I will look for another month and if situation doesn't improve I will have to unsubscribe. Terrible Experience.
Being music app this is good but after every 2-3 songs there is ad. It may be 1 or 2 or sometime 3. So ad is too much interruptional and it will ruine your experience. A time will come when you will get so much interrupted and you just wanna get rid off with it. Next is your choice
"Horrendously glitchy. Goes through various glitches but my fave (not) is when I've been paying music in my car , connected via Bluetooth , turn off my engine, get out the car. Spotify will NOT stop playing ... the pause button doesn't work so I actually end up having to delete the app from my phone or it would keep playing all day 😤"
App constantly crashes and doesn't work. I pay for premium but am constantly bombarded with their payola playlists and other nonsense I'm not interested in. Streams for artists I do listen to are unequivocally filtered.
Terrible UX/UI. Discovering new content is a major pain. Constantly trying to shove podcasts down my throat despite me having ZERO interest in podcasts. Even with a premium subscription I'm seeing pop-up ads on my homepage.
The constant buggy updates that completely break the user experience are ruining this application. The new bugs that appear and workarounds you need to find are not conducive of an application I spend over $100 a year on.
Horrible... The latest update/s has pretty much soured my entire experience with this app... Firstly the fact that I can't see half the music in my albums when offline and this new cumbersome UI 😤🤦🏿‍♂️
"I have been very happy with spotify in the past, but recently the app crashes about every 10 minutes or so. It keeps playing music when it crashes but i cant control how loud it is or even get it to stop which can be quite annoying especially since the app needs about 3 min till it realises that it doesnt work. Not an app worth paying for anymore."
"actually it's an BUGGY ADWARE with some music inside! enjoy listening 10 mins ADS for 3 mins music. also I really hate its design! it even won't let you choose the music you want! you should SHUFFLE with 6 skips per hour, so MAYBE you reach the song you want. because of that I use SoundCloud. it's the WORST User Experience I've ever had in mobile apps since 2010."
The app is for advertisement. In between I listen some songs. Normally one advertisement is enough for rest of apps but Spotify tells that for at least 3-4 times. This app is literally begging for people to buy premium. We students are also using your application. I guess this app is not student friendly. Now you've surpass the limit of irritation. Thank you. But still using because I like the interface and graphics of this app. 😒
"Every update just keeps making the UI more inconsistent with each other. Why is it that on my liked songs shuffle play is displayed with a pill shaped icon while added playlist displays the play button in a circle. There's just no cohesiveness in terms of its UI and why in the ""Your Library"" so confusing to navigate now. I just miss that hamburger menu days where the UI is simple and cohesive. I hate using google apps but I would rather switch to YT Music."
"I've had premium for years. Now it just will not play my podcasts. I hit play and nothing happens. If I switch to searching for music it plays the music. I mostly listen to podcasts all day so if this doesn't get fixed there's really no point in keeping the subscription. I also hate the new format. There was nothing wrong with the old one. I just don't understand why you would do your best to ruin this app. Why? It was great, now it's worthless."
"Spotify's data aquisition, analysis, and usage of it is so creepy. They focus on having most of the mainstream musicians and often remove some of the best and most memorable older albums from your favorite artists. The cost for premium is too high for everything they get from it and what you get from it. Musicians have commented on how unbalanced they monetary system is and how it benefits spotify the most. I am not pleased with their business methods and ways of treating their users."
"Was honestly expecting better... The playback function is absolutely confusing. Can't loop queue, it just loops the ""next from"" category. When I move a song from the queue to ""next from"" it doesn't add it to the loop. When i finish listening to a song from the queue it completely disappears- even when i click the previous song button it doesn't play the right one. Why does the queue function even exist?? You should also be able to scroll up when on the ""queue"" screen and see your history."
Change it back stop updating. Why do people always gotta ruin or make things harder. I go into my playlist and it shows me things i may like and i cant play my songs individually like before now it previews them. Now i have to skip songs and get ads to get to the song i want. Stop changing stuff just cuz you feel like it. Keep it the same as before. Stop it.
"I quit I really do , if I'm listening to music via Spotify be it via earphones or Bluetooth audio if the phone rings it , Spotify closes and I have to restart it not helping"
"Terrible app with constant bugs, and new bugs all the time. App design in bad, library management and search is way worse than competitors. The app often struggles to play music, go offline/online, randomly stops playing and refuses to start... Sometimes the app doesn't even open. Force stopping helps sometimes but not always. Updates occasionally fix a bug (while introducing 2 more), but they spend more time redoing the UI every couple months and making it worse in the process."
"Phone: S21 Ultra 1- song preview frozen, doesn't update when song changes 2- always says nothing is playing even when it is, to pause music I need to hit the play button twice 3- when i disconnect bluetooth headphones music starts playing from phone instead of pausing. 4- buttons on bluetooth headphones won't pause/play music (Bose QC35 ll) 5- music keeps pausing every 5 minutes Completely broken App since updating my phone from an S8+ to the S21 Ultra.... FIX IT!"
I used to love this service. However I am uninstalling and canceling my subscription. All because of snacks daily. That is the worst podcast or service in the history of this planet is so annoying it is unreal. The fact that you actually change the skip forward button to Simply make it fast forward 15 seconds is the most disgusting disservice I have experienced as a paying customer. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. I won't be the last one to leave over this...
"The most recent update has completely ruined Spotify for me. Myself and multiple friends have had nothing but problems, on every device out there. About ready to find a different app to spend my money on"
The UI is complete freaking garbage. Half the time it's stuck of a load screen even when on wifi. I've been a premium member for 3 years but I'm done. I host canceled for too the terrible app. YouTube music is way better anyways.
"Switching between Bluetooth devices seems to mess up the apps ability to know what's playing, if it's actually paused or playing, and what skip should do. Considering I largely use it for podcasts and lo-fi playlists I can get through YouTube, starting to question the value of the subscription when the only reason I paid was for the UX."
TURN OFF AUTO SHUFFLE. There is no way to turn off a Playlist you create or an album from automatically shuffling. This is poor design. This is the worst usability function you have created and makes using the app useless for any sort of practice. This app was a 5 until this happened recently.
"Recommend the free pirate version because the original closes the app when it wants to/ doesn't open the app, stops playing music while I haven't touched the play button or changed from my mobile data and then it will take about 20 min for the app to actually open. This is my experience with premium."
"Spotify is so great with premium on mobile but its pretty much unusable without it. You can't actually listen to a full song, you get to listen to a clip and if you want to hear the full thing you have to listen to a playlist and skip to hear. They also add more songs to playlists without your permission, I love making playlists and have specific ones and spotify kinda just ruins them by adding songs. Disappointing, the desktop version is 100x better."
"Quite a lot of songs aren't available. Can we just go back to the last version??? The artist profile is changed and thats kinda disturbing!! And WHY DON'T I HAVE THE LYRICS FEATURE FOR ANY SONG???? LIKE ANY SONG?? There were Genius lyrics features for some songs only and even in that there were song info and all and lyrics didn't use to show! Now, I don't have that either!!!! Becoming worse!"
I used to LOVE Spotify but after its redesign it has become the worst app I own. I pay for premium since I don't have 4G and despite content being downloaded it still always wants internet. Now it NEVER leads its just a black screen of nothing with or without internet. I'll be canceling my subscription and using a different service soon.
"Since the UX redesign I'm having constant issues with the app being unresponsive and needing to be force closed, this occurs multiple times an hour. I am close to changing to another streaming service whose app won't render my phone useless every few minutes."
"It boggles my mind how their UX team gets away with this crime of an app. Updating to say that this app is still a terrible user experience. The only reason I'm using it is because it has the most content. It is, otherwise, a garbage attempt at a useable application."
"Can't listen to podcasts downloaded when offline. I'm often out an about and listen to podcasts on my tablet when there is no wifi available, but recently when I try to access the podcasts I've downloaded it requires an internet connection. What's the point of downloading them if I need to connect to the internet to listen to them? Until Spotify fixes this issue I'm going to find an alternative app for my podcast needs."
Always persistent on making the users to buy premium that they started playing ads for 30mins straight and ruined the workout session. Thanks ! Uninstalling the app.
"I have the Galaxy S10. The last few months there has been a spotify app glitch where no matter what song you listen to, the previous song title, name and picture is still displayed. Like it's stuck on another playlist. You then can't press the play, pause and shuffle buttons for the new song you're listen to. It also pauses and stops my music and podcasts randomly. Please fix this glitch!!"
"One star for attention, I have a free idea for the developers, rather than just have a like button it should be a designated playlist button where you can choose which playlist you want to add to then set it as the like button and add songs in one click rather than 3 clicks to make a playlist, make building multiple playlists easy with the chosen playlist button. Would prefer if a low level employee takes the idea and make some money, good luck"
"I would love this app even more if when creating my own Playlist the app would NOT add any random songs to my list. Seriously. I was recommended to this app as being the closest thing to iTunes for Android. Yeah, ruins my vibe."
I have issues with my voice option. 80% of the time I'll be screaming into the phone looking like a dingus trying to play one song. The song doesn't matter and this has been happening for quite some time.
"Now having used Spotify on 3 different phones, the one consistent problem I face is load times. Be it on data or Wi-Fi, the app always loads slowly. This includes the UI loading slowly and the songs loading slowly. For the music, I'll hit ""songs"" and it will load for sometimes upwards of a minute before displaying my music. And sometimes the library section just never loads making the app unusable. Don't even get me started on this app for Android auto... It's spoty at best."
The pc and console version are perfect but the mobile one is trash. You cannot play any full song from liked playlist and are required to use the search tool to find the song you want to listen to but that is also broken. When you tap on the song IT WILL MOST LIKELY PLAY A RANDOM SONG THAT YOU DID NOT PICK. That is soooo dumb please fix that
"Terrible user experience. Too hard to watch a video. If bluetooth is on, the app assumes I'm driving and won't display the video. Only got the app to watch Rogan's podcast. But can't even watch. Going back to YouTube to just watch JRE clips."
Does not working properly on my samsung A12. Often says there is no Internet or just takes minutes to start up. Requiring me to close all apps to get it to work. I had no issues with it on my huwawei.
"Draft kings ad completely ruins the app, it stops anything playing, freezes then when I close the app and relaunch it it goes to something completely different than what I was just listening to and plays the draft kings ad again when I go to resume what I was listening to"
"Absolutely terrible on Android. Just make it identical to the iOS version please. The UI isn't friendly at all, let me swipe down on whatever I'm listening to so I can minimize it."
"This app, or maybe Spotify itself, is starting to suck. I have a pay account so I can download content such as podcasts. Well, for the last few months Spotify requires to connect to the internet to play downloaded podcasts, regardless if you are in offline mode or not. Verified this on 3 phones I own. This really sucks when traveling a lot, a podcast ends and I can't listen to anything until I get a connection again, what's the point of paying money and downloading if I still need internet?"
"App was great. New mobile update has ruined it. They have grouped podcasts and music together and the rubbish new filter just means more clicks to simply select one of your podcasts or playlists. Really annoying. There should be a way to undo or reject unneccessary changes, made by spotify only because they are bored, not because they are needed. It was clearly updated by people who don't use the app daily or know that music and podcasts are different... And again. Every update makes it worse 😭"
Last update has ruined this app. It is playing two songs and a string of adds repeatedly. Currently I am looking for a replacement. If I could give 0 stars I would.
"This app has quit playing music. Sometimes I can get one song to play, but even that is a struggle. Most of the time, it won't even count one second. This is all since the latest update. My wife has the same problem with a different brand of phone."
"Once a great app, now having serious issues with a Samsung S21+ 5G. Doesn't display the correct song title(sometimes even the artist is incorrectly listed), play and pause buttons are unreliable and frequently don't do anything forcing you to sign out to stop the music."
"The recent update completely ruined everything for me. Started to not play my songs on the saved playlist despite clicking on the song several times and the interface going to the playlist messed everything. I enjoyed this app as I turn off the screen but now not even the app can connect to the Internet despite having connection. Please undo this update, and I will install it back."
After new update music will stop playing and I have to close the app and reopen to start listening again. Then same thing. Will play 2 or 3 songs and then quit. FIX IT SPOTIFY! I PAY FOR PREMIUM AND THIS IS NOT PREMIUM SERVICE!
"Why can you only long press and add to queue in search and nowhere else? Why is Spotify Connect often broken? Why do I keep spending money on a service where all development seems to be directed at rearranging buttons instead of fixing issues that's been there for years, like the incredibly poor Chromecast/Google Home experience?"
"I keep hitting the button to watch ads to have 30 minutes free from ads, but not even 8 minutes go by and more ads play. That's not cool at all. Anyone have suggestions for other music aps that don't do this?"
"After ""improving"" the playlist/artist/podcast sorting screen we have now ""improved"" the play button on the playlist screen into a tiny button on the far right while leaving the add songs button dead center. Please. Stop fixing. The app. It was not broken. It is twice as convuluted to navigate and use now than it was two updates ago."
Can we have the option to give ZERO or No Stars.? I installed Spotify only for a better user experience but it proved me WRONG. I am experiencing adds too often. Initially it was a bit irritating.. but now I feel they're CRITICIZING me for not buying the premium version. Sorry to say but I've un-installed this app. There are many better alternatives available now.
"Used to love this app. Have always used the free version, and can tolerate the ads, but don't put 4 random songs in a row into my playlist! Ruined my run!"
"#1-Why make it hard to make a payment?! I should be able to click on my plan under my profile and select a button (in the premium box) that says ""update payment."" It's THAT simple! Also, have a payment link AT THE TOP of the settings menu. #2-My Home page should be my Library! 1st thing I see! Then have ""for you"" store button and a search page button. #3-Podcasts and Music should be COMPLETELY SEPARATE pages (again)! #4 -Rid of circular tabs at top of library! Add downloads button in pods."
You're recommended content is overly political. Get off my screen. What are you updating. Spell it out. You'll never get more than 1 star from me until you do. Also your app constantly needs the forward button pressed to continue listening. What's the deal?
"AWFUL UPDATE - AVOID IF POSSIBLE Why is it now default to shuffle albums???? It's as if the development team at Spotify are actively trying to lose their jobs with these updates, and if possible I would rate this 0stars as this app is now doing it's best to ruin people's listening experiences. I hope they revert or fix this update soon"
"Roll back the ipdate. This sucks so much. I can't stand the big, chunky, Child like UI. All Companies do this nowadays. It sucks and I Will unsubscribe from premium next Month of they don't reset the UI. Also, quit shoving podcasts in my face, I listen to music, not podcasts."
"To remove a song from a playlist, the ONLY option is to go to the specific playlist and SCROLL THROUGH to find it, then remove it. You cannot use the 3Dot menu, whether in the list option (search, etc) or while playing the song. You MUST manually select it within the specific playlist from which you want it removed. Also, the ""Library Search"" feature DOES NOT return results if the song isn't ""Liked"", EVEN IF it's in one or more playlists. Also, awful new UI (lefty) added w/o my consent or update"
"Home screen is covered in podcasts recommendations after I accidentally played one. I hate podcasts, so annoying.. when will Spotify get their UI fixed??"
"useless animations add to a slow & sluggish experience. really bad UX, some actions are hidden behind menus, no customizable swipe actions, just annoying. patronizing app, doesn't allow customization, let me decide what's on my home screen! Please let me disable any appearance of podcasts! where is your changelog, I don't need you to tell me I should keep my updates enabled, I want you to tell me what you just updated !!"
"Poor user experience. Simply doesn't work well. Delays in opening, pausing, fast forwarding and rewinding, and others."
"This app is quite garabage without premium, for better free lostening, go to SoundCloud, please. Also they give me random songs which I don't like and don't want to listen to while I'm shuffling my liked songs Thanks Spotify! 😄👍"
"Used to be able to listen to Spotify for 12 hours straight then a month ago it started to quit after a pod cast and I had to reopen app to start, now im having trouble with it playing 10 mins fix this please"
"Downloaded songs got deleted thrice in a week. I'm using the latest Android version app, device - Samsung galaxy M51. This is top 2 feature for premium users, what's the point then, useless app? Ruined my hiking trip, considering to switch platform."
This is the worst music app when it comes to the free version. They don't let you skip songs as much as you want. They don't let you play whichever the song you want everytime. Other music apps are quite better than this like wynk music. Didn't expect this from Spotify you get nothing when you run it for free.
"App preformance since the UI update has ground to a stand still, in the 20+ second realm. Clicking any interface feature feels like it takes half a minute That and the new UI is super awkward and irritating, especially for offline listening. Episodes are categorised by show, so even on offline mode, when you select downloaded it shows the entire show, not your downloaded episodes"
"Pretty much no benifits to using Spotify if you already have YT Premium, they are constantly making their UI worse and worse for no reason and are removing songs (seemingly at random). On top of that, if you share an account, you will always be connected to one device, that you can't disconnect from without going to offline mode, or just muting their audio. Half of the screens have a different UI to all the others, and 75% of the time it just doesn't load or forgets that youre connected to WIFI"
Spotify needs to be fixed I can't create a playlist or delete old playlists not happy and the delete button is not working either and it's getting very difficult to use and the delete button needs to be fixed and no matter how old the playlist are they should be able to be deleted and create new playlist the delete button needs to be stronger and working properly but it's not please fix this asap please
"It was good till last update. After latest update, my spotify closes on its own as soon as i want to skip the song or just open the app. So i turn on the music and quickly turn my screen off but as soon as i open my mobile screen, it stop working and refresh again. I was highly satisfied with my spotify experience and don't want to give anyless than 5 star but this trouble is annoying. Please fix it."
After every single song a ad pops up and ruins the mood just really disgusting I mean i got the point of premium advantage then why keep reminding me every time just really annoyed with this and the auto play feature is also not working properly.
"I love that in order to listen to anything I need to hear an ad first but then the song/podcast just refuses to play after the ad. So I need to reboot the app, click on the sing/podcast again, listen to another ad again and then still not be able to listen to the media. Even with a premium account it would randomly decide to restart or end a 4 hour podcast or just refused to play anything. This app has quite honestly become a joke the more it has ""grown"""
"Honestly just terrible in the way most subscription services are. Extremely opaque update info, a ui (re)design that made everything far clunkier in an effort to 'streamline' experience, frustrating for free/non-premium users, clandestine efforts to push specific content, not to mention terrible pay for artists."
"Seriously sort this bloody app out Spotify!!! Every time I open it, it says 'no internet connection' your useless solution: set to offline mode; which requires an internet connection to get into the settings to do 🤦🏻‍♀️ I'm pay £10 a month for worse service than I had with the free version 🤷🏻‍♀️ Won't be for much longer unless you FINALLY listen to everyone else with the same problem and get it sorted!!!!"
"Ruined HOME screen widget by adding the secondary icon (unnecessary) & buttons are too small. Screwed up the sort option in the app. Create own Playlist and like to sort by artist or recently added, use filter but have the SHUFFLE button (which is too small) sitting on top of the PLAY button, making the filter useless. And as many different songs in Playlist - same songs have been repeating."
"Every update makes it worse. They kill intuitivity. And they seem adamant on you using your data, even if you have premium and downloaded music."
"The apps always say that i'm offline or no available connection when i'm already connected to the wifi. And i'll always have to restart the apps 2,3 times before i can finally hit the play button. Hope you guys fixed this issue"
They had FINALLY fixed the issue with the navigation bar not respecting system theme (I use dark/night theme). Latest update occurred and the ugly white nav bar is back. Disappointed such a basic UI/UX item which has been reported to Spotify support too many times by too many people over too many years is still an issue.
"Absolutely trash UI update. The library tab worked perfectly fine before, but now it is not only more complicated with no extra benefits, but also the songs don't get separated by albums on the artist's page when offline. I really hope this gets changed soon. On top of that, the playlists used to be sorted by most recently played and the artists alphabetical order. Now everything gets sorted the same way and you can't change just one. It's a mess."
"Spotify has been awesome for years until the past week or so, you app is absolutely broken, can't even see what song you're listen to because it gets stuck on the last song you played before closing the app, play/pause button doesn't work right and sometimes won't let you skip songs"
Wrong song being displayed constantly. Still plays the song I want but makes it harder to use and quite unpleasant. I really do no want to switch to Amazon music. Please fix spotify. It was like this on my s10 and now it's doing the same thing on my s21.
"App keeps stopping after ads. I don't mind ads. But when I have to shut down the app and open it again after an ad, it becomes more than a nuisance."
Why do you have to change interface. The new interface does not show songs in playlist. You have to select shuffle play only. Why do you ruin good things. Completely spolied listening experiance
I hate it because my phone before has no shuffle feature and requires premium to shut the fraking shuffle feature even downloads it is just simple to download so that is why premium is ad free Spotify! Do not beg for money because when you make money the lower your vision on us free version users your app is a no no
"Simply will not play video podcast on android. Please a commercial, let you push the play button and then it just sits there. Uninstalled reinstalled tried everything I guess I'll just uninstall it and I won't be able to listen to Joe Rogan anymore."
"So bored with the app getting worse every day, every month, every year. SD card randomly not recognised when it works with all other apps, downloads disappear, UI is horrible (and worse on desktop), can't create or organise folders on Android, can't stop downloads without changing download tag for each playlist/album/etc., accounts too easily hacked (no 2 factor authentication)... And these problems are just the tip of the iceberg. I wish Spotify cared at all about the user experience."
"The app has been great til the most recent update. Now I can't cast my music, the UI is slow and sometimes out of sync with the music. Please fix it!!!!"
"I will never use Spotify because of the geo-gatekeeping (i create a new account every time I open the app because I travel and spotify does not like me being in a different country). This is because I watch Joe Rogan. Their TV app is also worthless for me as Joe Rogen has video too (yeah, didn't you know that?) The Andoid app is way less user friendly than Youtube. It is really sad that Joe decided to quit YouTube. Such shame, Spotify has so many flaws. No ClosedCaptions/Subs, no 1.25 speed.."
"requires montly payment to download for offline, cannot select specific songs (only albums) & now found out it sometimes plays random songs when pausing twitch (even though it's been half a year since last interacted with spotify on any platform)"
"terrible interface since last major update. cannot play all of the songs saved, only shows following artists, and constantly plays same artists on shuffle. horrible update, I want to downgrade. Edit: it has now been quite some time and the problems above have now engrossed on all platforms and has worsened."
"Abysmal and disappointing. Switched for a podcast I like and as much as the music UI is trash the podcast interface is much worse. Every update makes it more difficult to navigate. I just discovered ""pins"" after months of this new UI BS and I can only have 4 pins? What am I paying money for? Library sorting is a tragedy. Needs a custom sleep timer and podcasts and music need more separation. FFS YOU ALL MAKE MORE MONEY THAN THE ARTISTS."
No longer available to skip songs using the buttons on my steering wheel or car display. I have to unlock and open my phone now. Ridiculous.
"TERRIBLE UI, near constant glitches and bugs. I regularly have to close and reopen the app just to change what's playing. Will sometimes get stuck on a playlist or podcast episode and refuse to change. Downloading and going offline works about half the time."
"I never had problems with the app before i started listening to podcasts (two weeks ago). It can't play them in order, the app takes forever to load podcasts, there are glitches and crashes... this never happenes with music. I don't mind that there is a lack of flashy algorithm perks with this feature, but the app glitching because it's poorly designed for this purpose is ridiculous. I pay for premium, i should be able to use all features to their full extent."
"New bug in the app, when I start the app and play something, and lock the screen, the music/podcast stops playing and quits the app automatically... Please fix it."
"Inconsisent login options. Spotify requires the id associated with my phone number, which was random digits and there is no option to login with registered phone number. I am literally stuck at the login screen!"
"The website and even the version for the PlayStation Store are great, and WAY better than this version. The only way you can enjoy the app is to purchase premium, which gives you the ability to do most of the things you can already do on the web player. Quite possibly the most annoying app I’ve ever used and have to keep using because no other music app works for me."
I wish I could go back to the old version. You know the one when you had premium and then there were no ads. Those days are over. That's a bummer. And then when you try to skip it you will not be able to start again... Unless you force quit and start the app again. I can tell this is on purpose. Not a glitch. What happened to you Spotify?
Do not pay for premium - this app has too many bugs and has gradually deteriorated. It has gotten worse over the years and the last 6+ months have been awful. Rarely works fluidly
"Keeps dropping out. Freezes. Ads ruin the stream and stops it playing. I was hopeful for this to play podcasts, but its not what it should be."
"Literally ruined, the new layout is so confused and overall terrible, they added recommended songs in playlists that I did not like and had no control over. Uninstalling this app"
"0 stars.Ver 8.6.30.889 is now unusable. I have now cancelled premium account. Playlists have disappeared etc. In 2019 the UI went backward as you no longer can view saved songs by artist & album forcing you to create playlists. In May 2021 the default library list now includes everything with no way of keeping playlists together. No way of defaulting startup screen to ""playlists"" only, has only 4 pins & no sort order to keep playlists together."
"If you use the free version of Spotify, they tell you that you will get 30 minutes ad-free if you click a ""Watch Now"" button (which actually plays 3 or 4 commercials instead of one), but then you get another commercial in about 10 minutes. I don't care so much about the commercials, but don't lie to me. Whatever you do, don't lie to me."
"Used to be great now takes forever to load trying to check something online which shouldn't be necessary since it's a paid subscription. Quite frustrating, love the platform but thinking seriously about changing."
"Freezes frequently recently, the music will continue to play but all the buttons stop working (skip, back, pause, volume) both inside the app itself and the widget. Can't get it to close unless I use force stop. OS will eventually say the app isn't working and to force close even while music continues to play. Samsung A10 fully updated OS and app."
"This used to be my favorite app. Key word: USED to be. The App is no longer smooth or functional anymore: it is a shame that a once great user experience is gone - replaced by constant glitches, horrible optimization, and 'pretty cosmetics'. Brief Summary: Not much has changed for the better in over a year - so I have committed to gradually de-Spotifying my music library, and leaving this Spoti-train bound for the eventually catastrophic wreck. P.S. (premium user)"
They ruined the app. They play way too many songs that I never put on my playlist. I can't even skip songs or select the songs I want to hear from my playlist.
"Uninterested in signing up for Premium (paid) membership because not all music titles are included in the catalog. Overall, the UI is good. Intrusive Ads after every 4-music titles, with no option to skip, is a big thumbs down as it ruins the listening experience! So, uninstalling.. :-P"
Why should I keep using this app while YouTube has no skip limitations? Poor business decision. They could earn piles of money from free users by advertising just like YouTube and there would be no need to limit and irritate your user. Also new web ui sucks. Once I was a heavy spotify user but one day I just woke up and noticed that I didn't even installed it on my new phone! It's interesting how unconsciously YouTube made me switch my favorite music app.
"I don't know how but music start playing automatically without even taping the play button, plus watch this add to get 30 minutes of uninterrupted music is not working, after evey 2-3 song a add is coming, kindly do something 😑😑"
"This app is bad, It used to be good until the update. When i try to play an song it wont play it, When i press the green play button on liked songs it plays an rabdom song i dont even have in my liked song, Please fix this."
"Done with spotify. Tried to listen to JRE. After 5-6 long ads the podcast wont play. Searched spotify for solutions. Removed and installed again. Created new account! Same thing. Worse than Microsoft. If you can't make an effortless user experience, i am not wasting my time searching for solutions. Even JRE is not enough motivation."
The latest update on Android is terrible. Navigation is unintuitive and clunky. Downloaded content is essentially useless when you're offline because it won't load. I tried to persist hoping it would get better but it hasn't. Worth considering a different music streaming service.
"I have been using spotify for quite long and since the last two updates,whenever i want to play some kind of songs,it doesn't show up and even takes longer time to play a song...Too frustrating"
"Updates to the app often cause problems, like I just updated today and now when I'm connected to Android Auto in my car, the app no longer responds to Bluetooth commands (which is how my stereo buttons are mapped to AA). This is the second time in the last year that this same bug has occurred; it took over a month before it was fixed the last time. In the future I may just disable updates."
"Genuinely amazing how such a large company manages to consistently publish such a terrible, broken app. I've been a premium user for about a decade and in 10 years, the app had been barely functional at best. They seem to be in a cycle of breaking something whiling fixing something else, then fixing the broken part but breaking the other part in the process. A month ago, smart speaker integration was busted. Then they fixed it. Now its busted again. This literally never ends."
"When connected to car, autoplays every time even though I have closed and attempted to sop many times, and turned cat mode off. Also very hard to navigate and use UI, queues, etc."
"June 2021: i hate the new layout! Why in the world would anybody want all of their playlists, artists, and albums in one giant list instead of just in the normal tabs Its an extra click to get to the information everyone wants, except now you can't even sort playlists differently (e.g. recently added) from artists (e.g. alphabetical) Who thinks this is good design? It's not innovative, it doesn't help anyone do more of what they want with the softwares I'll be trying out Deezer shortly"
"You only get 6 skips per hour which is a ridiculous rule. Also I can't even play specific songs from my own playlist which just ruins my experience. Please change this, these features shouldn't be a perk in premium."
Fix it already 3rd update with no fix. How can yall expect someone to pay for this...i almost started the 3 month trial but i cant even listn to 1 podcast without it freezing and messing my phone up.*update* 4th update instaled and its still janky... Keeps lagging and jumping around while i try to scroll Also they have ruined the headphone controlls for podcasts...now u have to open your phone and click skip 15 sec cause your headphones will jist skip the rest of the podcast and start a new one
"This is a bad app. As I write this review, music which I put on several minutes ago is playing, even though I quit the app. It deletes my downloads and doesn't open. This is not great for a service that is bought. The non-premium version is not worth it either, so many ads and you can't choose your music. However, I have to stay with spotify because I depend too heavily on the playlists I have made and can't let them go. Don't get this app. Don't let them trap you."
"The app is incredibly buggy. Downloads often don't work, I need internet to even get to my downloads which makes no sense. The redesigned My Library part is very chaotic and confusing. Songs or podcasts just stop sometimes and I have to restart the app. I deleted and reinstalled the app two times, no improvement. I used to like Spotify and was happy to pay for it, but I don't enjoy using it anymore. If they don't improve the app soon, I'll switch to another one."
I once had this as 5⭐ Updates in the last 8 months have completely changed and ruined this app. It's awful and I am looking into alternatives to switch over to for streaming. Probably Apple Music.
"The Spotify/Mobile App is a nightmare of poor design. Just search for users who simply want to a play an album in the order it is in, and you will find hundreds if not thousands of complaints going back years. One huge button that says, ""Shuffle Play"" and no intuitive way to play it in order. What's worse is even if you do know to click the first song in the list, it still does not work if you still songs queued as it reverts to shuffle after the first song. As an IT professional of 35 years' experience, including UI design, this is simply unacceptable. Many answers give workarounds such as ""go to Desktop app"" ... guess what, not everyone has a Desktop app, and giving users ""workarounds"" for a years old issue is NOT a solution."
I used to love spotify alot...But now the advertisement has ruined it all.. After Every 2 song there is break.. The app has become the worst.. Now I hate it the most.. Let people at least listen a little song.. We are to here for your stupid brk .. There should be brk but after atleast 10 songs
"This app is guaranteed to crash multiple times a day. I used to love this app but it has gone downhill so quickly. Ever since acquiring the JRE, Spotify has ruined not only itself but the JRE. If I listen to a podcast, it will stop and force me to start all over without knowing where I was. Makes md not want to listen anymore. Please fix this."
"Just had 7 ad rolls before I quit the app, pretty sure they would have just kept coming. I was just trying to listen to a new song an artist post on Facebook. Didn't even get to hear it. Thanks Spotify!"
"I've been using an old version of spotify since they switched to this trash version that removed the previously played list, allowed individual song saving, and completely obliterated the way I found mymusic. After a couple years I wanted to see what this ridiculous ""that's so you"" list was about. Of course its ""omg you PLAYED X.. AFTER Y?! THATS SO YOU"". Total joke. The ui has only gotten worse. They're lucky I use an os that allows me to revert otherwise I'd cancel this garbage. Change it back"
"Won't load your library if you have a slight connection and downloaded songs. You need to disable wifi and 4g just to load the offline library or worse switch into offline mode and not be able to stream at all. The response to this issue was to try to reinstall the app and all 35 gigs of downloaded music. Just, have you tried reinstalling? Every update since 2017 seems to make the ui worse and the only reason to stay is the decent radio whic has gone downhill too."
"After latest update the app is constantly losing connection, freezing or crashing. The changes to the UI are unintuitive and make it harder to find my albums and shows. Spotify used to be incredible, it's time to ditch premium and find a better music service."
Used to be a 5 star app but new update has stopped it working totally. A real shame as I will be cancelling premium service because there is no service available at the moment. Also will be demanding the fees paid since update are returned under consumer rights as they are failing to provide their side of the contractual agreement of service. I suggest everyone else does the same and maybe they will review their updates before ruining the service for users in future.
"It was a really nice apps for listening music, but recently there're some issues on it. No internet connection available message keeps popping out and loading continuously, and it will quit automatically when I wanted to play music. The same problems appear even after the update. Please help to fix it as soon as possible.Thanks"
"Recent update ruined this app for me. Used to love this app. But after the update, it constantly freezes, doesn't connect to internet, will randomly close out, etc. After seeing all the other reviews, I'm curious why they aren't taking any action regarding this?"
"Endlessly frustrating. Glitches. App is slow to load. 80% of the time, when I open the app and want to search or browse, it does not work. Wheel of doom. Says I have no Internet connection when I do. Why can't I view all my downloaded playlists / podcasts quickly without the dreaded wheel of loading / ""no Internet connection""? Why do I have to click ""remove download"" AND ""remove from my episodes"" for every played podcast? I have paid premium for years and the app is now awful. Fuming"
"Because of this new update I'll probably be deleting this app for now until y'all fix this new update, you guys took all our privilege to listen to music freely, it's like we can just listen on what you guys serve,my playlist just starts with shuffle, you guys removed the repeat, shuffle and loop button, then put it into the premium for money, I'd rather stop getting forced to listen to my songs shuffled than to pay for that minor of a thing, free accounts don't have privileges anymore,fix this."
"Absolutely horrible. It forces you to listen to “suggested songs” and you cannot skip them without buying Premium. You also can’t replay the song without fully making it through. It has gotten really annoying. Uninstalling.. The new update ruined the app, I don’t reccomend downloading it at all."
"Poor reliability, ever changing UI that only gets worse as the years go by. Once they remove the social features I'll just switch to YT Music."
"Premium user. Poco X3 NFC MIUI global 12.0.8 Relatively new android phone but app is constantly freezing, on start, usually slow, sluggish and unresponsive. No internet connection available message appears on WiFi, 4G and while other apps have verifiable connection."
"There's only 2 things that annoy me alot more then ""Tadpoles lullaby"" in Spotify. 1. When I watch my ""30 minutes of free music"" ad, it plays another ad when the 30 minutes start. And that takes up some time, 2. The listener/watcher should be able to pick if Spotify should add random songs to the playlist, say a kid has it and creates a Playlist with baby shark then it could get ruined w/ a song w/ curse words. Maybe they could download Spotify kids but it can happen w/ a song they don't like."
"Messed up the UI! Use this app daily, but the new user interface is a major step back in terms of ease of use. Really surprised at this poor new layout."
"Doesn't let me play the songs I want to play. (I press the ""play"" button, and it only gives a short clip of the music before stopping. That's it.) Really frustrating as I can't listen to music."
"Where do I start? I know, any time spotify is open I get PLAGUED with ""failed to download mms msg"" even post recent update. What else? Oh I know... 30 mins free isn't 30 mins.more like 20-25. And if you hit no, welp just swap to yt for the incoming 3 ads and 2 spotify people attempting to be funny and or ""relatable"" Had songs interrupted for ads that weren't even ads, just a condescending spotify voice over guy complaining I listen to explicit music. Remove it, it's not funny nor quirky."
"Most recent update is a massive disaster. The interface barely works. I don't see a reason why my phone should be struggling with a simple music streaming app. I am actually looking to try to restore the previous version. It isn't a small inconvenience, it fundementally damages the user experience. Hopefully spotify can undo this blunder."
06/12/21- This new UI is AWFUL. I hate this new homescreen. It's incredibly inconvenient and clunky. I want the lists back. I want to easily scroll through options and recommendations.
Worst app ever! UI is good but the adds are unbearable. Adds does not include anything other than telling you to buy premium. So to stop adds about premium you should buy premium and these are so frequent you feeling like you are listening to adds and songs are playing in the middle. The sound quality is reduced without premium.
"First they ruin the library an now they ruin the home screen. Seriously, who thought screen wide blocks was a good idea? And it's not even categorized anymore, just a randomly ordered list of playlists, made for you, podcasts, other recommendations etc. Awful. Garbage. Only reason I'm staying is that it only costs me €2.50/month thanks to family subscription. And they're cutting it close. This awful app is not worth the full price. I don't understand why they insist on downgrading their product."
"Lots of really bad updates the past few months. This newest one redesigning the home page is the worst, it just makes the home page ugly and more annoying to use. Most of the apps features have just been getting less intuitive for awhile and whoevers leading this direction should be fired."
New UI isn't helpful I like how the old interface would show podcast that were similar that you may like or show playlist and artists that were also similar. New interface does not show previous played up top of screen like old interface Spotify please switch back!
The home page of this app gets progressively unintuitive the more they update it. It's like they update the UI with the goal of pushing you off the app. Recommend trying another service first
"New update has ruined Spotify for me. Moved everything from the home screen and now just shows me things it thinks I'm Interested and it's so very wrong. Worst update ever, very poor experience, won't be renewing premium."
I really hate the new home page and it's ruined my experience. It was great when I got to see multiple choices under each recommended category. Whose idea was it to change that to one single recommendation inside an ugly box? Oh yeah also half the time the app is too dumb to detect my internet is in fact on and I have to keep closing it a bunch of times to get it to realise.
Well spotify.. youre back to 1 star.. I dont understand why you implement a cool system like adding pins to your favorite albums.. but what kind of brain dead logic tells the software developers to limit the amount to 4.. 4 pins.. when I want to pin the 8 different generas I have to the top because I'm sick of searching for them constantly.. im sick of these illogical design choices is well funded corporations.. could you not hire a better developer?
"Ive used Spotify forever and recently it has been so buggy! ""No internet connection"" when I have stable internet, it constantly stops playing because ""something went wrong"", it will randomly lock up and won't display what I'm actually listening to. Very quickly not being worth the subscription price"
"Just don't get it. Simple. ""Listen to all your favorite songs for free"" but if you dont buy premium you have to sit through 10 ads and 14 other songs you dont care about, only to listen to 10 more ""suggested songs"" before MAYBE youll get the song you want. Like i genuinely just started up my ps4 so i can ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE SONG I WANT ON LOOP WITH MAYBE 2-3 ADS EVERY 30 MINUTES. Take inspiration from what Sony did with your service, and make spotify more broke-bitsh friendly."
"If i've rated soo poorly for this app that's cause of the adds that just ruins the whole experience of app itself. No, it's seriously too much, to the point where Spotify is just doing it just for the sake of getting more premium membership. I wish i could rate zero stars. What all Spotify is good for is for its annoying adds."
"A little over a year later and I use this app at least 70% of my waking day. If I had the time I would use it possibly more. Deep gratitude for providing such an easy, intuitive way to access music. Update: it's June 2021 and I've dropped the 5 stars down to 1. I'm a premium user. We were guaranteed no ads. Now podcasts have ads. What a joke"
"Its been a mess, servers down and slow all the time, the app cant allow me to acces quickly my offline library, it depends all the time on their slow and unstable servers, when switching audio from devices it lasts longer then if i go manually and press play on the certain device(of course setting it offline before because it does not allow you to play cuz the servers are unresponsive) Im still waiting for the HD service cuz it sounds really bad and dimmed."
"Does many things well, but unfortunately I can never take advantage of them because I just get a message saying no internetconnection available. It's bad enough not being able to play downloaded content when I genuinely am offline (what on earth is the point of being able to download it then?) but to be told I can't do it because no connection is available even when I am connected takes the cake. Fed up with the constant 'improvements' that just make it harder to use. Will uninstall soon."
"Nothing about the Spotify Premium on Android 10, UI 2.5 has worked well in several months. Approximately 20 times uninstalling / reinstalling clearing the cache, plenty of free space, plenty of RAM, superb throughput 300 Mbps download & upload speed, all app updates on board, no apps installed from outside of the Play store, all Samsung updates, same. A few hours dedicated to tech support in chat with Samsung. Spotify's resolve includes their notification of engineering dept, wait for updates"
I've been a premium member for few years now and have always loved it until now. The new update is horrible. My songs that I play from my Playlist keep switching to other random songs I've never heard of and as soon as I switch it back it switches back to something else I would never listen to. Whenever I'm not playing Russian roulette with the songs it constantly pauses anf glitches the songs I am listening to. Hopefully they can fix it quick or I am unsubscribing
"This app hasn't worked in weeks. It's unresponsive, slow and has a real issue showing me what is actually downloaded on my phone. I don't understand why they put so much money into buying podcasts just to make the UI impossible to find podcasts?? 😂"
No internet connection when I'm clearly connected to Wi-Fi and or 4G service has become a nuisance. When connecting support and being told to uninstall the app multiple times is also a nuisance.
In this app i cant listen 2 songs properly. This app contain so much irritating types of ads and its algorithm does not allow you to listen minimum 2 songs properly. This app ruin my listening experuence.
"Spotify decides at random points in my Playlist to play random songs. It completely ruins the experience. You also can't click on individual songs, you have to listen to your entire Playlist just to get to 1 song, and if it's the last song of your Playlist, it'll start playing random songs"
"They ruined the whole app. I hate shuffle play and now I can't just play what I want, they also added a stupid and pointless feature in which Spotify adds songs to your playlist of their choosing automatically. That's cool and all but for example when you have a playlist full of Feeder songs and the songs automatically chosen are not related then it's annoying and I would rather choose what songs go where not Spotify. They've also gone ham with ad placement and the absurd repetition of said ads"
"Every time i finish a podcast episode, the next episode in the queue is the previous episode (one that i have already listen to). I don't see any option to reverse this queue sequence and it really don't make sense to play the previous episode. Really terrible UX design."
"Used spotify for years, but since this last update the app is almost unusable. It's been weeks now, and the issues still haven't been fixed. The player doesn't update to show what is currently playing, but rather shows the cover and title of a podcast I listened to weeks ago. It plays the song, but shows this podcast as being what is playing, on minute - 306 or whatever bc it just keeps going. It doesn't respond correctly on the pause/play button either, or it shows the opposite of what.Fix it."
"Recent updates have introduced severe bugs, including: - music continuing to play after pause button pressed on Bluetooth headphones (other music/audio apps still work correctly) - failure to sync between android app and windows/macos Spotify apps - inability to open the queue on the android app (this is especially bad in combination with the recent changes to the queue on the desktop app) - now and again the queue is emptied without warning The app is no longer fit for purpose."
"The Play button for podcasts is not working for me most of the times , don't understand what is wrong with the app. Very bad experience."
"Incredibly frustrating, new UI sucks and app constantly crashes. Customer support is absolutely atrocious, absurdly difficult to work with and very slow"
"Latest version is complete rubbish. Randomly stops, the UI doesn't update when you change song, and the bloody ""car view"" completely breaks the video of podcasts, resulting in a black screen after you switch ""car view"" off. Please roll back to the previous version!"
Despise new UI update is trash and makes me wish there were an actual competitor would rate higher but inexplicable long loading in menus regardless of signal strength or speed
"Since a while the app is buggy. Not connecting to Bluetooth speakers properly, not showing the song/podcast you're playing and quiting every 30 min."
Spotify : Why don't you tell us what your updates do like every other app in the play store. Its lazy and patronizing to tell me I should just leave all updates on for every app just because of spotify. The phone app is still buggy as it was 5 years ago. But the final straw is that The scam company just put up prices and took the money without consent. Awful awful company. Glad its loosing millions. Hope it goes bust. Switch to Deezer. It has proper lyrics built in.
App was great but last update ruined it. Icons and tracks regularly don't load. Interface is unintuitive. Scrolling through podcasts is bugged. Playlists don't display in playlist folders. App freezes and crashes. How can an industry titan like Spotify ruin their perfectly fine app in one update like this? Where's your QA?
I don't know what happened or if it was a recent update but it completely ruined the app. The timer will be stuck on 1:48 even though the content you are listening to is still going. When you disconnect Bluetooth the music/podcast keeps playing. It will show that you are listening to one song but in reality you are listening to another. Really disappointed because Spotify was so amazing for all these years and an update ruined it. Please fix these issues asap otherwise users will find other apps
Last update has ruined the app. Songs will just randomly stop. I don't have the ability to pause. The list goes on.
"I'm a FedEx driver and I listen to podcast as I work. They updated this to now you can pause anything you listen to on your phone. I will literally be listening then I try to pause it with my ear bud - won't work, I swipe down on my phone for quick display try to pause - won't work, I even go into the app and the little bar at the bottom that LITERALLY has a pause button guess what - WON'T WORK! I literally have to stop everything and tap on what I'm listening to and pause it just to stop it."
"well, time to cancel the sub to this GODAWFUL service, how the board or whoever allows them to make these ""updates"" let's them ambitiously attempt to make the worst streaming platform available, I don't know;- The same issues as everyone else, the UI does not work any more. Endless bugs, you don't even have hope for it working, but seeing new bugs constantly is interesting, like I wonder which bug I'll get today. it's unreal that they can charge for this"
I don't like the new update. It ruins my whole collection. It is better when alphabetized because it's easy to locate the albums I want to listen to... ☹️☹️
"terrible platform. this new update ruined the convenient interface. Spotify steals your money. i pay for premium and still get ads, I've contacted developers multiple times about it and haven't heard back for 6 months straight. cancelled my subscription finally, on top of all that I'm getting five ads back to back every 20 minutes which is just annoying. I'll be calmly listening to my 90's punk music and suddenly I hear DO YOU WANT OUR YOGURT? BBGO YOGURT IS THE HEALTHIEST YOGURT EVER. YOGURT."
Might be the worst app I've ever used. If I could rate it negative five (-5) stars I would. Only using it to listen to Rogan and is the WORST podcast experience. How can a company as large as Spotify not figure out what a single developer or developers do with any of the other fantastic podcast apps out there. It shows that it is all about money and be damned what the user experience is.
Each update removes functionality and practicality and introduces new bugs. With the last update playlists in folders disappear when downloaded. I've been a premium user for about a decade now but I'm seriously consider switching to another service as one of the last updated also ruined podcasts.
"Last update completely ruined listening podcasts for me!App stops and freezes and shutting it down doesn't resolve a problem - only force stop via setting does, but only until the next time you play a podcast."
The latest update ruined the experience. The GUI can't recognize when I've started playing something new. Especially problematic with podcast episodes
Whew. The new update ruined app functionality. Can't play even downloaded playlist or podcasts even in offline mode. This is super frustrating for me because my phone signal cannot connect at my work place so I have to rely on offline mode. So I can no longer listen to anything while I work.
"Podcasts stop randomly, progress bar stops but audio is still playing, currently playing box doesn't update, play/pause button doesn't work all the time. UI prior to update was superior. Big step backwards with the latest update. Same issues on multiple devices, on wifi or cellular network."
"What happened after the update? I walk out of my car and my phone continues playing my podcasts. And when I reconnect to my car or even just play straight from my phone, the song display is frozen and doesn't even match the item currently playing. The stop and play button sometimes doesn't respond. A forced app close doesn't fix the issue. Please revert back to the previous version before the latest update. I want my seamless 'premium' music stream back! Thank you!"
The app keeps stopping. A few times an hour I have to pull out my phone and press the play button. I will be listening to one podcast but the player shows the last podcast I listened too.
Where is the pause button and the sleep timer? Since the update they have disappeared! There's just Play button Can't forward or go back either. Not impressed at all!!!!
"I've been using spotify premium for a long time, and since this last update I've been having a whole bunch of UI issues - wrong songs appearing on the listening tab, not being able to change position within a track, songs within playlists getting scrambled.. The content on the app is still great, but the latest issues made the app practically unusable..."
"This app works great, but for some reason, when I'm playing my liked songs, they decide to stick random songs that should not be there in the mix. Also when I'm running, a minute and a half of ads at a time ruins my flow."
"Would be nice if the app would not mess up and show me what song I'm actually listening to, or show the correct pause/play button. Have to shut the app down 3 times a day at least now, get this fixed"
"This app used to be rock solid, but recent versions require constant restarting to get the right podcast to actually play. I'm on a pretty new high end phone too."
"The music/podcast plays, but the play bar does not move or change. This makes it impossible to scrub or skip through. The playback stops entirely sometimes requiring restart, thw playbar issue persists through this. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling same issue. Have seen others complain about the same thing online, clearly Spotify cannot expend the manpower to fix this and as such will stop using the app as it is useless in its current state"
"Recent update completely ruined app. Repeated unwanted playing and pausing of songs and podcasts, followed by constant crashes and the 'now playing' screen not updating dynamically makes it impossible to listen to any media longer than 3 or 4 minutes. Don't bother with a download or subscription until this is fixed."
"Ever since the recent update I've been having trouble easily locating my playlists on the phone app. Having to constantly sort with the new buttons just to get to my custom order is already annoying enough, but sometimes none of my playlists show at all. Some older playlists also don't show up in folders and only recent playlists do, yet they show up on the Recently Played on the Home tab. I am a Premium user and shouldn't have to be worried my playlists were deleted. Worst update ever."
"I am a premium user and for the past week or so this app has been randomly stopping. So every few minutes I have open the app back up and press the play button. Not only that, but also the play button doesn't show that anything is playing. It often shows the wrong the podcast/song. It is very frustrating. Edit: I have Uninstalled and reinstalled several times now, but its only a temporary fix each time. I'm going to end up canceling my subscription if this doesn't get fixed here soon."
"Latest update ruined my opinion of spotify. It keeps telling me i have no internet connection. Please fix it. I am really considering going over to youtube premium. From randomly stopping my song to this no internet saga, i think it is a bit much."
"Unusable, used to be fine now rubbish. Freezes, won't access buttons to control media, doesn't change tracks or display the correct information for what is being listened to."
"Please fix the app. I have premium and my app is completely glitchy. Everytime I press a new song, it is not updating which is the current track. Play button is not working correctly, sometimes it does not work. Furthermore, I do not totally understand why podcasts have ads when I have premium? Please fix this."
"Recently it pauses itself constantly. Pause/play button, progress bar, and podcast episode don't display properly. Trouble connecting to car stereo using Android auto. I have cleared data, reinstalled, and toggled off battery optimizing several times, to no avail. Very irritating."
"I'll select a song, it'll play a different song. I'll pause, it won't pause but will say it has paused. I'll scroll through podcast episodes, it reverse the order of episodes and jumps to a random episode. I'll have a song/podcast playing, it will decide to just stop until I open the app again. I'll press the jump 15 seconds button, it'll will start the podcast over again. This app is barely functional."
"5/25 update ruined it for me. Podcasts skip to a new episode while listening, doesn't save play progress, and crashing when ads try to pop up. Going back to stitcher 👋"
"The new update makes the app unusable. It randomly starts playing after i make phone calls, when i click on a song, the song starts playing but the app displays a podcast i listened to earlier, the play/pause button does not update. It is horrible. Please fix this, the old version was so much better."
"The new update is buggy as hell. I have to reinstall the app every few days because it stops responding and just gets stuck. Tracks stop playing on their own, bluetooth headphone buttons don't work anymore, the app doesn't show up on lock screen. The new library also sucks so much, it's become impossible to find any podcast episodes I hadn't finished listening and want to pick up again. I'm now actively looking for an alternative for this incredibly expensive ""premium"" app."
"The latest update has ruined Spotify. Failure to play songs and podcasts, becoming stuck on the wrong song stated as playing, and the entire app just crashing sporadically."
Almost unusable with how frustrating it is to use now since one of the latest updates. Everything keeps freezing and all the folders/buttons for things keep disappearing.
"Major malfunctions recently. Stops abruptly, won't respond to commands, shuffles the same 3 songs on a 50 song Playlist, play one thing while displaying another. The last update ruined this app."
"I know it's only one podcast, but Spotify really ruined the viewing and listening experience of JRE. Amazing that I still can't consistently pick up where I left off, reliably play video, or other extremely basic media player capabilities. Laughable, even. =("
"I have a premium account but the app has become buggy after the last update and it now requires extra steps to download and remove podcasts from my library. I can't simply just remove a podcast from my library, all downloaded podcasts are moved to my Your Episodes list and i now have to both remove the download from my library and from my Your Episodes list. It also freezes or doesn't show the correct currently playing podcast. So infuriating!"
Facing this podcast issue Tye changes in podcasts or songs does not get reflected after listening to a podcast on Spotify app. I use the paid version man and for the people who talk about user convience and user experience in their product story this bug is a pain.
"I was a happily paying user for a long time a LOVED it. I quit my subscription several months ago after the app started taking so long to load when I got in my car that I was already at my destination LING before my library came up. Tried all kinds of things to clean up my phone etc. Even reinstalled the app. Ive tried reinstalling over the past few monts, while paying to use a comoetitors app, hoping the issues were fixed and so far they are not."
The app layout is alright think needs a major redesign. Also add in a white colour theme for those who don't want dark theme. Also your app is horrible when it suggests something or play lists of songs I have already downloaded or added into a play list suggests the same songs. Of a rating out of 10 being good I rate this app 1 have deleted and switched to apple music which is better and also has songs Spotify doesn't have
"Previously rated five stars, and Spotify is still really good, when it works. The newest update has caused numerous issues for me. The apps UI will freeze frequently, and occasionally it won't fully freeze, but won't show the currently playing song.If it is helpful, I'm currently using a Pixel 5."
"Fix the bloody app lads. It wasn't broken before but its maddening to be on a run and have things skip all over the place, or not play at all, for no apparent reason. Its clearly a common problem judging by other reviews here,and especially aggravating in line with the horrendous new UI. I didn't think they could make it worse, but sweet jesus, its awful!"
Keeps freezing on a podcast/song and can't rewind/skip/play/pause my current song....not to mention the awful new UI. Please fix
"Most recent update has completely ruined the app. Songs and podcasts stop constantly and are incorrectly displayed for no reason, even after restarting several times and reinstalling"
"The whole point of Spotify is to listen to music I like, however, without premium I can only play the radio stations that the songs I like are featured on. If I make a playlist of songs and start the playlist, chances are it'll play a bunch of songs that aren't on my playlist at all. Ruined"
"After the recent update all my spotify app stopped working. Every single action I do the app will only show a loading circle icon. Searching anything? Loading. Open New Release feature? Loading. Open any other playlist other than my downloadedt one? Loading. Playing MY DOWNLOADED SONG?? FREEZE. Just never ending loading and freeze in android, windows, and freaking linux. Literally unusable. Considering to cancel my premium subscription."
"App keeps crashing, it's not showing up in the notification bar when I'm listening to podcasts. I can't stop or resume playing, all I can do is close the app altogether. Also the library update is not very user friendly, it's quite a mess.."
"This is insanity, gone from taking ages to load something, to not loading at all. What's the point in a toilet that won't flush? I'm genuinely disappointed. Why has nothing been done yet? Are they even trying to resolve these issues? Make Spotify great again?! 🤣"
The ap is always asking me to listen to an ad for 30 min of ad free listening. Sounds like a fair shake until the app only plays one song and then stops on its own... not quite 30 min.
"Pauses, freezes, to no end! I'm glad I read the ratings bc I thought I was going crazy. the app with stop playing music or podcasts randomly, freeze and get stuck on a podcast o listened to previously. the >> buttons jump you to different times in the podcast or song. PLEASE FIX THIS!!"
If I go on my playlist or my liked songs it just doesn't work when I press play on a song it just plays a random song that I've never heard of and it used to be so easy to use and so much better but it's just been ruined
Premium user for years and was hopeful the latest update would fix the numerous issues as reported by other users but unfortunately after updating and reinstalling the issues are still present :( Play/pause button stuck on first track; only get a couple songs before player stops completely and I have to physically open the app to play music (but the cover of first track still stuck so I can't see what's currently playing. My experience seems to be isolated to mobile device so far. PLEASE FIX :(
Horrible experiences recently. The song playing isn't the one shown as playing. Instead it says I'm hundreds of minutes into a podcast I played last night. Actually awful. Happens multiple times every day now and leaves me not wanting to listen to anything on the app. Might look into Deezer or any other similar player. Ridiculously poor experience that has obviously been happening for quite some time but Spotify don't seem to care.
"The latest update is just a concoction of bugs (irregular app shut downs/pauses, frozen play/pause button, doesn't show the current thing is playing but freezez on the first thing you listen to, etc) that makes the app extremely vexing and unusable at the moment. The new library design is also by no means better than the design of previous versions so I really don't see why developers chose to worsen the layout, the functions and make the app completely user-hostile."
"I got fed up with YouTube music and bought Spotify. Spotify is even worse, I left YouTube music because I can't save my autogenerated playlists. Here I can't even get autogenerated playlists. I don't want to go find some song, I want a couple recommended playlist options and to select one, Spotify wants me to spend a huge amount of time building custom playlist and stuff, that's insane. I don't have time for that, keep track of songs I like, and play me music I want don't make me work."
I am paying for premium however I have not been able to like songs for the past 2 months to add to the constant stoppages in the middle of tracks. Please sort this out spotify or you will lose me as a customer. Have updated the app and now it crashes mid song requiring to close and restart the app. 🙄
Piece of shat. Shatify is always having issues with internet and wth is up with the volume?!? It's like muddled and when you pause you hear the OG volume setting for a split second. What's the point of using a service that makes sue it ruins your experience?
New update is AWFUL!!!! Nothing is working properly. I can't scroll through a podcast list without it jumping around. The sort button is broken. It keeps skipping around songs and freezing. Please for the love if God and my sanity... FIX THIS SPOTIFY!!!!!!!!! I am a paying patron and if this isn't fixed soon I want my money back!
"Latest update is complete garbage. Keeps pausing music randomly, crashes, tells me I'm offline while connected to wifi, scrolling through songs doesn't work, pushing the 15 sec button on podcasts just restarts the podcast. It has become a pain in the neck just to listen to music on an app that I pay monthly for."
Idk why but recently it's just playing random songs that aren't even in my playlist? After every update it just keeps getting worse and its quite annoying so I suggest not downloading it. Fix the flipping app 💀
"Good service but the app is very buggy. Finding podcast are hard even though I follow them. The app keeps randomly stopping. The progress bar stops moving while the podcast moves on, making it impossible to skip ahead or back without losing your spot. Overall UI is confusing."
"New updates ruined it! I can't see what I'm listening to, and if I try to skip forward/back 15 seconds it will start from the beginning, music/podcasts stop randomly despite having internet connection, and it will tell me I don't have an internet connection when I do. So unreliable!"
"Terrible experience since last update. Like many others, I pay for a premium service and have a broken app. Menu bar freezes on a track that was played in the past. Tracks stop for no reason. Closing app doesn't solve it. Force stopping doesn't solve it. Uninstalled and reinstalled also does not solve it. Revert to a previous build or update and fix this. If not done soon, I'll find a new music app and demand a refund for this garbage I'm paying for."
"UI-Clean UI No option to dislike songs, Same irritating songs are repeated in every playlist I am finding it difficult to keep selecting and removing songs each time I play a playlist. Region based songs are mixed, Many playlists contains songs from different regions. As a user I would expect recommendations based on my interest and language preferences, But I am expected to listen to songs based on your preferences which I am not able to accept as a premium user."
"As with everyone else who has left 1 star reviews recently, the latest update causes random freezes. The 'now playing' window breaks and a device restart is required to get it running. Not only that, Spotify takes an age to open up downloaded songs if your connection is slow. Come on Spotify, sort it out!"
"New update has ruined the app. Downloaded content to play offline- now need internet to play. All music, podcasts, artists etc is moved into 1 list making it harder to navigate. App like to shut off regularly in the middle if using it. What's the point of paying for premium when the quality is dropping? I've been a premium member for years, with the offline mode being what I mainly want it for. Now I download it to listen offline, but it won't play past a few seconds without internet."
"The update is buggy. The playback strip at the bottom fails to update and so does not correspond to what is actually playing. And no, a 'quick' reinstall - three in fact - didn't work, and failed to find my data. Uninstalling and moving on. Lucky I didn't upgrade to premium"
"Anyone else having an issue with this being complete garbage? It crashes about every 30 seconds, pauses for no reason. Says its playing one podcast but its actually another. Play and pause button seems to be frozen and even if I close the app it still says its playing."
"Love Spotify, but they refuse to add an option to make 'explicit' (read original) versions of songs the standard (restrict ruined radio edits) even though the community routinely asks for it, and they have a toggle for the opposite. As a non parent and music lover, this single handedly is sending me to literally any other music player."
"Last update ruined the app for me, in podcast categories the true crime is basically empty only shows 4 shows,so now you don't see anything newly available and to find something you have to search through other categories or specifically type in what your looking for into the search,also have problems with the app freezing,not playing stuff,not being able to switch track etc."
"Worst experience. I couldn't even search a song. Whenever the search button is pressed, it starrs showing ""No internet connection"" and this is when there IS high speed network connection. Even though it shows ""No internet connection"", it resumes the previous song and even the liked songs."
The latest update is very unreliable. It starts playing when I disconnect from Bluetooth which is annoying when I get out of the car and have to kill the app. The recent UI change is terrible for getting to what you want in your library.
"Love Spotify but this new update is awful. Won't show what's currently playing, can't pause or skip or quite literally do anything. The only way to stop what I have playing is to close the app completely. This needs to be addressed by Spotify very soon, its been a week and I'm almost ready to go back to Pandora 🤮"
Literally unistalling this. You've totally ruined the user interface with these updates. Why have you made it harder to use. Do you want less subscribers because your going the right way about it. Why am I suddenly following a bunch of artists because i may have listened to a song once. Why am I following any artists? shouldn't I be able to decide if I want to follow someone?!. why am i now not able to delete playlist without just touching it?. Seriously pissed and removing this off my phone.
"The new version has so many issues. Can't stop and start from the bar in the notifications, it doesn't accurately show what is playing in the bar either. Same thing with currently playing in the app. Thats it for bugs but the redesign has made the podcast section unusable. I can't just see a list of my downloaded podcasts which is a terrible redesign. If this doesn't go back I will be cancelling premium."
"Been a premium user for four years but user experience just went from excellent to really bad. The app keeps on freezing. It just stops playing the music, trouble connecting to network, doesn't show the artists that I follow, unfollows and unlikes artists and music that I followed and liked, and the list goes on."
"The only podcast I've ever listened to is Rhett and Link Ear Biscuits- a family friendly show! but suddenly my home page recommended are all obscene things like pornographic shows, white supremacists and other disgusting content- No ability to remove, report or change the recommendations. Still no Chromecast casting as of 5/2021 APP CONSTANTLY DISCONNECTS. Spotify doesn't care about customer service and has been aware of these issues for YEARS. They don't care, just want our money."
"Highly unstable as of late. Freezes after exactly 10 minutes now since the most recent update. The redesign itself is a dumpster fire on its own. My neatly organized library is now just a content dump of artists, playlists and podcasts. Aggressive recommendation of certain podcasts is getting worse. Especially when already paying for premium. At least with YouTube Music, no ads means no ads. Also, the lack of account security in this day and age is embarrassing for a company of this size."
App will freeze when playing podcasts where it keeps playing but the play button freezes and the timer remains the same. Happy to change to 5 star once fixed.
"been a user since 2018, never had any complaints till now. please fix the sync between the desktop and mobile client, it's been so bad since the UI change! now my phone can't even act as a remote anymore, no music sync is actually happening between the two devices. moreover, with each app update the sync got even worse.. just please work on fixing it :'( PC-mobile sync is now officially at its worst. Please fix it."
Latest update has brought endless issues and a terrible user experience. Including song info not updating when changing tracks. Generally slow unresponsive app. Will be looking to cancel if nothing improves. Not sure what's changed for Spotify to go down hill recently but I don't feel in it's current state it's worth the premium
"It keeps crashing and stops playing music, it keeps saying that it's playing something while it is actually playing something else, the buttons don't work, can't press a different song, restarting doesn't work. I pay for Spotify."
"No Internet connection quite often, I have to play music from soundcloud and after 10-15 minutes Spotify app is working.... wow!!! Disappointed! If I press Shuffle it's playing the same songs every time, it's annoying, I will cancel my membership...."
"Banner that shows the current song sometimes freezes. The buttons and other parts of the app still work, but crash eventually several minutes later. Only a phone restart helps. S21 Android 11, OneUI 3.1."
"To any Android users, just download YouTube Vanced, you get YouTube premium and YouTube music premium for free, no ads. The Spotify app is terrible, the whole app needs remaking. Constant bugs, ads in podcasts even though I was on premium, crashes on start up, deletion of downloaded files, failure to download files, video only works on WiFi but only sometimes. Personally I don't like the UI at all either, I know it's personal taste though. I really don't understand why people use Spotify."
"Latest update: Poor layout and design not very intuitive. Plus their are bugs within the player itself. When you do finally get to your podcasts, they no longer play correctly. Half way through a podcast the player will display a previous podcast, and skip to a previous part of the audio of the one you are currently listening too (very weird), the control buttons lose their functionality or perform unexpected functions so listening is now very frustrating experience. Hoping for a update to fix"
"0 stars. I hate the new library view & have reverted to ver 8.6.18.720 from website ""Uptodown"". In 2019 the user interface went backward in that you no longer can view downloaded songs by artist & album forcing you to create playlists. In May 2021 the default library list now includes everything. No way of defaulting the view to ""playlists"" only, has only 4 pins & no sort order to list playlists first. This app continues to require more button pushes & steps to find the songs you want to play."
"Terrible UX: no lyrics, no comment, to listen to a certain podcast, it takes 7 clicks!! No lyrics in songs. Cannot arrange sequence in a song list. Cannot see the full title of a podcast program which is really ridiculous. Cannot see much of a program title from the podcast list. Cant replay 1 podcast... I would say it s very low cost efficiency comparing with e.g chinese apps. I strongly suggest the product team take a look at how ximalaya, xiami app, take care of their user experience."
"Sometimes, the play button gets stucked and I can't turn off the music. Even when I'm using headphones, instead of stopping the music when I disconnect them it keeps on playing the music. It's got to the point that it happens many more times than it should've been."
"I cancelled last month... You today renewed and charged me. Turns out i have to click several pages of cancel buttons. .. Why? This is misleading. Asked for refund, I don't intend to use the service and wont. If ignored I won't ever be returning to spotify."
"Spotify used to be a 4 or 5 star app for me, but the new My Library update for Android has made it virtually unusable. So unintuitive to use and it now crashes and shows blank screens, or takes about 20 seconds to load anything INCLUDING my downloads! The fact that podcasts and music are now lumped together in one list is such bad design, as is the case with the whole new My Library update. The old library UI on android was far more user friendly and leagues more intuitive."
"This app has been flooded with poor reviews but Spotify seems to have given up, and even stopped responding to reviews all together. A huge number of people are having problems with offline mode, loading and other stability issues. For myself, the biggest annoyance has been from adding songs to queue, being greeted with a green circle almost every single tapping the three dot button. It feels like this app has been abandoned for the last year. I don't think Spotify deserves our money anymore."
"App is awful lately, lots of skipping, changing the song randomly, and most recently my podcasts skip and the buttons stop responding, only solution is to uninstall and reinstall. Plus the cost for premium is going up, at this point it hardly feels worth it."
"App stops playing when closed. The music app I used before Spotify continued to play in the background even after being shut. This has been a built in feature from Google from nearly a decade ago and Spotify haven't even incorporated it. I plan to cancel my subscription and move app, such a simple feature that means a lot and you haven't bothered to invest in it. Disappointing."
"Everything about Spotify is great except one thing that triggers my whole being, the fact that you only get 6 skips per hour. It is really stupid and ruins the whole experience. Absolutely absurd. Also there are some ads which I dont mind that much, but some bugs which are really annoying. Got no choice but to rate it 1 star because of this awful experience."
Everything in my library randomly disappears. I cannot download anything without it also disappearing. This is quite honestly the worst app to use for music.
"WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SERVICE!!! After the latest update: the UI is confusing, bring back the previous one. The add to queue while in offline mode is terrible, the app crash after i add few songs. The overall offline mode is useless i can't stress anymore. Us your customers are paying monthly and this bugs are very dissapointing. Also it takes forever to launch the app even though we have a fast and stable internet connection so dissapointing!!!!"
"Utter shite! Another update (20 May 2021) and it's still not working. That's 5 spotify updates in the last fortnight and all they do is make it worse! Still doesn't load up properly and it still keeps saying ""no internet connection available"". I have a premium account and I can't bloody use it because your updates have ruined it! Sort it out spotify! You are pathetic!"
"This recent update is awful I've been using premium Spotify for years now. The recent update has made ruined any flow this app once had. The new offline mode is quite unusable, especially when it comes to podcasts."
The new menu for Library is terrible Podcasts can no longer be sorted by most recent upload. Downloads also now much harder to access. Worst mobile update in all my years of being a subscriber. MAY UPDATE: This has now been rolled out to production. UX stinks. New filters are garbage.
The new redesign is abysmal. It's incredibly frustrating and annoying to find and order my podcasts the way I want them and I don't think it even allows you to organise them by the date they were uploaded anymore. This whole update is just a massive step backward. Utterly hopeless.
"Spotify the service is great. The Android app, recently, has been awful. The playbar won""t update when playing so it shows the wrong song and a play button. The only way I can stop playing is to kill the app! If I connect any Bluetooth audio device Spotify starts playing immediately. When using Google Maps on Android Auto, I got snippets of Spotify music instead of audio instructions from Maps."
"Nice music source, huge variety, accessibility and pleasant design. I've tried premium and it's amazing but I couldn't use it forever, so as a free user I don't mind seeing ads. However recently I've started getting 2 ads instead of one and make it more frequent. On top of that only the first ad is sponsored and the second ad is the one that encourages me to buy premium or the one that thanks me for using Spotify and I believe hearing them for the 437th time is unnecessary. Edit: 3 ads now"
new update looks like it was designed by amateurs that have never designed an app before. it's completely unintuitive to navigate and frequently used features are hidden. The inability to sort podcasts by new episodes is the dumbest thing I've ever witnessed.
"Gets worse with every update. Instead of fixing the constant lag and inability to connect and stream, we get UI changes no one wanted. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻"
"Absolutely terrible, the app crashes all the time when I'm playing podcasts. This new update has completely ruined the app. If you don't fix it you're going to lose a lot of traffic."
"The last update broke the app. I can't sign in because the popup with the sign in button doesn't work anymore. I had log in without a password using email. I can no longer get song recommendations at the end of a playlist, just gives an error. PLEASE FIX"
"Man, ever since it came to Kenya the Canvas feature stopped working, the past 8 updates have been horrible—it takes too long to load and even sometimes says ""no internet connection"". Can you please just make the user experience consistently efficient. Like, I understand markets are different but at least make all the features available for third world market."
Not recommended. Never take paid subscription for this app. I have taken paid subscription but everyday I have to download the same songs again and again to listen offline and waste my data. This app keeps your downloaded songs just for one or two days only. All downloaded songs get deleted automatically and you have to download it again to listen offline. It's better to use it to listen online only as a guest user and never waste your money for subscription. I am quite unhappy.
App spends a lot of time being nonresponsive. Randomly stops playing. Requires restart of both my phone and the app and will still be nonresponsive for hours. Not really worth paying for.
"Latest update is the worst. UI Is garbage,and previously hidden songs are now permanently unplayable with no way to unhide them. Go back to the previous updates!"
"I personally really, really, really DONT like the new library. It's SO FULL and cluttered now. And I have to push extra buttons, just to have it like it was. Why. Why not let people make the library how they want, and let the people who don't want it just keep how it was. The app went from 5 to 1 star"
"Have to keep deleting this app because it keeps opening and playing even when I have the phone locked..Keeps draining my battery without me knowing and leaving phone battery flat, and phoneless. Not good and very inconvenient. Will NOT be continuing my subscription."
"music stop playing after 10 seconds, I've reinstall, restarted my device still cannot fix this. very frustrating because i pay for this app. the solutions from spotify community are not helpful at all, the problem still can't be fixed. spotify need to address this issue quickly because this issue has been going for years."
"Slow, buggy, completely non-intuitive UI. Poor recommendations with no way to tell it to stop suggesting truly terrible bands/genres/podcasts."
"After the last update and major change in design the app often appears laggy, not responsive, does not load thumbnails, doesn't load settings or libraries and displays ""no internet connection"" while there is a connection. Sometimes doing force stop on the app works and sometimes it does not. It's one big lottery now."
"New UI is clunky and hard to use. Having to use the ""tags"" to sort by artist and album rather than the simple library that spotify used to have is awful. Most of my artists disappeared when the changes happened. Please return the option to have the regular library"
"UPDATE: No longer love this! Spotify kept adding and changing ""what they thought I would like to my Playlist!"" I did not appreciate that. Would also change what artist I was listening to. I will go back to Pandora! ........ Love this app. Quick click and my favorite songs are all together. ❤"
"Honestly the new update it awful. The layout is messy and unorganised and getting to my playlist is just annoying as i now have to scroll through albums, artists and podcasts unless i filter it. Which i wouldnt have to do if they just left everything thing in tabs rather than this absolute mess of an app. Ontop of the worst layout Spotify has ever done, now my playlists play from bottom to top when put in recently added and i honestly cant think of a reason for this design"
"Constantly removing useful contents, UI get worse at every update, connections/stability of the app is terrible and often doesn't work or takes a lot of time to start."
"Ads about every third song, which seems like nothing but when you're just minding your business trying to listen to some playlist and then get interrupted by some woman whining about the perfection of premium every five-ten minutes, it gets irritating very quickly. Can't skip songs in playlist without premium. Can't play songs when you look them up without premium. Take your premium and shove it. I get that you need money but this is just pathetic. The app is pretty much unusable without paying."
"I can't recommend Spotify. I pay for premium and still get promoted content. It constantly crashes in the background. The company decides to make major UI changes instead of changing how they handle NSFW content (don't let your kids use this app, the ""Explicit Content"" option does not work, particularly with podcasts and there is no way to hide content you don't want to see)."
"F#%$ this app and the developers. You offer thirty minutes of music to watch a quick add, then you play 3-4 ads, play a SINGLE song, then it goes back to multiple ads. False advertising at its finest. F&$% you."
Latest update turns music off every 2-3 songs and i have to push the play button to restart. VERY FRUSTRATING!! back to Pandora until its fixed!
"Used to work flawlessly. Now has been extremely slow and glitchy the last 4 months. Update 5/13/21: Unnecessary UI refresh, backend still has major issues. App continously freezes."
"Unfortunately, using this app has felt like more of a chore than anything else. The app constantly ceases to function correctly nearly every single time I use it. This app has been suffering from major stability problems that have been documented in a large number of reviews. The only way I have found to make the app somewhat functional is to constantly clear cache and force stop the app. I don't enjoy submitting negative reviews but in this case I feel that it's justified. The app has been suffering from these stability issues for about a year now which I have never seen from a large company. I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the app's poor user experience, especially considering that the service is a paid subscription. For now, if anyone is experiencing loading issues, try force quitting the app and clearing the cache first before uninstalling the app or restarting your phone."
"okay, first of all this app torchers us to buy spotiy premium. It has more adds than songs, for 1 song why do we have to hear 13 adds ?! dont download this app, but theres no choice. Why do we only have spotify as the app to listen music ? so that we learn coding ? you guys and girls are really lucky that u r looking at this, this review was quite helpful and would give u a trailer of this ugh app. Someday ill ban it, and dont dare to delete songs again, sparing u 4 now. bye for now bye."
"It worked great for a while, but now it doesn't even load my music. My fiance has the same problem on his phone. The app will tell us we have no internet even when we are connected to wifi or data and every other app that requires internet is working fine. Its beyond frustrating."
"They changed the layout a few years back making is much less intuitive, but my biggest gripe is how freaking buggy the app is on the Joe rogan podcast, its always freezing up and allowing me to play what i want"
"Latest update ruined the app for me. Before, it was a solid 4 stars, but the change to the playlists is so assanine it blows my mind. At LEAST give us a simple toggle in settings to get the old way back, it is not that difficult to implement."
"Sooooooo slow it's ridiculous. It takes ages to load artist lists or podcast lists and then ages to load the artist page then ages to start playing. The new podcast menu is terrible and takes more Clicks to get through to new episodes. The play button that comes up when you open the app disappears for several seconds for reasons I'll never understand before it reappears and becomes usable. Very frustrating, especially when I'm paying for it"
"The app was great until the latest update which now requires me to restart the app numerous times before it is usable. Doesn't respond when initially opened, cannot navigate within the menus. Very annoying as the app worked great until this latest update!"
"The new way you select items from your library is so cumbersome and not intuitive, it used to be easy to one handed switch artists or albums now it's almost impossible to do without both hands"
"Most recent update sucks. I genuinely don't understand why apps keep making updates that don't actually improve anything, just make the interface different and more difficult to use while you adjust to it. And then as soon as you get used to it, they change it again. Absolute garbage!"
"The new library screen is horrible. Why would you combine my playlists, artists, and albums into one folder? It looks terrible, is frustrating and inconvenient, and the new ""bubble buttons"" to select one section look aweful. Why are we racing backwards?"
"Recent update is pretty garbage, who is thinking this is better? I liked the new albums that would display in the home page...now it only shows one new album. Menu filtering is garbage....why would someone think that removing alphabetical order and replacing it with seemingly random order is better? Some 'ux' experts trying to justify their pay probably"
"Latest update is garbage. Takes forever to load, drops all the time, routinely non responsive to any command or click... idk how y'all manage to make this a progressively worse user experience but somehow you pull it off."
I like to download podcasts to listen to offline. But now if I want to listen to a podcast I downloaded I have to connect to the internet which entirely defeats the purpose of me downloading podcasts in the first place. So for the love of God go back to the old UI that actually worked.
Will try to make you get in an accident while driving if you listen to anything else. Highjacks audio and wont quit til you force stop or delete the app. Thanks joe.. no thanks spotify.
Spotify in it's first few forms was pretty great. It was intuitive and easy to use. Now with every update it seems they keep changing the UI for no reason. The app has quickly become not intuitive and increasingly difficult to navigate.
"Is it possible to switch back to a previous version of the app? App was working great until the latest update, now the ui makes it harder to find my playlists, and on top of that, the app always hangs now."
WHY does the new update require going online to start a downloaded podcast!? It makes the app useless for camping or trail running. I will cancel my premium subscription if this isn't fixed soon.
"Review 5🌟➡️1🌟.The new update is failing in acceptance testing. Why did you move the Save to Your Library ""button""? I also hate that now when I add a new album to my playlists it only shows the album title without the artist."
"Disgraceful UI, specially for a supposedly tech firm. An UX designer intern would do better after a 30 minutes browse on Google's Material design from some 10 years ago. Selecting content only possible one by one, never heard of long press multiselection, really? Then removing them is 2 clicks, each? Even worse, selection adds to Your Episodes, which does not appear on the Garmin watch side, so need to use the three dot + add episode + select playlist route, 3 click for each piece of content?"
"This new update is horrible. All I want is to go to 'My Playlists' and see them in the order that I chose. Not some 'dynamic' changing thing, i dont want to have to filter my library when i go there.. quick, easy playlist selection is gone. Let me roll back to a previous version. To get to my playlist list, i now have to select playlist, select downloaded (because they dont show otherwise), change the sort to something else, then back to 'Custom Order' Roll back these changes. They are brutal."
New update causes playlist to play songs in reverse order when sorted by recently added. I like to listen so songs I've added to my dump playlist most recently to and it's completely ruined the way I listen to music. Fix it please or I'll be using a different a different service.
First few days were fine but now I can't get music playing. I had Google Play Music which was waaay better. This was my only go to and it is a fail for me at this time. I can't buy a subscription for something that keeps loading and does nothing with or without wifi access. I also miss having the option of searching for a song and finding it right away as I need music while driving I want to find my exact song quickly. Spotify finds it and charges me if I want to hear it. That should be sample
"I used this app for half a year and I had Premium, after that the app required to renew the bank card info or something..After this it logged out and when I logged in there was no music that I added at all. I don't remember artists and names of the songs and it makes me sad cause I can't listen to my favorite songs anymore...."
The Your Library update makes is unintuitive and deliberately breaks the workflow of listeners. I really don't want to have to spend 30 seconds sorting my library every time I open the app before I can put music on. It's ridiculous and was frankly my last straw. Ending my subscription and moving to Apple Music.
"New UI sucks so bad. Didn't know it was possible to be made worse but somehow Spotify managed. Terrible app. UPDATE: It gets worse, the search function won't even pull up albums that u have downloaded. Absolute trash. Gonna wait a couple weeks and see if they fix it. Otherwise I'm looking for a different streaming service."
"Ive been a premium user since 2015. This app has simply gotten worse and worse. The UI is frequently changed to the detriment of finding your music, and after the latest update it rarely even let's me use the menus or play music before freezing with ""no connection."""
"Always freezing and not able to always connect via Bluetooth after ""UPDATE"". You would think something you pay for would actually work the way it's designed."
"The new(er) UI is even worse than before! And please, stop with the race and political advertising. Stop recommending it to me, I don't want to listen to Barack Obama with Bruce Springsteen or the most popular ""Are and Be"" songs that I could care less about."
"Who needs this junk when you can fill your device with thousands of songs? Doesn't interrupt your music with ads, doesn't require a subscription, and doesn't rely on an internet connection. And spotify doesn't have a graphic equalizer, my .mp3 player does."
"The last update's new library tab ruined the whole Spotify experience for me. Also, if I am in an area without cell reception, I need to go into airplane mode to see my downloaded tracks. Otherwise the app constantly tries to pull data, which it obviously can't."
Most recent update was so unnecessary and changed the entire user experience and functionality.. Provide the option to change back to old layout please??!!
"Why can't I play the song I want, i look up a song and i see it so i hit play but for some reason a different song from a different band plays and I have to skip it to play my song that I wanted and thats not a guarantee because for some reason the play button is stuck on shuffle but oh okay wait i can only skip 6 times pure hour what the hell man I just want to listen to my music I pick"
Way to many repetitive ads. There is about 5 ads for every song. Also when it says press this button to watch an ad to get 30 minutes of ad free music it never works and gives you 5 ads and doesn't even give you 30 minutes of ad free music.
Shout out to Spotify for changing the app layout. Problem is the new layout is terrible. It is not user friendly and honestly makes no sense in design or function. I had given up premium for YouTube music a while ago and will be switching back to stitcher for podcasts.
"Every time I think Spotify can't make their UI and general experience more frustrating, they lower the bar even further. It's like a race to the bottom. Would you like to search for episode names in a Podcast? Nah, scroll through 700 episodes. Don't think the UI can get any less intuitive? Boy do we have a convoluted, day ruining update for you! -5/5"
"I have spotify premium and after the update my next song and back buttons are switched. So when I press next song, it goes back. And when I press back it goes to my next song. It's annoying, please fix it."
"Spotify constantly chooses overly simplistic UI over having a straightforward experience. After the most recent update the Library is overly confusing and has all of the different albums, playlists and podcasts in one list fpr no reason. After using Spotify for close to 5+ years, it seems they only want to make it harder to use for people who listen and organize a wide variety of music."
Loved it but the new update is horrible. My queue doesn't work and it is almost impossible to see what I've recently downloaded. Not intuitive. Frustrating.
"After this new update podcasts, playlists and albums live under the same tab, with possible filters. Mediocre design choice, but liveable except for one crucial missing feature: the ability to filter by artist (and not just album). Preferably alphabetically (an option removed last year). Please correct this dubious choice"
Made the library tab more complicated with smaller buttons without adding any extra functionality. Just adds to the list of reasons to move to another service
I moaned about this yesterday And guess what. It was deleted. I hate the new UI and it's so slow and some songs don't load at all. And a lot of the songs are popular ones as well Also started playing infected by starset at 2 am but oh well Why would you mix podcasts on with 0laylist when they where already perfectly arranged into there own areas. Also it keeps crashing on my more than average phone It also feels like they just want money because I used to have free and the ads made fun of you...
"I've had a paid subscription for as long as I can remember, and always felt it was value for money. But man, the latest update is soooo incredibly bad. I mean, if it ain't broke and all. Least user friendly update I've ever seen, on any app, EVER. Ruined my podcast listening experience."
"After the current update all downloaded podcasts are hidden in the new library filter system. This system adds more clicks complexity and load times which slows down the experience. Just leave a list of downloaded materials, the way it was before so users can play, add or delete quickly and seamlessly under one menu. This reminds me of the improvement when Spotify removed the widget then after backlash promptly reinstated it after backlash."
Ive been a paid sub for a couple years now. Loved making my own playlists for the work radio and listening to podcasts and all that OFFLINE when im working in the boonies. Well with this new update its gone entirely down hill. It wont load any of my downloads... Says im offline as if thats a problem for content that should be saved offline anyway? Nothing will load at all. The new layout that no longer seperates music from podcasts is just so awful and the designer responsible should feel bad.
"The most recent update limits the ability to see when podcasts I follow have uploaded new episodes. Counterintuitive to sorting through content, and the opposite of user-friendly. Terrible new design."
App has been unreliable and very frustrating when coming to just playing music or podcasts. I have been a long time subscriber and this current build of the app is rife with bugs and clunky interface changes.
"More expensive than Netflix for much less in return. When I had gone back to basic plan, sound quality was terrible and unable to play the desired (even favorited) tracks. Not to mention ads that clearly were designed to be annoying. Going back to my mp3 collection. And this is why Spotify is losing money."
"Every time I open this app, it's worse. It's not slowly getting worse, it takes huge steps down day after day. The only reason I even still use this app is because I was too lazy to find my podcasts a different way, but even this is now unintuitive and convoluted. Everything that was one tap before is now five taps and now I have to actively search for new updates when the old UI just sorted it by date by default It's like they read a design 101 book and made it their mission to burn it all down"
Why is search in a playlist not only hidden on a menu but 6 options under. Terrible UX decision. It should be a above delete Playlist. People tend to use this option more. Delete should be lower on the list. Stop making the app crumblesome.
"The new Library UI made me lose all of my previous podcast downloads. The new ""my episodes"" playlist is fiddly to navigate to. Plus the app is very glitchy and sometimes doesn't load at all. Considering stopping my premium subscription and going elsewhere. At the very least please get me my old downloads back?"
Edit 5/5 Somehow you've managed to make me miss your old UI. The library is now even worse than it was to begin with. Why can I no longer sort podcasts by newly updated? I don't get why you insist on removing features.
"The app is going downhill for quite a while. Getting rid of features that were working well and implementing stuff that nobody wants or didn't ask for. Making it slower and the usability more awkward. It's sad, cause this app makes you really move forward to a different music app. Cancel subscription."
"Hey Spotify, love the app, literally hate the new update with the burning passions of 1000 sun's. I spent so much time organising my library and you ruined it completely. Podcast, playlists and albums should not be on the same page."
"Whoever approved a less readable UI requiring more taps to get through and increased ads with SHUFFLE ON DEFAULT should be fired. From a cannon. I've been a Premium user for years but this stuff is still hitting me, too. Why would I pay for a rotten experience like this? I'm looking for competitors and will be unsubscribing. I mostly used this to listen to podcasts and now they're impossible to navigate. Who designed this new UX? A boardroom full of AI?"
"Every redesign is worse than the one before. Stop moving buttons, stop buying the buttons I do need behind unnecessary menus. Let me deleted ""your episodes"" I don't need or want this."
"I don't want to be rude but I genuinely, from the bottom of my heart HATE this latest update that dumps all podcasts and albums and playlists in one long list. It is TERRIBLE. Please please please change it back. I listen to alot of podcasts and I have a system for doing it and this update ruins it completely"
The new UI is terrible. Why do I want to see everything from podcasts to music and my listening history on one screen? Fix that cluster.
"REMOVE THE VOICE ICON IF I DONT HABE VOICE ENABLED! Simple as that. I can't believe your team is so bad they can't even properly remove the icon if I disable voice control. Also, it's a voice control, why even bother with a top layer icon that constantly annoys you? This design is so stupid. REMOVE THE VOICE ICON!"
"The app keeps telling me I am offline even though my LTE is working , and all my other apps requiring data are working just fine. This has been happening for 3 weeks now. It is getting very frustrating considering I pay a monthly fee for a working service. In addition, I gave to reset my Spotify password at least once bi-weekly because apparently ""suspicious "" activity keeps happening ... I get logged in in other countries... Spotify is the only music app this happens with. Security is lacking."
"What's with this new update? It has made it more of a chore to access my downloaded music from the artist library. Used to go straight to downloaded albums from that artist and now I'm being brought to their page and having to navigate to the album I want, preventing me from playing multiple albums without making a whole playlist for it. This is bad design."
"Fails to load podcasts correctly. Fails to buffer audio in a timely fashion. Pushes 30 second ads regardless of being a Premium user or not; I *was* the entire time. Fails to download podcasts/music according to your settings. Podcasts stutter on playback CONSTANTLY, even while DOWNLOADED. Terribly designed app in terms of navigation and QOL. Edit: It's even worse now. If I could give 0 stars I would. I am no longer a premium user due to the complete disregard for the Android app. Horrible."
Dudes. Why did you make it more difficult to find your downloaded podcasts? Why is there not 1 button to press now? Do you guys think or just go hey this is pretty and hope it works? Other than that the changes are fine but gee wiz. Stop 🤣 Also why does there need to be an option to go to offline mode to listen to downloads? Why does my podcast need to load when I have it downloaded 🤣 Hilarious keep it up guys...
What the f@#$! has happened to the app! It says there's no interent connection when I'm 6 feet from the router and has slowed down to a crawl. No thumbnails open. The last update has ruined the app! Why do I pay for the premium service for something that won't even open?
"The UI of the app has gotten progressively worse, up to a point where i cannot find single episodes on podcasts, which has been my main use of spotify."
Super buggy and lags a lot. App will freeze up and keep playing even after closing it. Have to go into settings and force stop to make it quit playing in the background.
Paying for Premium but only see shuffle play on mobile? I upgraded to premium and trying to play albums in order but I only see the green shuffle play button theres no reg play button? I've looked online & don't see a fix? Reinstalled app also made sure the left bottom shuffle button was turned off / gray???? Please Help!
I don't like where they put the dislike button. Hidden in the submenu I wish it was right next to the heart button like the way they used to have it. If I dislike the song and don't want to hear it again I don't want to waste time hearing the song. Hunting to the submenu letting it refresh and then hitting the dislike button. They should keep it on the more accessible instead of having to hit three buttons to hit one button
"Spotify are quick to take payment, for some strange reason I cannot log in (I've had this account 2 years and never had an issue). Now my account has completely disappeared....after payment has been taken of course. So I have paid my premium for nothing. Am I able to contact Spotify....NO... as my account has disappeared and they are only contactable if you log in to your account. I am absolutely fuming. WHY ARE YOU CONTIUNING TO EFFECTIVELY STEAL MONEY FROM MY BANK ACCOUNT?????????????????"
"Canceled subscription. Spotify could not fix major app bugs. App did not open pages of artists and albums (annoying message ""sorry, something went wrong""). On phone app showed that playing music, but no sound actually and playback progress bar was not moving. Like button did nothing. App was up to date, cleared cache, relogged, restarted phone, reinstalled app, nothing helped. Could only listen music on computer and use phone as remote control. Today lost all playlists. Unreliable service."
Loading is terrible. They used to have quick downloads but now every time I turn it on I wait 20 minutes while nothing happens. Then I close it and debate cancelling. Today I decided to do it! I will wait the hour it takes for it to load and remove my payment info tonight
"Quite bad actually, unfortunately; because there been way too many extra dang hurdles of having my account linked to my computer and then there was a roller coaster with my premium student discount, so I said nah not worth it - Roarr!"
"New update is absolutely awful, I don't know who at Spotify though this was a good idea, but it's not. Mashing everything together into one list is very annoying, you should've at least included the option to revert the UI to what it was previously"
"Literally begs for money. I'll be listening to music on a playlist I made, and 60 percent of the song are songs I didn't add, which can only be avoided with spotify premium. Want to skip them? Need spotify premium. Want no ads every two songs? Need spotify premium. Even the ""30 minute ad free"" ads aren't honest anymore. Genuinely, I recommend making a playlist on YouTube because you can easily look for songs, free playlists that dont add songs, and doesn't beg for money."
"The most recent update completely ruins all stored music, everything is in one terribly jumbled mess of artists, albums, podcasts and songs. Garbage update, revert it."
"Update has ruined it. Spotify has never been a problem for me, until the new updates that they have done. When I play music, the song that's playing never shows and it stops are random times for no reason. I cant see what is being played at all."
Was great and then you went a ruined the ui for no reason. Let me have my playlists/artists/albums separate. There might be people who like the change but how about give us the option
"So desperate to sell the premium, totally ruins the moment... either make it absolutely for the ones who pays or elongate the ad inverval.. having ad is ok but it comes after every 2-3 songs.. so irritating...."
"I subscribe. I use the equaliser to alter sound to my liking, if I use another app while running Spotify the sound just resets every time to ""flat"". I have a decent phone. I can only assume its Spotify itself. I have now subscribed to an alternative. Not a major fault but definitely an annoying, reoccurring problem that ruins the enjoyment of it"
"This app is bad for android users, first l will have to see the preview of the music and you can't even play it, unless if you have Spotify premuim. This isn't a good change of Spotify on android...."
"Quickly became trash. It was great before. Now I watch an ad for ""30 minutes ad free"" hear ONE song and have another 3 ads. Pushing for people to pay for premium is making me want to delete entirely."
"bugs. spotify song selection is p good except for when they dont have specific songs from artists (but everything else they made is there?) my issue is everytime it updstes theres some new bug that makes it unusable. for example i used to have a problem where if i try and play a song it will ""start"" but no music plays. and i'll scrub back to the beginning and restart the app. now i cant press any buttons. fix this please!"
I'm sick of Spotify constantly changing the UI. The latest update was my last straw. I'm canceling my family package and moving to YouTube Music. The UI is atrocious!
Long time user first time complainer. Up until this week I have had little to no problem or complaints however I am currently unable to use the app as it refuses to register that I am online and thusly cant load even the home page. When the problem started I could force quit the app and it would correct fir a short period now however nothing works and it is 100% non functioning. I am a paying customer and the app does not function on my phone.
Serious problems in the playback! It stutters as in when I hit the 15sec back button it goes all the way back to where I had paused it before continuing it...
"Not only is the app a buggy mess on Android auto now, the new library tab is now unnecessarily complicated and unintuitive. Extra buck a month for less usability is really pushing me towards other apps."
"Ran this app and had Spotify Premium but I uninstalled it today when I learned Spotify carries podcasts by COVIDiots, eg. Joe Rogan, telling people to refuse vaccination. I refuse to fund their terrorist activities. Update: after deleting the app and canceling Premium I received a barrage of harassing emails. I then requested they delete my account entirely. For that I got 30 minutes of run around nonsense disguised as concern for me. I deeply regret the day I installed this app."
"Despite turning the setting off and having over 100 unique songs in the playlist, the app insists on playing completely unrelated and unwanted songs as Suggestions which is already purposely limiting the app to an already horribly limited free user experience. I attempted to leave this issue as a note on their forums but I found even their forums are unresponsive and unusable."
"terrible. it was okay when I first got it, I could listen to all my favorite songs. and now just then I started crying from frustration because it kept playing songs that were not in my playlist, and even played a song that I have a genuine fear of. if I could give 0 stars I would. I just wanted to listen to my favorite songs."
The new UI has to be the worst I've ever seen. Can't listen to downloaded songs unless you have service. Laggy. Terrible app and service.
"What the hell were they thinking with the new UI? *FIX BELOW* To anyone reading this, I recommend turning off automatic updates, uninstalling spotify, then do a google search for ""spotify apk 8.5.98"" to revert to the last usable version. You will probably need to aprove a popup that asks you if you want to install an app from this source, along with a warning. Obviously this is ""at your own risk"" but if you use one of the bigger apk sites you should be fine."
You need to pull youre finger out of your tech support and find a answer why Spotify likes to stop playing 2 seconds after we pushed the play button..... I've uninstall and reinstalled the bloody app and it still does this... I'm paying g money for your services and you can't give me the god dam answer why its doing this in your support... think I might just cancel this subscription and delete you entirely.
"I've had premium for years and it has been great, until these last few months. It will randomly shut off music, tell me that I'm offline and can't listen offline when I clearly have signal and my other apps work. So 4 months later and the app still quits playing music randomly."
"Premium users cannot get rid of Ads It really frustrates the user experience to pay for premium to avoid ads, and being forced to SEE ads on the Home page, which btw are completely irrelevant to my taste. Removing the ads between songs is not enough guys. Literally I'm paying premium to NOT see or hear Ads. This truly impacts the experience, from an ethical point of view. Very disappointing. Also, UX wise, how is it that we cannot customise the Home page, it's such a basic feature."
"The latest update is total garbage, there was nothing wrong with the previous format and this keeps freezing. Thanks for ruining something that was perfectly fine!"
"Pretty disappointed for a paid service with that many users. Mobile data restrictions don't work properly. Uses way too much data for 'low' streaming quality and tries to download everything without wifi even though I have explicitly turned that off. Initially thought this was only a temporary bug, but has been that way now for years. Instead of constantly implementing new features and changing the UI, I would expect Spotify to at first fix all the old bugs..."
"Last update ruined the app, revert the changes. I open up the app and it says no internet connection, takes like 15 minutes for it to actually work. Smh like broke the app when it didn't need an update."
"If you play 4 ads after every 3 songs...you are ruining the whole freaking experience of music...and that seems the strategy for you guys...create a problem and sell the solution. Companies these days, push their niche customer base to such extremities just so that people get so fed up that they buy the premium...even if I buy the spotify premium, it's like im paying you to not irritate me...I mean wth...I would have bought the premium if I wasn't bullied into buying it"
"This app is honestly THE WORST I HAVE ON MY PHONE. First, it takes a long, then it shows almost 10 ads, THEN I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE SONG I WANNA PLAY?! LIKE IS IT REQUIRED FOR ME TO BUY PREMIUM?? Seriously, I have to listen to a whole playlist with songs that i dont like. And i have only 6 skips an hour, which makes it worse. Plus, you cant even skip the time you wanna play, like i wanna repeat the song and i have to wait for a whole playlist. AND THE ADS. JUST STOP IT, THIS UPDATE IS ANNOYING!!"
"The app doesn't allow me to pick songs I want anymore and the suggested songs ruin the damn app. One time im listening to roddy ricch, then an ava max song plays, it just ruins the whole thing"
"dear god the new ui is awful. all of the categories only show 1 album, and I've already listened to or liked most of them. how am I supposed to find new albums. it's also rarely synced between my laptop, which is annoying."
"App constantly closes out when first opened very annoying it does this at least twice before it will actually stay open. I would expect Spotify to easily and quickly fix a rather minor problem but instead no months later it still does the same thing even after several updates that clam ""improvement"" Update to my original review now Spotify does not even open I have to close out the app several times before I can use it"
It's already started it for anything today for people with that have money and have money to pay dstv I mean like Spotify premium because I don't have money for Spotify premium we have to go through a lot and Tracy I would not recommend this app anybody cuz it's absolute nonsense and she's genuinely not enough and I don't think next time that you put in the comment section is cuz they eat this evening and it's just really a waste of memory space and date is in just it's always I wouldn't recomme
"Lately the app has been glitchy and nearly u functional at times. It constantly disconnects from wifi/data. Takes a while to register clicks in the app. Also, the like button doesn't always appear when you have liked a song. It's just a poor user experience."
"I don't know what the deal is but spotify stops playing mid track, AND it's starts playing randomly after I pause videos. It's insanely annoying. The phone app also won't connect to my Galaxy Watch 3 app. I have a Samsung Galaxy s20 and I'm only continuing to use this app because of original podcasts. Please fix this!!!"
"In the last few months, the app has been very very slow to respond (this on a flagship phone). It's extremely annoying and ruins the user experience. Pages can take MINUTES to load at times. How hard can it be to return a list of songs? Why does it take so long to return my list of podcasts? Come on Spotify, what are we paying premium for?"
"When I clicked the play button the song i want to listen to is not playing, instead other unknown artists and musics were the one playing. It just like a freaking ads!"
"Grrr from 4 stars to 1 I'm no longer able to listen to a whole song without it pausing for a few seconds numerous times which ruins the song....seems to be happening when I connect to bluetooth, or when using other apps ... Already looking for something new... Not happy considering I pay close to $20 a month.!!! Very dissapointing.."
"New update markedly worsens user experience and functionality. Having the recently played songs is nice, but I want the swipe menu back, I can't get to my daily mixes any more without having to search for it and even then it requires a lot of scrolling and the shirt artist list has disappeared. I used the swipe menu a lot, ay leats have it as an option."
"All songs available . Awesome.THE CONTINUOUS ADDS AFTER EACH 2-3 SONGS WITHOUT PREMIUM IS POINTLESS AND IS THE REASON FOR 1 STAR. Plus, the premium is pointless for most users. It is not required. In fact add are ok until they are not eating you patience after every couple of songs..."
"Great music, but this app must have the worst UI/UX on earth. I clicked in the link of an e-mail you sent me with new singles and I can't manage to listen to the song. I want to hear that Pearl Jam song not Stone Temple Pilots song. Also, how it is so hard to connect to Chrome cast? It just drops, while netflix, youtube, everything else works perfectly. Edit: I'm lowering the score because in 2021 this still happens."
"It's a good app overall, but it just keeps stopping by itself, if I open another app, sometimes even without opening another app. And what the hell is this scene with premuim? Every app has a paid and unpaid version, but premium ads are freaking annoying. Do you want us to stop using this app at all??"
Had our premium account compromised. once I figured out how to contact customer service while locked out of my account it was quickly fixed. Cyber criminals should be beaten to death with hammers. Now my spotify account randomly starts while I'm watching other media. Same thing on my wife's phone. It's related to google assistant somehow.
"I'm on Spotify Premium. And the repeat button disappears at random. Last time I successfully used it was for my daughter, but now I cant deselect repeat to listen to music normally. It's been 3 days where the heck is it?"
Skipping causes the UI to get stuck. I have to take the app to the background and then back to the forground to skip a couple of songs before it gets stuck again.
"The ONLY reason I have Spotify is so I can listen to Joe Rogan. I hate Spotify, it's always crashing. You click one episode and it plays a different one, or if it does play the episode you selected halfway through after an ad it'll switch to a different one. I used to listen to every episode, now, unless it's someone I just HAVE to listen to, I'd assume to listen to silence. Spotify has completely ruined the Joe Rogan Experience!"
"New improvements break basic functionality... Time to stop paying? Choose a track, starts playing, pause the track on the lower track bar & you can't start it again as there's no play button?!? Click on the track bar to get the full screen and you can poke the pause/play button & get it going, but, the time index display doesn't move as the track plays, & there's no pause button just a play button even though the tracks playing?! Who TF ""develops"" this? Who TFF tests this? US! FOR £10 A MONTH!"
Since the recent update the song displayed as Now Playing is out of sync with the track actually being played. Edit:I keep stumbling across more ways that the ui doesn't keep pace with your actions. E.g. Add song to liked list doesn't update the icon showing that it's in your liked list.
"Had premium for over 3 years been great for the most part. Switched phones to the S21 ultra, lost all my daily playlists, and I'm still waiting for the algorithm to find consistency with what i like etc. Which is very annoying as it should be a cloud based service not linked to your device or better yet at least transferable if cloud is not an option. More annoyingly though spotify has been full of bugs recently - freezing & continuing to play music but i cant see what music it is...Dissapointed"
"Says I'm offline often, loads extremely slowly, buttons within app are unresponsive for long periods, among other problems have started within last couple weeks. Support can't seem to help, guess it's time to switch to Tidal"
"Soptify premium just proves it how greedy people can be with money. The fact that you can't even pick your song and just play things on shuffle ruins the whole song experience. It seems like they're trying to downgrade the free version as much as possible to make the premium look better. Total disappointment, just use Youtube."
Quite literally the worst experience I've ever had trying to listen to a Podcast. Doesn't keep my place constant ads freezes all the time. All the time it will display the wrong song or wrong Podcast and what I'm actually listening to. Genuinely don't understand how a platform so a large is so bad.
"App freezes with the latest version when trying to do anything of the app. I was able to play music by tapping a non existing play button where it should be when playing music. I force stop, clear cache of the app nothing. Was able to get it to work after I restart the phone."
"Watch this short video for 30 mins of ad free listening? Watches video, then 3 ads play right after then 1 song plays then another ad and another ad and another ad then song then more ads. Why would I pay for premium when you've already lied to me? Will premium let me down too? How could we ever rebuild trust? You should probably go stay with your mother Spotify and start looking for a new apartment because love doesn't live here anymore. I feel betrayed and irritated by your mere presence. 😒"
"Joe Rogan is the only reason this app is still on my phone. I listen to all my other podcasts and music on another app. The user experience/ergonomics are awful. The android auto functionality is terrible. Random ads will crash the podcast when they try to play in android auto, so hopefully you remember where you were. The fast forward buttons don't integrate into the vehicle like EVERY OTHER MEDIA APP. If the base app wasn't so bad I would pay for premium like I do for other apps."
Search bar was moved into the 3 dot menu within my playlists. This is an atrocious move as it was more efficient to have the search bar appear at the top when you scroll down. Spotify need to reconsider the end user experience when making these decisions.
"The stupid ""Your Episodes"" playlist being forced on me ruined my entire experience enough for me to consider moving to another music app. If they don't fix their idiotic design flaw I will stop considering and make the switch. Why screw with the beautiful simple design?"
"Required to much personal info to be acceptable for a service that streams music, be fine if it wasn't obvious you profit on my usage as well as charge the user to use service uninterrupted for ""30 mins"". Not about the cost, integrity! Any other IRL system like that would be considered a scam, and avoided! Additionally, they send ads to your email and justify ads by not interrupting your listening nvm the 1a.m. email! I attempted to address this with the service dept and was in short told gtfo!"
The music is stopping on its own even though I have allowed all permissions and it's quite pissing me off. Please someone solve that issue sooner. It's really getting annoying.
"Everytime I pick a playlist, it randomly starts playing ""suggested songs"" even though I asked for the playlist and turned off the suggested songs button. It never works."
I love Spotify and pay for premium but the performance of the app over the last 6 months has quite frankly been awful to the point it doesn't actually work most of the time. Android and PC are both completely terrible and with each update it isn't getting any better.
"UX nightmare and it gets worse with every update. Barely used features get their own buttons on the UI (radio based off playlist???) and no search bar. You need to go to the top of the screen to select the hamburger menu, then to the bottom to select ""search"" and then to the top to start searching, and finally bottom again to type on the keyboard."
"Can anyone help me? After updating to Samsung's One UI 3, I've never been able to install spotify. Spotify lite is fine, but the regular version isn't installing, no matter what I do."
The android version is shi*show. The likes songs disappear frequently. Offline music doesn't work most of the times. Like button is buggy. It's just so frustrating! 😤
Spotify. I don't want to switch to premium. Please stop popping ads right in my ears when i want to listen peaceful songs. Ads ruin the mood and kill the buzz while listening the songs. Please stop doing this. It hurts people personally.
"WHERE IS LYRICS ??(I uninstalled and reinstalled but it's still not there WHERE did the feature gone) Who told you I like Bollywood songs, UI is pretty good but song recommendation is terrible, Hey spotify I don't know Hindi so stop recommending me Hindi songs, This app is worthless after latest update. Never put songs in ads it will just malign your Image and make ads pleasurable to my ears. That Hindi speaking guy is giving cancer to ears."
"So imagine paying $10 a month, then listening to a podcast that has 10 minutes straight of ads before you even start listening. Then imagine getting more ads between the podcast, but then imagine you skipping the ads with the fast forward button, but then imagine that when you do that your podcast starts all over again and you don't know the time stamp that you were at. That is what spotify does. Thanks Spotify."
"New update broke the app, again. Super buggy, songs stop playing for no reason. Menu takes forever to load. Like seriously what are y'all doing? Everytime it starts working fine a new update just ruins it again."
"Gets worse all the time. Whatever this bs about the my episodes playlist being required for offline podcast streaming, please cut it out. I used to enjoy spotify premium, now I am shopping around for better apps."
"I can't seem to share a song from spotify to my Instagram story. I've been battling with this problem for over a week now. I don't have issues when sharing across other apps but spotify seems to get quite moody when it's instagram. I have uninstalled spotify, installed it again, but I still have issues. Also, I tried browsing the website - Help and Support, but I couldn't find any solution. So basically, in a nutshell, I'm not happy."
"Why is the app still called free if you can't choose what music you want to listen to without paying? ""So you want to listen to your favorite song? Why don't you listen to this completely unrelated song instead? You can pay us to skip it, or listen to it and the 20 other random songs we've selected."" UI is also pretty bad, and the search function is case sensitive."
You managed to ruin a once great app. The saved music organization is completely shot with this latest update. Why get rid of the followed artists list? Completely ridiculous.
Was the best the new updates came through and you can't listen to what and when you want and there's all these commercials now. Way to ruin the best app out there thanks another Spotify. Do not download.
It was quite enough good in previous. But it is not good at all in recent. Because I can't even hear my own playlist peacefully. Why do you bother by showing different music on my own playlist?? It sucks.. Why do you add music automatically that I don't wanna hear even? What's wrong with you?? Who the hell spend money on such things!! So why do I need to spend money to skip song whenever I want!?!
"The decisions this company continues to make in regards to the UI changes are continuously and utterly disappointing. When sorting by artists, why not take me to my saved songs by that artist? Its like these people don't listen to music, or maybe they just realize they're own app is trash and they refuse to use it. Also, pay your artists."
"You library is no longer organized or organizable. This is absolutely intolerable UI. If this isn't fixed, I'll be deleting my entire Spotify account, which I've had for years. Also, searching through podcasts on this app sucks out loud, please make a standalone podcast player."
"Spotify has a lot of great elements and its desktop app is gold, but Spotify for Android is garbage. Crashing, lagging, songs cutting out, download glitches that result in albums showing up twice, and more. Legitimately one of the worst user experiences I have ever encountered and with almost a year of use on this thing, I don't anticipate them fixing it anytime soon. Their local file tool is also busted half the time and super janky.Great service, garbage app. Also, pay your artists better."
"The GUI was incomprehensible, auto-play refused to turn off, and you can't even turn off shuffle. Nevermind the fact that after a while of listening to anything besides podcasts the app would force in ""suggested"" music. The suggestions themselves were good, tho I was not able to turn them off. I tried restarting the playlist but that just unpaused the suggested track, that was not on the playlist. The ads are infuriating in content and condescending. 0/10 I'm getting Tidal."
"Downloads don't work offline, play button on podcast episode description page won't even work and I uninstalled and reinstalled the app which didn't fix the issue. It claims you can listen for 30mins after watching an add but that's often a lie, every 2-3 songs (of max 5mins) there's and add. The browser version on Brave desktop is so much better than the buggy app."
"This app totally sucks, and after every two songs it plays an ad (not even kidding anymore, I counted) I swear if I have to hear another ""Mac'donalds old guy trying to seduce you with chikin"" ad I'm gonna snap ""Get you're crispy... juicy... m o i s t.. chicken sandwich today... I promise you'll be left satisfied"" I have to hear this with top-grade, noise cancelling headphones with amazing sound quality... I hate it. I feel like a male stripper who is obsessed with chicken is trying to seduce me"
The features and changes made to the app always sabotage the user experience. Why would new downloaded podcast episodes go in the music section? THEY WERE FINE IN THE DOWNLOADS SECTION. Jfc the UI decisions made are terrible.
With the last update there are couple of bugs appeared. 1-) even with good connection it says no connection and even though it says it and all the songs are greyed out you can still play the song. 2-) there is no library button so it is impossible to view playlists.
How? How did you end up making the UI even worse than before? Can no longer at a glance see whats download and how many songs are listed. Still cannot partially download albums. The app now has a all in one library screen with terrible filtering. Clicking an artist now takes you to an artidt page instead of what is saved in library. Why would I need to always see the top 5 every time I click an artist? App is now designed to almost always pester you with recently played
"Great service, terrible app. It is very slow, crashes often, and sometimes it doesn't load the songs you have already downloaded (it often happens when you update the app). Spotify Lite is good but isn't perfect either. Well, it's sad to see that we're stuck with an app that works great on MacOS and Linux, but doesn't perform so well on Android. I've been a subscriber since forever, but that's kind of annoying."
"Totally loved it at first, but then the app broke completely for me. Some of the setting features, show all unplayable songs, corrupted my account on Spotify to making everything unplayable. It also corrupted it on pc for me too, I tried to access support and it would not do that. Spotify really need to work on this and stop adding features that ruin your experiences. Being a premium member I am disgusted that I am paying for this stuff. I will now be going to YouTube. Fix this Apple!!!"
Terrible.... Download button on playlists is not showing there anymore...I have premium account...I have to download songs one by one... awful experience... Spotify developers fix this please....
"They ruined mobile Playlists, adding songs you never wanted onto them, its extremely annoying and ruins the experience| edit: ALSO NOT TO MENTION YOU CANT EVEN PLAY THE GOD DAMN SONGS YOU WANT WITHOUT SHUFFLING, THIS IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING, THE APP IS RUINED."
"Broken. I asks if I want 30 minutes of no ads if I watch a video, I say ""watch video"" or whatever the button is, then it plays 4 (annoying) ads immediately and more ads in 15 or 20 minutes 🙄😡👎"
"This App sucks. Each time i try to play a song i want to play, the play button does not appear and when i try to shuffel, IT PLAYS A SONG THAT WAS NEVER IN MY PLAYLIST! This feature should be removed, untill it is removed, my opinion stays the same."
I have to reinstall Spotify daily due to the app freezing and playing the wrong songs. The buttons also lose functionality during this issue. Using on a S20.
I still hope and wait for an update that it will fix spotify for about 3 months already but no sign of that.The app moves terible when I press the play button nothing happens and it receive my comand of playing/stoping after 1 minute please repair your app.
"Newest update is horrible. I pay for premium but have no access to any of my podcasts now. I really expected this to have been fixed quickly, but it's been about a week, and nothing."
"After a recent update, there are so many bugs! It's embarrassing that I pay for this. Playing music screen is frozen and doesn't change. Pause button doesn't work. Keeps playing music after disconnecting headphones! Get it sorted Spotify!!!"
New UX update is such garbage I'm going to have to switch to Pandora. Download a podcast episode for later? Better make you scroll through every episode ever released to be able to listen to it. Good thing it's so complex now it takes 5 minutes to load more than 3 episodes in the list. Terrible
"This app is... okay. Every time i get on spotify I want to listen to a specific song, but i can't. I also am not able to pay to remove these. Also you guys removed the loop feature??? i really want the loop button back so i can listen to my favorite songs on loop. Fix this and maybe I'll raise my review."
Auto plays in the car even when it's toggled off. I do NOT want my spotify playing everytime I get into my car UNLESS I open the app. The options are selected to NOT auto play yet it does. I have searched many forums and I am about to be yet another person who unsubscribed because of this SUPER ANNOYING BUG ISSUE you have had for years. Going back to pandora at least it stayed quiet when I needed it. So simple...
Updated the app to its newest version and now when I try to share anything to Instagram stories it just opens the camera. I've tried all the fixes I could find on Google. And if my songs are downloaded I shouldn't require cellular or wifi service to listen to them. Yet it stops playing or I cant even click on songs until I go into offline mode in low service areas. Fix your app.
Good platform and good range of music. Majority of things are good on it. But one annoying bug at the moment is where the current song shows an old song that I was playing and doesn't show the actual song I'm playing. Force quitting the app doesn't work and it will randomly fix itself but its a constant occurrence. Fix your app
The app stops my podcasts frequently for no reason making me have to go back to my phone and press play again. Also the 15 forward and back buttons do not work. They leave you in random places. I pay for this service and it is not worth it so far.
"I want a music streaming app that I can also use on my laptop. When I use Spotify on my M1 Apple MacBook Air quite often it won't play songs or albums. I contacted Spotify support a lot about this. Some of their suggestions were good ideas but overall the quality of support was really bad, including asking me to log in to a test account for which they had given me details that didn't work. In the end I had to leave Spotify and join Apple music. Perhaps Spotify doesn't work on Apple silicon."
"It's a hoax. We have to watch add oftenly, which is quite understandable. But app restrict from listening to songs which I like and make me to listen to singer's albums only which have limited allocations to skip. What a joke. Who want to listen to songs which we don't like to listen. And why have to throw money for that as well. It's so unethical. Uninstalling the app. Be fair to the user."
"Bad design, Bad code, Takes up extreme space on both desktop and mobile version. Bad audio quality, Cant even find playlists. The only reason i even downloaded this app in the first place was cause of the fact that it shows as your status in discord, But apparently that feature doesnt work sometimes too, So the app is just bad in general. Use a free music app like ""free music"" cause theres no premium and it gains profits through ads."
Was perfect. And then the new update rolled out. Now you can't play the song tou want straight away. You have got to press the skip button until the song is found.
All the songs you can find is amazing but the repeat button is gone and the controls are so confusing now other wise this is a good app.
"New update completely ruins the app. Library, which is what I assume most people access their content is now a muddled mess. I don't know why they decided to merge the music and podcasts sections. spotify is horrible for listening to podcasts, now its even WORSE. Whoever came up with this new update needs to be fired."
"Overall poor experience. App requires a long time to load, if it even does at all. Crashes frequently the now playing feature constantly lists that old songs are playing."
"Spotify adds ""songs that you'll enjoy"" to a playlist that you specifically only want to have 1 song in and nothing else, not to mention that when you click a song in a playlist you can't loop it and instead have to either listen to the whole playlist to get to the song you want, or just every 3 minutes hit the back button to restart the song you want."
"It does not work for me IDK why. I have good internet speed, enough storage, android 8.1 and I have no problem opening the app amd choosing songs. The problem is that the song wont play, even when I touch the play button it stays in 0:00. I would try move a secondor min but it wont play the audio though the lyrics change according to the time say I start the song in 1:20 lyrics change accordingly, the song is not paused but the audio wont play it still shows 1:20 though the song is not paused"
"It's an ad aap rather than music. Stop audio advertising for subscription, start giving images overloaded with ads , we don't mind. Don't break continuity while listening. Otherwise you will be useless app one day. Mark my words"
"At first, i love this app. Easy to use and have a million song that i love. I use a premium account so i won't bothered by ads. But suddenly, i hate this app because volume suddenly spiking to max without touching the volume button. I tried re-installing but it won't work. Trying to find solution on google but can't find anything usefull or work. Please fix it!"
Worst App ever!!!!! Music quality and everything were super and awesome.But there are just too many ad's. There will be three ad's followed by two songs. Only suitable for premium users.
"The most garbage thing I've ever owned and I've owned a beta max, a flowby, and Enron stock. This app is anxiety. Im an idiot and even I could build a better app than this. You should be ashamed of yourself for unleashing this on humanity. Good luck listening to anything for more than a minute. Countless uninstalls and reinstalls. I want my time back!"
Please fix the podcast side of the app. It is painfully counter intuitive and extremely frustrating. I pay for spotify premium and really want to use the app for listening to podcasts but it is completely unusable. I listen to half a podcast and then listen to music. I then attempt to listen to the podcast again and it has completely disappeared. I have to search for the podcast again. Why is there no 'listening history' section to allow me to quickly continue where I left off? Please innovate.
"- the current playing list ux is bad, it only shows songs coming next and not the ones that were previously listened to. Also, it does not have the album art on the list items - the shuffle and repeat song preference automatically change to default whenever I play any song from my favorites"
"Inherently designed to make downloaded music fail (SD card, login failures, etc...) making it impossible to use in offline mode seriously. So, in essence, requires a permanent online connection to broadband, or just occasional small downloaded playlists. Seeing how long such problems and 'glitches' have existed it's easy to see this is by design, rather than incompetence. As reinstalling the app is always the solution to all problems, you ALWAYS lose what you have downloaded."
The app keeps closing itself and stops playing songs randomly after I got the new update. It has become a large nuisance and I can hardly play 5 minutes of music without having this issue.
"I can't seem to share any songs to Instagram Story. It kept glitching. Whenever I press share Instagram, it directed me to their story camera, instead of showing the songs I've shared. In worse case scenario, it doesn't even bring me to Insta. Instead, it stayed at Spotify. It's quite frustrating ever since I updated to its recent version."
"I have a premium subscription. But there's still glitches where the music plays but the song title and the lyrics are completely wrong. The app bugs out as well. Same thing happens to not just my new android phone, the same happens on my laptop and ipad as well. Please fix it. Also, please bring back the previous album wallpaper for sharing stories in instagram. The new one is so ugly... Who the hell designed that?"
Well...My rating out of 5 stars says it all...🙄😹....Like the ads....it's soo annoying that it'll ruin your day..Id say either dwnld another app or just download songs...cuz the ADS in this thing is unbearable... First I thought of getting subscription..but becuz of their f- ing ads....I'm gonna delete the app....🙂
"App barely works, so slow I often just listen to the radio or silence. Loading screen ""loads"" to a blank page 10% of the time. Obviously not designed for someone who wants an organized collection of their favorite music. Can't believe I'm paying every month for disappointment, Google Play music was a great app and Spotify is second rate garbage for the same price"
If the wifi cuts out while you're listening to a podcast with video the entire playback fails requiring a force quit of the app in settings even if you have ample mobile data. Also please make the 3 dot button required to open a songs menu LARGER. I constantly hit the scroll bar on accident when trying to queue songs.
Premium member. Constantly stopping and starting my tracks. Very frustrating. No problems with any of my other music applications. Update required to fix bugs.
Pay for premium but the app is so buggy I can't even listen. Freezes before it opens. Freezes if you try to change Playlist. Freezes randomly while playing. Freezes and the music keeps playing even after a force quit.
"The ability to play any music in the world is a phenomenal luxury. What I hate is the fact that to do so comes at the price of being forced to see Spotify propaganda and ads that have nothing to do with anything pleasant about the world. Spotify is a constant reminder of what's wrong with the world. No one wants to see messages about ""black history month"" or ""Asian hate"", apparently, which didn't exist before Spotify. It's a foreign company telling you what America's problems are."
The app works fine on my computer but when I try and play one of my play lists on my phone I can't listen to any of them without shuffle play getting in the way. I don't have the money to afford premium and I can't figure out how to turn the stupid thing off. And I have my songs in a certain order and shuffle play ruins that. I need help here
Such a terrible UI for trying to watch podcasts. At first it was actually impossible and now that it is it is constantly buggy and damn near impossible. Good Job with helping tank what use to be one of the best podcasts on the internet. Money well spent!
"I can't listen to playlists quietly. While playing the songs that I like, there are suggested songs that are appearing and I can't get them out. It's frustrating because those songs aren't good at all. There are ads too. Imagine having 3 long ads just for 1 song then have 3 ads again. And a friend also told me that she had other experience on this app. I don't think this is a good app. I just want to listen to songs quietly. Everyone recommended me this but it sucks. So disappointed"
"I was logging in without a password and it sent me an email ofc but when I clicked the button on the email ot said the link expired, even though in the email it says it takes 4 hours to expire, and I clicked the link before that time limit. I can't log in."
"I pay for the premium option on this app and mostly when I try to use it, it does not work correctly and will not play music. Will probably stop paying premuim and delete app if things continue. I've paid over 50 dollars for aggravation."
"So many bugs, each requires a re-install to fix. Music stops in the middle (with good connectivity / downloaded content), songs won't change to next ones in queue. In addition, queues should have the possibility to keep played songs on the queue, this way one can go back to previously played songs (!!!)"
Since last update this app worth nothing; can't access my lists; it offline mode went to premium before... New design looks also pretty bad. Not using it anymore... Just popped in to say change it back; its really bad atm.
"The worst app in existence. It has so many problems that I am genuinely surprised when it works. It crashes, lags, double plays with impunity. The best term to describe it is ""gross."""
"The past few weeks, Spotify stops playing and quits after about 15-20 minutes of using. This is happening during every use of the app."
"Has been FULL of bugs for the last 6-9months or so... it was at its best around 2014 when I first became a member -Frequently crashing -Songs skipping -Songs not playing when [play] is tapped -Songs not pausing when [pause] is tapped -Songs continuing to play after app crashes -The play button lagging so it flips and becomes the pause button -Skipping to the next song and the album cover still being the one from the last song The heart button is too easy to hit on accident, thus unfavoriting."
This app was amazing until I started facing problems it doesn't even play songs on my phone. I just tap play button though the timeline moves but song doesn't plays. Completely worthless.. and do please rectify this issue!
Absolute garbage. Basically doesn't work for and I pay for it. It crashes all the time or doesn't play music. It requires you to clear the cache every day and its a pain to sign back in.
I’ve been organizing my library with folders spending a lot of time and now I can’t play a folder that contains several playlists. Tidal and SoundCloud are going to beat them... /// Tardas la vida en organizarte las playlist en carpetas y te quitan el botón para reproducir una carpeta... Tidal y SoundCloud les can a quitar el puesto rápido..
"Degrading free user experience just to make a cheap buck is not a good idea in my eyes. If you show 3 ads (In my case) after each song, then the listener will rather get frustrated and will leave Spotify and go to soundcloud instead of buying premium. They do not charge a buck and still give a nice adless experience. Even musixmatch is better than this. Why, then, do YOU charge money to get rid of ads? Make ad frequency as low as 1-2 ads per 5 songs and I think you might still make money."
Fix offline mode. It keeps saying I need to download the songs and once I connect to internet it's already downloaded. I always have to hunt for wifi which is quite annoying
"I switched to spotify after GPM ended. I like a lot about spotify overall, but their app for android is a massive dissapointment. There are long button delays in all facets of the app, often nearly 10 seconds long. The app randomly pauses the song I'm listening to, which is very disruptive to the experience. And this is all on my home wifi which registers avg speeds of 330mb/s. There's also no way to browse my personal library alphabetically. If I forget a song name, I cant browse by artist."
The ads are quite annoying to be honest.. and after ads they say you get 30 minutes of free music but after two songs there is another ad... like that is not 30 minutes worth of ad free songs.. 🤣🤦🏻‍♀️
Completely dissatisfied now with the app. After every song there are 2-3 ads. It's completely ruining my experience with Spotify as I was really into it. I sincerely not getting the point of irritating the customers and consumers at such level that they stop using the product eventually. I understand that advertising and marketing is important. But such desperation is making things worthless. It's simply turning my admiration of app into anger and hate. I request you to please change it.
"If you set up a Spotify account with stolen credit card details, once they are told of the fraud, Spotify will continue to perpetrate it by getting details of the replacement card and continuing to bill the victim. As the account belongs to the fraudster, Spotify offers no redress to the victim."
"i hate you spotify, im paying for you and you sneak adds in the middle of podcasts to ruin my listening expirence, after the adds play my podcast restarts for no reason, also podcasts restart for no reason without adds, i hope joe rogan leaves so i can just delete this app all together, i hate you spotify, i hate you, i hate you. also when issues occure while im driving, and its awful how there is potential for an accitent becasue you guys cant program an app. thx for nothin."
I don't know what happened but I can no longer log into my account. I've tried all known passwords and emails and nothing works. I don't even get an email for a new password despite the fact that it's required in the setup stage. I just want to listen to music while I game is that so hard to ask for!?
"Uninstalled the app as new advertisement for upgrading to premium membership of is quite disrespectful. It says ""you again came here to listen addvertisement.. all others have taken premium membership..you only left..if you don't take membership then in between soundtracks you have to listen my voice""....if you guys don't want people to listen songs/podcasts without payment..then stop them..dont embarass them for not taking your damn premium membership."
"It's quite horrible how you can't listen to a single song or playlist until you sign up for premium. And guess what? All my friends from the US or Europe can just use this app for free without paying. Is this application a joke? There isn't even a searching feature and litterally everything is for premium only. I've been waiting for spotify to be available in Korea for months, and I have to say I'm more than a little disappointed."
"Having issues with Volume Control: No matter what my media volume is, Spotify always set the volume for tracks on max. i tried decreasing it via button and sliding but it always ramp up automatically. Kinda unusable for me."
"So Spotify sucks! It'll ask you to create a premium account after a week or two and your songs will be played on preview for just a few seconds, you won't be able to listen to the entire song. Not everyone has the luxury to be a premium user. Could have been better."
"I have been using it for 1 month. But today i got some problem, If i want to play a music, then another music starts. I used to play music just by one click, but now I have to go inside, and then i clicked the play button, another music plays.... What's the problem?? Please fix this."
Plays random songs in prebuilt playlist. Wont let you skip more than 2 song. And 3 ads every other song. GARBAGE APP. Browser version is so much better.
"i used to love spotify, but now idk what happened to the algorithm that used to continually play songs based on my musical tastes, but now it doesn't work. when it does choose to work it plays the same 6 trendy ramone songs over and over but in different order each time. i might as well bluetooth an old cumsock and listen to music on that. i blame you guys' acquisition of joe rogans podcast."
"Used to be good, turned into absolute trash. Basically turned into cable tv - used to sell the fact there's no ads with a premium account, now ads are the thing that glitch out the entire system and make podcasts restart and I can't even listen to what I want to listen to. The only reason I paid for premium was to skip the ads, now the entire listening experience has been ruined by forcing you to listen through ads every 20mins. Lost yet another subscriber."
New update has made app unusable for podcast listening. You can no longer see feed of recently published podcasts. With the old library setup it was easy to see podcasts by release date and click on an episode for a quick description. Now it's time consuming to scroll through and try to find podcasts with new episodes.
"Nothing works, the app closes on its own every couple minutes. It never plays my downloads correctly, the pause button freezes. I can keep going."
"Used to use it to listen to k-pop since it had such a great gallery of artist i liked, and other music apps had most of the songs I love to listen to. My playlist is now very empty since they took a lot down, especailly one of my favorite artist. This was the only reason I actually paid for spotify premuim, though I will admit it has a good variety of songs, it is highly unlikely ill use/ buy spotify again."
I have been using spotify from quite a long time. I have gotten irritated from those adds if u guys want to listen to adds visit spotify and for songs some other app may be.
"Downloaded app for a specific podcast. Hit the pause button, hit play again, now the audio stacking creating a strange delay reverb that is unlistenable. Restarting the app does nothing. Pretty pathetic for what should be a thoroughly developed app with tons of funding. 👎👎👎👎"
"App design is nice, without premium, its useless. Cant skip more than 6 songs per hour, some songs need spotify premium, playlist layout isnt clear, way too many adverts, better off on soundcloud or even downloading music."
"""Update''- so they stole money from ME ""AGAIN"" for the 2nd time by charging for premium services and then not even upgrading me to premium!!! STOP TAKING MY MONEY FROM ME OR I'M GOING TO GET A LAWYER AND START A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT!!(Spotify stole money off my bank card screwing up some other bills I had set up to pay to which now I have to pay return fees! Beware people. Because even after you cancel the still takes money off your card and they DO NOT HAVE A WAY TO CALL THEM AT ALL!!! 😡😡)"
hi how about you guys settle whatever business disagreement you have quick and give us back our music ???? there's no reason to make so many songs inaccessible to international users ??????? also have been asking for the issue with the app crashing when you tap the menu button to be fixed for over a year now but with no results gonna switch to another music streaming app at this point lol save yourselves the trouble if you're using umidigi
App is bad. Interface is clunky. Not intuitive at all. Have to reinstall the app several times to get through a podcast.
"A lot of bugs, cant play the jre without losing my place multiple times, ill open the app and press play and it will play from a part i already listened to, and sometimes i tap the play button and nothing happens have to close the app and try again."
"Horrible App. I worked hours to gather my favourite songs into a playlist and when I played the list where playing songs that were not added by me/unknown, songs that I don't like, hardly you find some of the songs you want not everything you want, you can't press next/skip more than 6 times in an hour, has a lot of adds, you can't hold on the cursor of the song and move it forward or jump a sequence, some of the artists and songs I couldn't find them at all, you can't delete account no button."
"Super buggy app, won't let me watch many Joe Rogan podcasts for some reason. Other podcast work I half the time. This used to be a great app. But now that they are trying to do video its gone down hill quickly."
"Used to be a great app, but Spotify ruined it by aggressively pushing podcasts. There is no option to remove the podcasts, and not to mention, the intrusive tracking used to suggest podcasts."
"Why isn't there an option to view history? Whenever I'm listening to a podcast and want to continue it another day, I have to play from the beginning and spend some time figuring out where I left last time. Also, the widget on notification bar and lock screen should have a seek button instead of next button when listening to podcasts. I'm listening to a 3 hour long podcast and then press next by mistake and then have to open the previous podcast back up and again figure out where I left..."
"Spotify's UI for Videos is horrible... It's difficult to go fullscreen, it's a pain to get the video controls off the screen and it's just overall clunky. JUST COPY YOUTUBE'S APP! Then this is a 5star review"
"Quite an interesting app... You pay $12.99 a month for a ""Premium"" subscription with NO ADDS, but then your forced to listen to adds no matter what. I would highly avoid giving this company any of your money. Stick with your other streaming services or use the free version if you must use it at all. 1/10."
"Literally false advertising in the title, despite it saying 'listen to podcasts' first thing they are unavailable in certain regions even for premium members. Really reconsidering continuing the subscription."
I used to love this app but here lately all it's been is very glitchy and I have an ad after every single song. Its honestly quiet annoying since I'm supposed to have a 30 hour of ad free music yet all I have is ads
"Wow this app is full of bugs songs stop playing, volume auto changes, some buttons don't work what the hell are the developers doing this app is trash now, do not install it i repeat DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP!!!!"
"Was great until the last few updates. Randomly stops playing, doesn't load song info just stays on previous song, status bar and lock screen controls don't appear, won't load playlists, playing songs is hit and miss online and offline and quite a few more issues especially after last update. May unsub if it doesn't get fixed as I'm not wasting money on something that doesn't work."
"terribly bad. I'm not sure what happens with the current update but whenever I typed my song that I want to listen, it never played and jump to shuffle play which only asked you to upgrade to premium. Quickly uninstalled it!"
Cant cancel. I have new Email address. Old one was hacked and cant access it. There is no cancellation button. You make it impossible to cancel. I have new email and started a new account and was wanting to transfer account but you making it this difficult to cancel I'm not sure. Spotify please contact me.
I'm a college student and I have the habit of working while listening to music but it's my worst experience cuz after every second song 2 Or 3 ads appear that ruins my flow. WORST!!!!
"If you don't have premium, this app is garbage. Edit: even if you have premium the app is garbage... So many playback errors. I am quite disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high, but these flaws make it really hard to rate this app."
"The only problem I have is with viewing albums. I have been try for two days to listen to the wings of fire albums by Tui T. Sutherland, and any time I tap on the albums it doesn't show the stories. This is very frustrating. Please fix it, I have restarted my phone 3 times so I know it's not my phone."
"Used to love Spotify and never had a problem until about 3-4 months ago. Now, I would give it less than 1 star if i could. Music stops randomly, or won't even start playing. I have Uninstalled and reinstalled app, still no improvements. Problems still happen even when I got a brand new phone (Samsung S20 note) If this isn't fixed quickly I'll be canceling my subscription."
I have a Galaxy S 20 Ultra and i listen eith Bose quiet comfort 35IIs. There are so many bugs while listening to podcasts where it just stops playing and it goes back to the last time you paused/played the video. Its so stupid and beyond annoying..... Its now February and its been updated and its just somehow worse... Now music also just randomly stops and i still get ads while listening to podcasts even though i am paying for premium. Listening downloaded music won't work while offline
"Transfered from deezer at the start of the year. Whole app is slow, delays on buttons and music randomly restarting. Want to keep with spotify but rn considering moving back to deezer"
"Hold off on paying for Premium. Should you even download this app? Definitely not in its current version. This used to be a great app (I've been a Premium sub. for years!). In the last 3 weeks, though, the app is unusable. Plays 15 seconds, then silence. Force stopping helps for 1 song, then silence again. Restarting the device, updates&all the other commonly known tricks aren't helping. If this issue is solved quickly, I'll gladly change the rating. For now 1 star. Extremely disappointing."
What even happened to this app. Why can't I listen to a song in particular instead of the whole damn album? It used to be great before but I'd say it's deteriorated into a mess. To add insult to injury now you can't play your liked songs? How can anyone justify that? Plus you can't even return to a previous track. It's kind of spiralling out of control. I'm genuinely considering switching to another music streaming service.
Sux. I can only hear playlists on shuffle but on PC I can hear it how I want. Here I cant infinitely skip but I can on the PC version. I now prefer soundcloud more than this mess of ads and asking for buying Premium.
"Having a lot of issues. Songs not playing, app constantly hangs, tells me I am offline even though I am not. Have been a premium subscriber for quite sometime but for last 3 weeks, this has been the most annoying app I have used."
"In this new update I can not choose what I want to listen to on my Playlist and now skipping songs are a premium feature?! Update, my Playlist gets more added by an ai, WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING?! It's a stupid idea to do this and that just makes me [MORE] angry, -100/5 ruined by [MORETHAN JUST A] stupid executive."
Terrible. Audio constantly pauses when running in background. There is no play/pause button unless you have the app open and even then it doesn't work. Honestly amazed at how bad this is and the ONLY reason I continue to use it is for the JRE podcast. It's shameful.
"Why is it i have to be scared once updating this app.. hoping it doesn't get worse. Please don't malform old versions to make new versions Required. I might work for the spotify company just so they don't plummet. all the creators that make their app viable I love you, those who put up with spotify to listen I envy you. Everyone who wants it to be greater than this I have hope for your ideals. But it seems to out of touch' in every way, making this a shambling mess for people."
"Everything changed when the premium appeared.I can't choose my song everytime I tapped on the playlists.Plus,I can't change the song by myself which when a song finished, it will changed to a RANDOM song. Please let us use this app freely without premium version.Downloaded the lite version too and thought it came without the premium thing but it's still the same dude. It was said this app is a free one which is liar! Now,we have to pay monthly to listen musics!Fix this quickly!I'll try Tidal now"
Will give more stars once they find issues. Overall pretty good. Been a premium member for quite a while now. The main thing that irritates me is watching the JRE podcast but i want the video to see the interactions between joe and his guests! Can only get audio *garbage* been watching JRE on youtube for years without any problem! A shame you paid the best podcast 100mil and then short the customer! Paying $10 a month i want the video coverage!! Can watch clips on youtube so there recording...
Censoring music and removing songs you don't agree with is not conducive to a good user experience. I've been a long time subscriber but am considering looking elsewhere.
"The streaming is kinda ok, but the app is terrible. It crashes a lot, takes a lot of space, and is wildly counterintuitive"
"This has to be a joke. When I play a song, a COMPELETLY different song plays. Not even related to the song. This has been happening for 1-2 months. It works very well on PC, but mobile is ruined. Please fix it."
the UI sucks. the play bar doesn't work. it plays audio when you don't and doesn't play when you want it to. don't get notifications of new podcasts
"The app is pure hot garbage. I've been a premium user for years, the app has only gotten worse over time. It's constantly slow to load anything, songs don't play, each UI update makes it less convenient to use, frequent UI glitches, downloads and artist radio sometimes disappear, and I am said to be offline despite having internet connection. Sometimes the app just refuses to work at all. The only redeeming quality is the service itself, otherwise one of the most pathetic apps I've ever used."
"Requires wifi to even play downloaded music for offline. Constant freezing and crashing. App barely functions, why do i even pay for premium when theres zero perks."
"I loved it, but the new update ruined it by making so you have to pay to listen to playlists and if you dont it plays songs that are related to songs in your playlist which is so stupid. It was great then trash, thanks greedy people."
"App is so buggy. Horrible UI. constantly loses where I left off in a podcast. Today I was at minute 400/86!!! Wat? Ever heard of unit tests??? I'd really like to be able to pause, hit play and come back AT THE SAME TIMESTAMP. Jeez... At this rate I'm moving to Tidal or Apple music. Pls hire decent developers Spotify. I pay from premium btw, no complaints about content or features. Just the fact the app is buggier than an entomologist's display case"
"Four ads, I am not kidding, four ads directly after each other. As if the limitations placed on the free version weren't enough, I can't comment on the premium version, but given that the prices vary significantly based on region I have no doubt that Spotify is trying to make as much money as is feasibly possible which might be a good business option, but leads to a terrible user experience and is therefore rated as such."
"Stops playing unprompted all the time, when you connect or disconnect from Bluetooth it brings the content back to random spot not where you left off, play button works when it feels like it."
"I don't recommend! Spotify has become worst app now because they force to buy premium and they should mark it available only after users will purchase premium as it is useless without it! Also many songs are not available on Spotify, in playlist back button doesn't work, they should fix the application errors! Really bad experience after using this app :("
"So many useful features have been stripped away, even after inquiring about them. App is declining, fast This may even just be for Android OS, but the ability to slide down to search your entire Liked-song library now takes several taps with LOADING times. My biggest frustration because it was the fastest way to search MY library, not all of spotify. Never got lyrics back. And the genius lyrics are awful too, it's so one tracked. Not to mention the business model... Pay your artists..."
This is so broken atm. What ever song I am playing its pulling the details and pics from another list. Can't see where the song is up to on the progress bar. It also randomly stops playing and thwn sometimes keeps playing when closed. Pause/ play does not indicate and this all affects the app on my Gear fit with the same visual errors. In addition the new app on my Gear fit it terrible. Why to I have to going in and open the app to then use the player dropdown. Not intuitive at all.
"The app has changed so you cannot listen to the songs you want because you have to shuffle the playlist to find the songs you want. You can only skip 6 songs every hour without the premium I am currently uninstalled the app I am very upset that my favourite music app has been ruined by its developers thank you for your service please be sure to take note of my 1 star and be inspired by it for your further reviews of this app Apologies, Frank"
"Horrible user experience for the arguably largest music platform. How can such a large profile, large budget company not manage to create a fluid and swift app is completely beyond me. The menus are slow. The animations slow things down further. No EQ on a music player??? Cmon. You can't even select multiple tracks at a time for queuing. It's the only app on my device with an active subscription, and it's also the worst app on my phone."
"This is such an annoying experience, the app would just stop playing all of a sudden until you press any button (power, volume) to turn up the phone back light. It'd start playing the moment you press any button but wouldn't ask your permission before stopping unnecessarily. This has been happening for months even after purchasing a premium plan."
I actually think the audio quality is ZERO!!! I listen to songs with a headphone and i cant hear the beat peacefully until i pressed the button on my mike. I even bought a new headphone thinking that it broke and i wasted my money😩😩😩😩. Pls dont use this app. Its useless. And the buying premium is even WORSER!!! This app sucks
"New update is awful. I hate the screen for when you're listening to a song. I loved seeing the art and now there is no '...' button on the song screen to be able to add it to a playlist or go to artist, etc. Really impractical"
"For an app that I pay for, the experience is hampered by problems. Smart watches can't auto connect unless you have your phone open and on Spotify, the play button often doesn't work at all. Sometimes when music is played, the buttons and the song duration bar freeze, and only a force shutdown fixes it. These require an immediate fix, and I have no clue why they haven't noticed this yet."
very nice best music app you will love it 🖤 . I have given app a 5 star rating but now I just can't bear more I have purchased Spotify premium for 1 month and It was all good but now I am getting ads just after every 2 songs which is really annoying my friends who have not purchased premium a single time are getting least ads but me it not like that I feel like spotify is pushing me to buy premuim beacuse it knows I can buy but this is not okay I am going to leave this app after sometime
"Terrible App. Requires repeated forced stops and resets just to troubleshoot basic navigation, load playlists, play music, and open menus."
"Full of botters and fake accounts, ruins the app all discover music sections filled with fake music. No sign of fixing this issue, records of people experiencing this since 2018. Swapped to YT music offer a much better service"
"Playback cuts out at random frequently. UI constantly out of sync with playback. Can't choose to stream podcasts in audio only. Options in settings are very lacklustre. Can't customise the home screen or get rid of playlist garbage which I have no interest in using. For a premium service app with the resources of a big company, it's pretty rubbish."
"They are so lucky there isn't any competition. This app is so slow, the UX is so confusing, and over time expect a huge cache to build up on your phone or computer."
"Pretty much garbage unless you want to pay the $10 a month subscription. Like I can live with the shuffling of an album if I'm a free user, and can live with the ads. but, the fact that I can't even go 3 songs before I start getting songs from different album or artist entirely kinda ruins the service."
"Terrible, user experience which has gotten gradually worse to a point were the app is freezing multiple times a day on a top of the line Samsung. No point downloading songs cause you can't even play them off-line the app doesn't load without internet, so disappointing paid customer for almost 4 years, not sure what they are investing it on. Need to clean the app and reduce the clutter to improve user experience."
"The ads are worst thing in the app, I'm giving it one star because these ads ruin your mind. We listen songs to freshen up our mind but these ads make situation more worst. Now they'll reply that we will look into the issue bla bla bla........only remove the ads . One who came to listen the song is not interested to buy anything nor to take any subscription."
It's not good!! Came here for Joe Rogan but it wants to know too much info and crazy amount of advertisements!! 7 ads before the podcast plays along with tons more during the podcast. Go back to YouTube Joe so I dont have to deal with this very intrusive and horrible app!! I already downloaded it but if you are hesitant just dont do it!! I'm stuck with them sending me emails about this dumb app and I've quit using it now.
"Tried the duo premium but it keeps going back to the free subscription. Tried some guides on the internet but none worked. I decided to cancel the premium but couldn't find the ""cancel premium"" button suggested by internet guides. Not much help can be found in the spotify support section either."
"It's great if you never pause or hit the 15 sec back button... stupid app keeps jumping back to the same spot on a podcast regardless of how far ahead I have already listened when paused or rewinding 15 seconds. Functionality with earbuds pause/play is spotty and unreliable, regardless of brand... thanks but I'm going to use this app only for Rogan since most everyone else is available on Sticher etc"
"HATE this stupid app. Been searching for alternatives tonight. Works only when it bloody feels like it which is 20% of the time. Same reports as other users. Glitchy, slow, doesn't connect to bluetooth well, won't play songs/podcasts, quits itself randomly etc etc. I fight with this stupid app every day. In QLD, we now get a $1000 fine if caught touching our phones while driving so you can imagine how thrilled I am when Spotify quits itself while I'm in the car. Hate it."
"Absolute garbage. Wont let me play the songs i want to play. I click on my friends album to give it a listen press play and instead its juice wrld or justin bieber. I didnt click on that, i clicked on my friends albums. Then they tell me i only get 6 skips per hour when one of his songs that i already heard shows up. I would never pay for premium on something that functions like trash. Save yourself the trouble and get apple music if you plan on paying for music, spotify is not user friendly."
"Just a shockingly bad app. Freezes and locks up, not super Intuitive, lacks basic features like play history. I just don't get how such a popular service like Spotify can consistently drop the ball like this. It should be sleek, amazing, always improving... But instead we get this jalopy."
"It's been like 3 years and there is still problems with the app interacting with the internet. Why does it take so long (or never) load when you're trying to access an offline playlist. Also the options menu is seriously annoying to access in a playlist/list of songs, the scroll bar is touched way too often instead of the menu button. By menu button I mean the 3 dots to either add to playlist or queue. From a Samsung S10 user. Same problems on my ""offline phone"" HTC One."
"Horrible free user experience, forces users to pay just to listen to a specific song. Ads are fine every now and then but removing the ability to listen to a specific song is a money hungry crash grab attempt."
"This app performs terrible on Android. I'm a paying subscriber, and use Spotify as my main music/podcast platform. It opens quickly, but the search and play functions take an eternity to respond. Even where songs and podcasts are downloaded, the Spotify app can take five to 10 minutes to begin playing. There is, as far as I know, now workaround for this. My wife has an iPhone (and is also a paid subscriber) and has never had this issue. The shuffle, it has to be said, is also rubbish."
"Buggiest app I have, always having issues playing music but the app doesn't reflect that, Android auto issues, forcing me to force quit. Very disappointing for such a big company"
"As to my experience so far it's not much different from the desktop version, the only difference is that people that lost their ability to pay for premium services, have now been stabbed in the back and forced to have voice ads interrupt their listening experience which I imagine makes you lose quite a few patrons that would have possibly returned, and may still return if you quit doing it!!"
"App freezes constantly on Note S20 Ultra. I recently got this new phone and it seems as soon as One UI 3.0 installed on the phone this app is extremely buggy, freezing, crashing a lot. Please fix the bugs Spotify!"
"Why does bringing on the Joe Rogan Podcast mean I can't listen to downloaded music or podcasts. Spotify had months to prepare. Also, if I wanted to watch video podcasts I would use an app That streamed video. Quit doing too much... Update: it's gotten worse"
"I don't have premium. I was listening to some song today, wanted to listen it from start now. 15s ad. Song doesn't start from start but continues to play where I left it. Okay, I press again to replay. 15s ad. It didn't again from start. I press replay. Again 15s ad. I've heard more ads today than songs. Too much ads, would be nice if ads appear after a few songs, this reactive ads are killing app. Feels like you've spent more time developing your app for ads than user experience."
"I am a premium subscriber and lately the android app became a complete disaster. It stops mid-song, searching sth takes ages. The most annoying, I cannot switch between devices on my phone anymore! If I was listening on my pc and left that room, I cannot even play anything on my phone. You require URGENT fix Spotify, otherwise I cannot see a reason to pay!"
Before the New Year Spotify free version had three months trial and few advertisements. It was tolerable and friendly. Now they reduced it to one months free trial and really amped up the adverts with quite insulting content to some extent as if we don't have some intelligence. The service is brilliant in terms of everything available but the free version now is totally spoilt by the inundating level of adverts.
"The app is complete garbage and constantly refuses to play songs, drops the entire queue, etc. Should not be this difficult for a multibillion dollar company to design an app to play audio files"
The UI is completely unusable and overall just aneurysm inducing Trying to navigate this UI or even use it is the equivalent of going to a maze only to find out the entire maze is just one brick wall.
"Trying to find and listen to podcasts is one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Play/pause sometimes just doesn't work. Podcast timeline will freeze. And when you tap 15 sec forward or back it will skip from when the timeline froze. I download podcast episodes, but it will still buffer. Clicking follow on a podcast seems to mean nothing. If it does do something it is not intuitive. Faster to just search everytime."
"I am a premium subscriber and have been for many years. The app is a total disaster at the moment. Keeps saying I can't connect to the internet even though I'm connected or have full network, and most annoyingly doesn't seem to update with current podcasts episodes as quickly as other players. I've reinstalled the app so many times and nothing seems to help. Why am I paying per month for this?"
"Now a days it's giving a lot of ads, like in every 5 mins there is ad, before, it was like in every 20 or 30 minutes, but now it gives a lot of ads and ruins the whole mood."
"Pathetic app. Within 24 hours of signing up, i get an email that my password has been reset, and that I have to set a new password, and not the same as the original. I cant play songs. Have to listen to shuffled list, and I cannot sign up for premium because its ""not currently available"". Maybe hire some profesional UX people and stop delivering 'annoying-ware'"
"Yet another great app bites the dust with abject greed. Impossible to listen to it as a non-premium customer with incessant, disruptive, and long ads completely ruining the experience. Ads usually intrude every 4 mins of listening time and last for over a minute and half."
WAYYY too many ads I just want to enjoy music. But i cannot. ITS BECAUSE HALF OF THE TIME THERE ARE ADS PLAYING. Completely ruins the experience.
"Paid for premium when i saw it advertised as no ads and able to use Spotify on more than 3 devises but that is not the case, as only 1 device can be use at one time quite misleading in my opinion."
"I have been a premium user for years and the app was great at one time but it is horrible now. I'm so frustrated with it as nothing works. The audio and what is shown on the screen doesn't line up at all. For example, you can be listening to a song but the screen shows you a different song title. Even where you are in the song doesn't line. The play button is shown even though if you press it it actually pauses the song cut the song is already playing. Very glitchy app!"
"Terrible. The worst app I've ever used, bar none. Totally unintuitive. Who designed this thing? After the recent update it won't connect most of the time. I hate it so much - and my family hate the way I start throwing things around when I try to use it."
"Too many ads now. Even they said no ads for 30 minutes, but for every 2 songs ads now and that too in Hindi and so much irritating ads and voices. Once loved Spotify for its simple GUI and seamless streaming. Now without WiFi it's not at all working. Very bad in connection also. Also not much songs in Tamil collection also. Moving to other app."
"I expected a lot more from Spotify I'm on the free version, but usually, if the free version is good, you feel like getting the premium .....Spotify Free, does not inspire you to buy the premium The free version is filled with Ads, made by absolute amateurs, that have no sense of humor and are repeated till you feel like getting your sick bag out Shuffle does not work because it repeats the same songs, even though, you clicked the ""Shuffle"" button Pathetic App"
"Genuinely disappointed with this app. Coming from Google Play music (which is now shut down) I expected to enjoy Spotify. Instead I have only been frustrated and annoyed that there aren't basic things such as a ""songs"" category for your music, only albums and artists. There is no way to shuffle all of your downloaded music. Just not an option. Why? Who knows? The way it keeps the music queue works is just annoying once you want to listen to something different. If I had space here I could go on."
"This app was 5 atars until the recent update, because Ever since the update Spotify has a hard time playing on both my phone and my car. Either it doesn't play at all or it takes 5-10 mins to load. I try and restart my phone and sometimes this works and others times it doesn't. Debating on canceling my premium subcription, because these delays have resulted in me using Amazon Prime Mysic which uploads quick without issues. Please fix as I really enjoyed Spotify prior to the update!!!!"
"Premium is great, but when I can't afford the luxury, the free version is ridiculous. I wouldn't begrudge an ad or two, I get they need the revenue, but when I have to listen to 6 ads in a row before listening to a song I can't even choose specifically for myself, I draw the line. Not worth it."
"Only downloaded spotify to watch full episodes of joe rogan. Have premium, cannot figure out how to watch videos on the app at all. Followed the guide on their site and it was useless. Can only listen and not watch, what fun is that???"
"The older versions were really good, very easy to use, now they changed completely the design and I have encountered many problems, like the song playing stops for no reason and more"
"Recently it's not playing anything, it plays the adverts then the song looks like it's playing as has the pause button, but no sound comes out. Works on laptop, but not on phone. Installed and reinstalled many times, used someone else's login but nothing, no sound coming out. Yet YouTube music works and plays fine so not my phone speakers. Must be something wrong with the app, as had worked for months before now."
"Sorry, but I can quite safely say that this is a huge cash grab. Without premium not only do you get ads, but also lower audio quality, songs automatically added to your play list and you are forced to play on shuffle. Left the app because none of the other services do this."
"This is, without a doubt, the absolute WORST big-name app I have ever had to use in my entire life. I cannot fathom the programming choices made for this app, what the software engineers at Spotify are thinking I have no idea. Why on EARTH does it keep INSISTING on using the internet to retrieve content I have already downloaded??? Shaky internet connection: album either takes four billion years to show up or it just gives up. Airplane mode: album shows up instantly. What IDIOT designed this????"
"Used spotify premium happily for years, however this is one of the worst apps I have ever used, it's hard to believe they actually want people to use their service it is so totally unbearable. Constant issues trying to load things, app crashes, songs not starting or pausing randomly or even showing up as the wrong song entirely. Genuinely one of the most frustrating apps I've ever had the displeasure of using."
"this app used to be so good and intuitive, now i can't edit the queue, i can only listen to playlists on shuffle (who tf thought that listening to 'previews' in playlists was a good idea?) it's just overall harder to use and more frustrating. I'm considering switching back to an older version tbh"
"I can't believe how much Spotify sucked. Even with paying for it there's adds in the podcasts, they don't have a quarter of the bands I like, the app isn't intuitive and it's not at all clear what's downloaded. I am seriously disappointed after all of the hype."
"I'll bump my review once you fix this app. Why is it when your phone is unplugged the app just quits for no reason? Very annoying. If it keeps up, I'm unsubscribing from your service. If you're paying, you should expect it to work."
"Why the heck, can i not view all songs - from opening an artist menu? Why isn't this an option from the artist menu? Why do I have to search that particular artist into the search menu, then go to ""see all songs"" as a drop down? This is a serious flaw! UX needs to be updated!"
"Way too many ads!! Back to back 2-3 ads between every 2-3 songs. It's like one song per ad. And why am I getting Hindi ads when the language preference I've selected is only Tamil and English? Doesn't Spotify know to categorize ads even based on language? I don't even understand half the ads I get. Sheer waste of an app! All their build quality is being wasted because of the excessive, annoying amount of ads! Will never subscribe to premium no matter how much you force us to!"
"Suddenly the app stopped playing songs!! Its is so annoying, the play button is on, but still the songs aren't being played!! Please fix! @spotify"
"One of the worst apps I've encountered. There is no playback in my drop down menu to pause or resume, it pauses randomly every 5 to 10 mins, when I open app the minimised control buttons dont work, cannot pause with my headphone button but can resume when it pauses itself go figure, when the app is open and I pause in the fullscreen controls leave app and go back the podcast is back at the start. These basic control functions shouldn't be an issue, even free media apps work better."
"Love to tell you that you're getting 30mins of ad-free music for watching an ad on the free version before bombarding you with about ten ads over the next 30mins, literally without fail & every time. Absolute joke. The shuffle play button may as well be the ""play the exact same string of songs you play every other day"" button too."
"App doesn't work properly, whenever I try to play an song it doesn't play it just pause on that place most of the Playlist doesn't even open and say that no connection but my device is well connected to internet and other apps which require internet are working properly. This problem started few days ago. Please fix this asap Thanks"
"Over the top user limitations have ruined the app. I have to shuffle and skip/play god knows how many damn songs just to listen to that one song I want to listen to. I Can't just open the app and listen to what you want, gotta go through the whole damn playlist 1 song at a time just to get to the one you want to listen to. It's not like this bs on the PC though. I can understand the ads and I rather have ads over not being able to pick the songs I want to listen to."
This app absolutely sucks. Considering I pay for a premium membership I dont get to use it most of the time because it freezes up all the time. Fix it or im discontinuing my membership and moving to the next best thing.
"I'm changing my old rating, the apps gone very down for me. It doesn't show my liked songs and every time I press the like button nothing happens, no heart, nothing. it deleted all my liked songs and won't let me put it back into the liked playlist which is now non completely gone for me.when I search an artist it does not let me go into their profile but tells me theres no connection, after doing a test everything about my wifi is good and my playlist are playable.Reinstalling did nothing"
I've been having alot of issues as the app randomly pauses and the play button often doesn't work and doesn't display the correct track that I'm playing
"I've used Spotify for years but something has happened recently that is freaking me out. Sometimes im not even listening to Spotify and my Alexa will start playing some weird music. I thought it was just Alexa but tonight I put Spotify on to help me sleep, it was 1 min into a song the song and then the weird songs started playing. All updates are done, cache clear. The songs aren't even on my playlist, liked by me or followed. Really ruining my Spotify experience."
Too many continues ads in this app.Jio saavn is far better than Spotify.And sometimes the songs doesn't load quickly(even if my net is on it shows you're offline)and I have to exit the app and open it again evertime.
"This app sucks for podcasts. I had to switch because JRE is going to be exclusive. I downloaded a dozen podcasts and every time I get too far away from the wifi router it stops playing a tries to buffer. EDIT: the steps suggested by Spotify did not work at all, and now I'm getting ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PODCAST!!! This is directly against what Rogan's been saying for SEVEN YEARS. Spotify sucks and it's ruining JRE."
"This app is hard to navigate, controls are unintuitive, playlist recommendations aren't very good, and there's bugs/quirks everywhere. People pay money for this??"
"Awful user interface. Terrible recommendations, constant interruptions. Really poorly designed app. Any other music streaming app would be 1000x better."
"Worst app ever. I can't get a single song to play. If I could give negative ratings I surely would have given. If I click on the song to play it, I get to the screen such that the song will be played and the play button already pressed but neither the navigation bar shows any advancement nor the music is being played."
"The app was going along great up till a few months back. After a recent update the app required a log on, and wouldn't recognise the password. Used the ""send link to email"" function and every time the link is pressed it comes up with a message that the link is expired send another link (which never arrives). This is even after clicking on the link a few seconds after it arrives and the message on the link says it's valid for 4 hours."
"terrible.especially after the last update!Sometimes i cannot play any songs, it litterally just wont play, as if ii didnt click play button. On other occasions it will tell me i dont have internet connection, even though my signal is 100% and 100mb/s!I cant see songs in que list & it only adds one song at a time, even if you add a whole album!and forget about lisening/searching while the up updates ur playlist!ive been a premium member for 5 years, paying for what?? I seems its time for a change"
"I HAAAAAAAAAATE how it plays recommended songs, like idc what u think i might like. Just if u rly must recommend songs make ur own Playlist don't intrude on my already perfect and well suited for me Playlist. Like dude PUH leeeeeease I mean I'll be listening to a song that I like then another by the same artist will play and I'm like I ONLY LIKE ONE SONG BY THEMMMMMM. and I'll view my Playlist and itll have the songs I added and then below it's like: songs we added. GDTUCEYHDRUIHGHURRG FIX IT!"
It never really gives you a WHOLE 30 minutes without ads. And some times its like it knows when am trying to go sleep becuase it will give me like THREE ads every TWO songs. And the ads are sometimes really loud and i just wake up to some women yelling about something. And when it asks you watch this short video when you start listening to something and click the no button it eithers gets really bitchy and gives you like 6 ads or you get like 2 ads when your done with the first song.
"Until further notice spotify is ruined for me. With the changes they made today (being able to skip songs only a couple of times per day, not even being able to listen to the songs you want, etc.) I have decided not to use the app. By not being able to choose a song i mean when you want to listen to a specific song you have to go threw a random playlist, not being able to listen to that song until a few random songs go by that you had no desire to listen to."
"The ""Hide This Song"" and ""Remove From This Playlist"" buttons shouldn't be so easily accessible. Many times I've accidentally tapped those buttons, im sure other people have to."
"For a paid app, it is extremely laggy and full of bugs. Extremely frustrating when it won't load, or play songs even if they are downloaded. Ruins an otherwise great app and service."
"While it's a good app I have a lot of problems with it, 1) you can't choose what song you want to play??? Its makes so no sense! 2) it adds songs to your playlist and you can't delete them???? 3) the only allowing 6 skips and it doesn't even play the songs you have in the playlist, overall I'm going to be using YouTube music as this quite honestly sucks, I don't reccomend downloading"
"Full of unacceptable bugs and limitations. Support is non existent, and their product management is deaf ears to users requirements. I've just cancelled my premium subscription and moved back to Apple Music. After 2 years of struggling to be heard re limitations that only they have."
"I've been a premium user for a very long time. Not only are their employees actively trying to ruin and censor content that they don't like, but I am now receiving intrusive ads on podcasts that when I skip them it will restart my podcast. The ads wait until you put your device away to run the 5-10 minute adroll. Midrolls that didn't exist before are now ran every half hour. The Ui is absolute garbage. For music this app is alright, but is easily surpassed by Apple music. Total garbage. Avoid."
"App will not update so it will not open and support wants the build number which is not available in the apps current non functional state, I will not be sending all the other info that support wants, if you want my money you will fix this, that's the current out come. I will be deleting this hot garbage and canceling my sub."
"I'm irritated of the adds, three advertisements in a row of hearing 4 continuous songs. Best you can download the songs in mobile and play it in inbuilt mobile player."
I wish i could do less than 1 star you cant play a whole song of music without shuffing your songs. Next when i shuffle somtimes it goes to a song i dont even have. The other thing is this is the only app i can really use for music. What ever they did from what it was last year is horrible. DO NOT GET THIS APP!! Im sorry but they have ruined the app. Plus its useless if you get premium then get to play a song. Who would do such a thing? I would recommend to not get the app.
"I understand that ads are required on the free version in order to stay afloat. However, when I receive the message ""listen to this ad and enjoy 30 mins uninterrupted"", then I get ads every 3 songs and then I am asked to rate your app, don't expect a positive review."
"Constantly crashes, trash UI, and will always freeze when trying to boot up on wifi or on 5G. Takes a hard reset just for it work and a good 20 minutes for it to pull one song out of the app"
It's been very slow when it's loading a playlist or search music. My other apps work quickly as usual. I also tried to restart and clear cache but never made it any better.
"just add the feature of play similar songs as presently in gana app..... although i still love this app (Edit) I am starting to hate this app just because of that mosquito ad. I will definitely stop using this app if it doesn't get removed. And I am changing rating to 1, tho I would have -1 if possible.(edit) after every 2-3 songs there are 3-4 ads. Why are you guys giving that much songs, put 10 ads after every 1 songs. In that way everyone will start hating this app"
What tF did you do to the volume control??? Went to listen to music quietly this morning while finishing some stuff while kids were sleeping and every time a new song started the volume went full blast?!! No matter what I did in my settings on spotify and my phone. Had to close the app! Music does not need blasted everytime I listen to it! Volume controls should be up to me! Fix it!
"App has always been glitchy, for example, suddenly stopping playing mid playlist. I now can't even view expanded playlists to see what's included - surely this is a basic requirement for customers to know whether they want to listen to the album/playlist?? I've tried updating the app and restarting my device but still can't view playlist contents"
First it's got ads. second it's got terrible songs that has terrible singers. third you only have 6 skips unless you have premeum. Fourth i have to listen to those terrible songs if you run out of skips. Fifth there's no reapeat button unless you have premium. Id listen to youtube if i could. Id rate it 0.1 if i could.
"Latest Samsung / Spotify update has ruined it. Takes an age to open the app, when it does its glitchy as hell. I can also no longer skip tracks using my cars infotainment system"
I download a podcast and go to play later and doesn't work. I try listening to a podcast stream and it says its playing but nothing happens. I try playing a podcast and it says it cant be played in my location (In Canada). I tried listening to podcast on my Android TV and it sounds like someone is hitting the pause button every second making the audio choppy. I have deleted and downloaded the app 5 times and same issues every time. Samsung phone and TV. The app works fine on my apple phone.
"I'm Premium Subscriber, recently there were quite alot unknown playlists being added into my page, also auto liked many songs without my knowledge.. some1 hacked my account isn't it??? I have deleted those playslists but still they remained there can't get rid off. I have changed password also but the problem still there.."
The phone app is completely useless unless you have premium. Your phones inbuilt radio is more likely to give you what you want.
"Could have been better with lesser adds, they are way too much, other streaming apps might have a less responsive UI but atleast you can listen to music without any disruption, long time Spotify user but not anymore. Dissappointed to its peak, Spotify kills your motivation to listen to music. #BadChoiceslSpotify"
Since some recent update Spotify Connect volume control does not work: pressing physical volume button causes speakers volume change like if you were screen casting or playin bluetooth and not playing audio on your speakers through Connect. Issue posted on community forum and there is still no fix from support
"Absolute garbage of an app. Filled with ads, limited skips per hour, broken functionalities, garbage UI and pays the artists next to nothing. I'd rather listen to a gaggle of coughing elderlies, a power tools' orchestra or plain old silence than try using Spotify again."
"This used to be a great app, but the last update completely wiped out all music I had saved and now the app doesn't even work right. I'm cancelling my premium subscription and uninstalling this app, they ruined it."
"SPOTIFY DOESNT WORK FOR ME. It use to always work, now it doesnt work. What the hell happened? I try to play and it doesnt play music out of my phone no more. I pay for premium subscription and this does not work. I tried reinstalling app, clearing cache/data, nothing works. The play button doesnt work and it stays at 0 seconds."
App seems to have changed and is pretty counterintuitive now. I miss when I used to be able to actually select the device I was wanting to play on without a major headache. Thanks developers.
"Ok what the actual F is with removing the ability to just see liked songs by artists you follow? If I wanted reccomended artists, I'd want it on a different tab. HORRIBLE update. Seriously, you people need to start actually trying to improve user experience instead of making it worse EVERY update."
Never keeps up with time on podcasts so if I'm 57 minutes in and hit the button to go back 15 seconds it will go back to a 19 minute mark where I paused it earlier and go back 15 minutes from that spot..... also turned autoplay off yet when I start my car and load it up the podcast is just playing so then I have to play guessing game as to where I was at..... horrible app!
"Everything pauses after i lock my phone, just started doing this and its never done this. But its quickly getting annoying.. sometimes itll wait 5 minutes sometimes i might as well not even try"
"Ridiculous number of advertisements!!!!! Absolutely ridiculous!! I used to love Spotify, perfect number of ads and excellent music. Now, since a couple of few weeks, the number of advertisements has increased exponentially!! Totally ruins tbe experience Edit 1: THE AMOUNT OF ADS JUST KEEP INCREASING BY THE DAY. THATS A GOOD WAY TO BUG ME INTO UNINSTALLING THE STUPID APP!"
"Terrible would give -5 stars if possible! App was good 5 years ago... Now its trash even for premium users. New update earlier this year deleted half the songs in my playlists I spent years building. Now it constantly deletes songs, unsaves playlists, removes offline listening, and crashes at least once per hour. So pissed, might go back to Pandora until something better come along."
"Still waiting for Spotify to fix the app. No podcast episodes available, and app crashes every time I hit the ""..."" or follow button from within a podcast. Did I mention the ads? Why am I getting them now when pay for premium?"
"Worse music app bugs ever! Constantly pauses, music keeps playing with no control, change tracks with no visual que and says it's on a different track, podcasts restart from random positions, i pay for premium and still get advertisements, stops communicating with my Bluetooth buttons, stops communicating with my active 2 watch, no scroll bar on joe rogan podcast list, have to scroll endlessly, no gain audio functions, no ability to report the issues.... So many problems..... Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
Stupid app keeps crashing while playing music in the background... I don't get it never had this problem before and it's ruining the point of the app. We pay Spotify premium for a reason and this ain't it
This app is beginning to be quite garbage. I cannot listen to my music in peace and consistently without the app pausing by itself. This was not happening before at all. Please fix this issue soon otherwise pretty soon I'll just make the switch to Pandora. I'm very unhappy with this.
"Disgraceful, the app still isn't updated for the basic functions to work properly on Android 11. With more phones coming up for the update, I guess it's about time. App gets killed in background, music playback auto-stops upon first play action when connected to car BT, on BT receiver media buttons often don't work without app restart, many inconsistencies in the app UI itself. I guess they got the money, and simply keeping the service running, without optimizing it anymore is how they operate."
Update this stupid app so it will stop suggesting songs and ruining the playlists I customized with terrible music. I made multiple playlists and they're all ruined because of the stupid app suggesting stupid songs. Now they only play suggestions this is why so many people say this app is worthless. Fix it and people will leave positive reviews.
Initially it worked quite well but recently i feel there are some software error or something. I try to slow the sound but it doesn't work. The volume keeps going up without me controlling it. I thought it was due to my earphones so i changed at least 3 but m still facing the same problem.
"If you are going to make exclusive deals with podcasters you must improve the podcast features. New episode reminders, quick access to them once you open the app, etc. Just like many free apps available on the play store. I'm only using spotify because it's the only way to listen to JRE."
Will not link with modern equipment. Constantly forgets settings. Pissed me off enough after 2 weeks in to a 3 month free trial it will be cancelled and uninstalled. Garbage.
I like it except when I click the button that says I dont want to listen to an ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music it gives me multiple ads after I select no and it happens every time I turn something on
"Ngl, I love it, but now the update has ruined my vibe. I wanted to listen all my songs, but no there was to click to hear half of the damn audio like dude let me listen to my music, but no. I clicked on that little button to mix music and tried to skip the song it said ""you can only skip 6 times"" I clicked it and it won't let me skip. Which really pissed me off."
"It has everything to be a good app, but treats artists quite poorly and has terrible servers... And holy **** what's up with the bitrate of those ads, It sounds like they were recorded on a public phone!"
Got very poor experienced... Very bad sound quality.. no bass at all... Very bad surrounding audio quality.. Equilizer is not working for Red mi note 9 pro max... Saw promotion in BIG BOSS 4 nd downloaded it.. but as usual very bad experience with this...
"You want to play something? Think again! When it does not want to work, you can do whatever you want, but it won't work I would rate it negative stars, just for ruining your mood Plus the adds Plus the lag in screen update"
"I have had this app for less than 24 hours and am very disappointed. With my phone in my pocket, the podcast will pause for no reason. It is not triggered by notifications and I am not accidently pressing the pause button on my bluetooth btr5. The app has froze/crashed on me 4 times, in less than 24 hours. This is unacceptable from a popular app. I got this only for JRE, now I feel as the one thing I want from spotify is being held hostage in a buggy app. Might have to say goodbye to Joe Rogan."
I really don't get why people choose spotify over soundcloud. This app is just filled with nothing but ads. You can't even listen to your favorite artist most of the time. Sometimes it will just play some random artist like juice world on the next song. And premium isn't any better. Once again. I really don't get why people like this app.
"WHY CANT YOU JUST FIX THE APP. an update like every 2 days that don't even work. You kind of fix one thing, but then COMPLETELY ruin something else. The amount of broken features and glitches in this app is too much to list. This app used to be amazing. I can't believe I payed for premium."
Literally tells me my email has an account one minute and then the next it says it doesnt. I Literally cant log in this site is stupid. There is no place to get addaquite help and even after i reset the password it tells me im wrong. Extremely frustrating and useless.
"i don't like how you added the featuring songs or songs you may like because i just wan to play one song om repeat yet the other songs are getting in the way, i hope you could add a button if we want to add it or not. it's pretty annoying."
Terrible on android. No shuffle toggle button when listening to discover weekly. Also the radio based on any of my songs plays songs from the same playlist. Radio should show new music!! Also the 2020 wrapped crashes the app
"Been a Premium user for over 4 years. App just keeps getting worse and worse. UI is just plain awful now, addition of Stories is just plain stupid. Spotify does not listen to customer complaints, obviously, because no one wants this garbage. Finding a new streaming service asap."
"Its pretty terrible. You only get 6 skips and use it quickly because it adds suggested songs that are terrible. (Christmas on an edm list, really?) No way to see list of artists songs, only albums. Doesnt work right 90% of the time when started via Bluetooth. Gets stuck in 1 song screen and doesn't change. Can't select anything, can't favorite anything. Once they disable the forward and backward buttons, you better don't have an alarm set cause you can't shut it off while driving."
"When we press the not repeat button, after the album or playlist please don't play something else, I've been having this problem for a while now and if it doesn't stop, i might switch to apple music Thank you"
"This problem has been persisting now. When I tried to log into my account, Spotify logged me out for some reason without warning and when I tried to log back in, it said that my password is incorrect. When I tried to use 'log in without password' option, it brought me back to the log in page which makes this option redundant. It happened last year and it happened again and frankly, I'm getting sick of it and ruined my experience completely. Spotify, do something about this."
"First time user, using YouTube Premium as a benchmark (came over to continue listening to JRE). Wow, the Spotify app is buggy as hell! Dip into another app and back to Spotify and the pause button has died. Tried listening to a podcast on mediocre 4G, gave up. YouTube and Netflix have no problem optimising to this quality of network connection yet Spotify can't even handle audio without buffering. Can't uninstall because of the JRE exclusively but wish I could."
"Each update makes this app have more issues. The app now lags, skips songs, hiccups, has trouble connecting to Sonos and Bluetooth reliably, and has all sorts of other bugs that were not an issue until they did an unwanted face change. They took a great app and needlessly ruined it."
"Worst app ever. When you do shuffle play songs repeat even though other songs are left. When you specify custom order and in between if you got a call (app is not yet closed) , the whole order you made is changed. I spend so much time to maintain order and it ruined everything. And whenever you close app and open, the whole order is changed. The song you listened before will be the next song in new order. Itna bhi shuffle nai karna"
The new update ruined everything! I cant even access my liked songs without shuffle play and the stupid previews. Meaning i cant even listen to music in my car anymore without being distracted by the damn app
"So buggy on my phone (android) when I search for a song and play it, when it ends I can not play it again by touching the previous button. And lots of other bugs. I just got a subscription because there was this 3 months deal. Let me know if I can cancel and get my money back."
"I used to like spotify but when I crossed the song limit of 399 songs,all the songs started shuffling on it's own and I turned off the shuffle button also.All the songs are playing in a mixed manner not in my own arranged sequence.I also updated the app but it's now working...Please solve this problem"
no longer even plays certain things. looking for a new app is pointless though due to capitalism. just fix pls. 😑 ~~~Nov 2020 update: still very glitchy. but at least the lockscreen buttons respond since the last update.~~~~~~~~ full of glitches since 07/02 update. tons of crashes and stops playing when screen locked.
Ads? Really? Just YouTube Music even without premium is just that superior to this apps premium version. I am disappointed in this app for that like even what is 30 minıtes free for an add? Like heck you can't even listen the orinal audio. I was not able to find my all favoute songs like rage your dream and more. You can not even watch the video of the songs you listen. I honestly think even sound quality is bad with those other songs I used to listen. UI sucks. İt's really hard to use this app.
"It started out well, but quickly deteriorated. The ap is horribly glitchy. When trying to play my previously liked songs they disappear, only play a snippet or my favorite starts playing Christmas music. 🤨"
Multiple times when I am listening to music at work I have to force the app to close and reopen it because it freezes. This has been happening for a few weeks now and it is quite annoying.
"Songs keep changing for no reason and gets connected to spotify on computer when there is none around me. Even after I off my bluetooth, uninstall and reinstall the app, restart my phone, it is still the same. Have been using premium for quite a while but it only happened tdy. Is there a way to fix this? Thank you."
Horrible app if you don't pay! you have to listen to two advertisements after every song or 5min! You cannot choose any song neither skip them...In my opinion is quite useless
Incredibly greedy of spotify. Id be fine with just the ads and no library organisation but 6 skips per day? Way too far. They make spotify premium mandatory instead of a luxury. Using spotify at this point is just an absolute pain and ill be switching to a more user friendly music player. Not just all that but it crashes often when listened in the background.
"I have been logged out of my Spotify account, and its not taking me in, and also says ""something went wrong"" when I log in with OTP. PLEASE FIX IT. I had a pretty good experience but now this bug is ruining it."
Required ads without a skip button Says 30 minutes ad free and gives you FIVE ADS yet still plays more ads after only four songs. I just downloaded this five minutes ago despite critical ads advising against it. Uninstalled
"I wish I could uninstall this from the app store. Words cannot express my burning hatred for whoever designed Spotify, but what can I say that hasn't already been said a thousand times? The locking out of certain songs for non premium users, the inability to pick the songs you want to listen to, and being forced to listen to a playlist that will add songs you didn't want to add? *Seriously?!?* Stop bathing in your blood money and learn how to listen to your users."
"Too buggy. Everytime my audio is stopped because of a phonecall or me opening a video the current podcast that was playing then becomes unresponsive. I can't play/pause it, can't rewind it. The interface hangs up and if I play a new song/podcast the current playing bar at the bottom doesn't update, so I can't change move forward back for that song either. I can fix it but that requires me to restarty phone. Has been happening for a while now and it's a bit annoying"
Gui is horrible. Open a popular artist and try to find a song you like. Unless you know the album good luck. No real radio stations. only playlists that repeat.
"Everytime I play a playlist and go to a different app it quits playing the playlist, it even does that while I'm on the app. Please fix this problem, it would be greatly appreciated."
"Too many ads, it's so annoying. A single ad in a couple of minutes is fine but it's got way many more ads that interrupts my songs and ruins my mood. Please I request you to reduce the amount of ads you present amidst the songs"
"Full of flaws, for starters you cannot close the current playing song at all. If you have a playlist on the song changes but the names stay the same. A back button or a X to close the current song to make it NOT PLAYING any thing is basic. YES I tried closing the app and updating doesn't go away"
"The app got terrible over couple years. Apps UI is constantly out of sync with whats actually playing. Playlist fail to sync accross devices. Switching playback from 1 device to another is barely usable. Tv, 2 androids, and a mac in my case. I like the service in general, I still have my premium subscription, but apps somehow keep getting worse.."
"Will not play the song I select. the shuffle button is the only thing that works and it just plays random songs that I don't want. It didn't work on my Galaxy Note 5, it's not working on my Note 20. Can't enjoy, do not recommend."
1. Not able to link the mobile number + email + gmail auth into single account -Very bad account handling 2. Not able to use 6 month's free voucher. I got this voucher from flipkart for my purchase. But due to the one month of free usage in past the system not allows to use this voucher - No use of any voucher. 3. Why the system always require the credit or debit card to activate free account 4. Ads are 90seconds. even you change the song frequently the ads will come without considering 30 mins
"Reduce ads and add more song, I sometimes can't find most obvious songs and all I end up finding is covers. If you can add covers then you know that song, why not just add the original one. I don't want to listen to my favourite song's cover on my permanent music app. I like the app but I love my songs, I don't want to switch but can't help. Update (21 nov 2020): Ads have been increased to the point that I'm getting 2-3 ads consecutively. I know you have to earn but don't spoil user experience."
"Don't install this app , it is the worst app for music . It said watch a video to get 30 minutes of interrupted music but doesn't give any , just frauds . There are 4 ads after each music you listen ( almost every time) . They just show ads and irritate I will never download this app again and I advise you all to rate it 1 and don't download. I hope there was a 0 stars button too."
It's only good if you have premium without premium it sucks you can only skip six songs so if your trying to listen to a certain song that's only in a playlist it has to be within six skip's it completely ruined the app for so I got tired of waiting for more skip's and deleted it
"The app was amazing. But this update just ruined it for me. It is starting to feel more like JOOX now. The skips are trash. It is starting to feel like every music app is turning into trash. I liked it the way it was, but now, not anymore..."
"The WORST music app I've had to date. I've done all the things I'm supposed to to get an app to work on a phone. Takes about 5 seconds to respond to the pause button, will not auto que similar music. So if I search a song I want, too bad there's nothing after that unless I spend time making a Playlist. Would recommend YouTube music over this! Costs less to have Netflix every month."
New update has ruined this for me. I'll change the score when this is fixed. Constantly crashing. Beyond frustrating. Same issues still present after reinstalling. Now also on the radio function playing artists I've specifically told the app to ignore. Have been on premium for years but very close to cancelling all together.
"The app has loads of bugs, which is not acceptable because I pay for it monthly for the premium app. App crashes randomly, song stops playing suddenly, repats songs out of nowhere and more minor bugs that make it quite unusable. It's extremely frustrating and there shouldn't be so many problems with an app with such big community."
"Too often too slow, while I am actually paying for this service. Not uncommon: 10 seconds waiting for shazam to recognize a song, several minutes for spotify to be able to play it. Adding to liked songs takes up to 30 secs to respond (on recent Samsung S series). The waiting wheel or popup ""Go online to see menu"" are a daily nuisance (at same when netflix has no issues)."
"Chromecast support is really flakey and it really ruins the app for me as I rely on it a lot. Other apps don't have the same problem on my network. Often when I try and cast via the app, the cast icon animates for ages before returning to a non casting state. If I ask my Google Home device to ""play Spotify"" it often tells me to try again later."
"It keeps dropping seconds or a few minutes into every song during playback. Judging from my search, this has been a reoccurring issue for quite some time and either isn't a priority or they can't find the issue years later."
Paying for Spotify premium but can't use Spotify and track my workout at the same time. Offline downloaded playlists don't play at all. Have music playing and open Samsung Health = music stops and won't start again. Start a workout and start playing music = Samsung health quits and i lose track of the workout. Pathetic customer treatment and service - I don't won't to make an INTERNATIONAL PHONECALL to fix my premium devices. I would rate this 0/5 if I could.
This app is very disguisting....firstly it have many ads which can change your mood....secondly after every few days when I open it .....it comes up as ' unfortunately spotify has stopped....why.....I not at all like this app and recommend everyone not to download it
Ok ever since the last update the shuffle button on many of my albums won't work. All I get is the green circle over and over. Once in a while one album will work but it will just play the same song over and over. I really loved this app but now I'm thinking of just moving to a new music app.
Always pauses my music randomly and will not stop no matter what I do. Tried uninstalling/reinstalling and a quick google search revealed this is a problem for lots of people. Apparently this app is riddled with minor bugs and glitches that have been here a long time. Fix your app. Tired of paying for garbage.
"Glitches multiple times a day where it gets stuck on a song and an album. If I go to the next song it will play a the next song yet the name, album cover and time code will remain frozen. Requires a phone restart each time and this happens way to often. Intensely annoying!!"
"What just happened 😐 spotify used to be good! Now when I click on a song a button just pops up! I press it, then a really long ad, after the ad it just plays a random song! The spotify company, If your reading this, please put spotify the way it was before! 😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟"
"If you don't open the app for several days, when you open it on flight mode, you cannot play your downloaded songs. Not because they are unavailable, Spotify requires internet connection to play them even though they are on your device. This behaviour deserves 1-star and this is it."
Playing a song or album on Spotify does not look like is playing the play button is not pressen the and and I can't change track not pulling down notification bar shows Spotify please fix this is a beginner mistake. Terrible . Android 11 OnePlus 8 pro
Counterintuitive ui. Not able to view ratings on songs in album lists. Why would you have a shuffle all button at the top of an album? Queue and now playing conflict with each other.
"As a premium user, my experience with this app has been beyond terrible. Spotify is great, but this app is severely broken. You'd think they make enough money to provide a decent mobile user experience."
"Too many ads!! I understand that as a premium music streaming service offering a free version, I am to expect a certain amount of ads to contribute to their revenue stream. With the newest updates, this has led to ads playing upto a complete 2 minute ad (short ads, one ad offering 30 minutes of ad free listening and then one more ad). While the collection of music and audio quality that Spotify offers is superb, one small problem ruins the entire experience."
"For the love of everything that is good why would you purposely make is so that downloaded albums and playlists aren't liked automatically?? This being the case, there is no way to amass a large collection and shuffle the whole thing. Massive design failure from a service I've been paying into for years."
"I liked it at first, I made my own personal playlist with all of my favourite songs. I thought it was just an amazing free app where you can hear music but no. You have to PAY just to listen to music. Its horrible and I cant even go back to my playlist and cant even see all of the songs I have saved. I lost all of them. I was so proud of the playlist and all of the wonderful songs. Thanks for ruining it."
"Yo, great app, but I now keep on getting kicked out of the app, pleaaaaaaase fix this! Edit 1: I genuinely don't understand how checking how to reset my password is going to change anything. The issue wasn't even about that. It's just how the second I open it I get kicked out. Edit 2: Had to uninstall then reinstall to get it to work again. And it keeps happening, don't want it to obviously. Please fix this so I can use this app!"
"App is slow overall but non-functional without internet connection. I'm not sure why premium even gives the option to download songs if the UI melts down without perfect connection to the Internet. Instead of wasting development time on unnecessary changes, why don't you just get the core functions, like playing songs, to work?"
Worst app! not because the music is not nice but it contains so many ads that a person cannot quietly listen to whatever he/she wants to play and it forces so much on taking premium even if someone doesn't want to take 🤬🤬🤬
"Spotify is a great service and I find the Windows app fine: shame that the Android app is such an awful mess. I know I'm not the app's target market but it could easily be adapted to suit classical music lovers as well. Its operation is just not intuitive. Please play tracks IN ORDER and continuously unless specified otherwise. Please put the track number at the left, not at the end of the description. And why does Google say the app is incompatible with my new top-of-the range Samsung phone?"
"I don't know what's wrong with my Spotify. it doesn't shuffle music when i turn on shuffle, i doesn't auto-suggest when an album is finished or a song is finished and I turned on the function. these are the two problems i'm i'm facing and they're making it quite un-enjoyable i just uninstalled it then installed it again and that didn't solve the problem. Spotify please fix this problem."
Either you free or premium plan; only allowed play only 1 device a time. Don't like it the ideal of limiting to listening to 1 device at a time. Even the permuim optional does the same. A negative 10 on the scale of 1-10.
"Just like EA , it's free to use app , but you need to pay just to skip songs/ use the back button / and add new music / and play the music you want / save music / it's worthless for people who can't pay in internet , sadly it's not worth a one star after the new update , smh ."
Spotify has a greedy dev team that designed the algorithm in such a way where you're never really listening to anything you want to hear on your playlists! So frustrating not worth it
"The app was great until a recent update where the ui constantly freezes, the app randomly crashes, and the shuffle function plays the same songs in the same order."
"Formatted so weird, when you click on a song it just plays a preview of it. And the play back button doesn't even work. So annoying you need to fix it."
You're really making people sit through at least 6 different ads when they only get to listen to 1 song. I finally decided to get back on the app so I could support small artists and now you're gonna annoy me into quitting the app again. If there was a better app that had the artists that im trying to support then I would immediately drop this app all together.
This app is just about advertisements . The ads keep popping up one after another. Also these ads are very long . It just ruins all the mood. It would be better if you reduce the number of advertisements and show only one ad at a time . Really pissed off by all the ads
"After the new update using the app is terrible. If you save an album it doesn't appear in your liked songs list. And also there is no category for your saved songs. Why did you ruin something that was working just fine? After this ""update"" I'm considering to stop my premium and delete the app. Great now it doesn't work with chrome cast, PERFECT !"
I was really happy with the app but I can't connect to my chromecast anymore so I've checked it online and I see that many people have same problem since the new update. This is something that should be a priority to fix but it's taking already quite long in my opinion. I don't personally pay for a lot of apps as a person and I don't think it worths it if you don't provide what you promise. I'll change my review if this is fixed anytime soon. If not I will stop my membership too. Thank you.
"The advertisement of the woman saying, ""you could've listened to the radio... "" is quite offensive. And Spotify says that there will only be adverts every 30 minutes but it isn't. It's a lot more frequent."
"Poorly made app lacking even the most basic features to make the app functional and enjoyable. For e.g. have to perform tech gymnastics to stop the app from launching when my phone connects to my car, or to sort podcast epis by upload date. The most basic things require Googling or troubleshooting. I'll stick with Pandora, thank you."
"Casting to chromecast no longer working Edit: a reinstall does not work, a quick search on your contact platform shows that this is a widespread issue, resulting from the latest update"
This app is absolute dog poop. Quit trying to think for me in absolutely every way. Repeat? Easy searching? Sensible play lists? All no. I've never had such a contrasting experience from an app I absolutely love on PC.
Its not even letting me add the songs I like! And it adds songs to my Playlist that I dont luke. So then it tells you to pay 9.99 a month. Amazon music is so much better. You make your own play lists....this app SUX!
It's been a month that I get the issue of have to clear app's cache otherwise it won't work. Now since three days ago it has stopped getting connected to the chromecast and now I uninstalled the app based on the guidelines on Spotify website but now the app won't get downloaded fro Google Play! Like honestly this is getting worse and worse as if we haven't paid for the service. How can you not fix such global issue that so many people are having in the past few days?!
Please stop the unnecessary feature updates. Everytime an update comes this app removes features that I like and which are very useful. Why am I not able to sort my playlist? Why did you remove it. Doesn't make any sense. Also giving ads every 5 mins isn't going to make me buy the premium. Please stop ruining it with the updates
"Everytime ..Spotify isnt working showing that there is no internet..while YouTube Facebook Twitter Instagram Gaana YouTube music everything is working well,, idont get the point of making such an app which can't make it work..and each and every songs are getting ruined by the unnecessary advertisements.."
"Change the location of 'hide this song', I don't know who thought it was a good idea to put this on the place instead of the add to playlist button, I am hiding songs constantly, and unwanted!"
"This app is trash. I downloaded it just for podcast and it has made my life quite difficult. Constantly crashes, changes to streaming a song or quits playing audio."
"I'm leaving this at one star in hopes that Spotify will read my response. so one day I randomly open the app up again to listen to my playlist and the formatting changed to where I can play whatever song I want whenever I want which is fine I like that but the problem is that when I go to add a new song to the playlist which is now laid out completely differently, whenever I click a song the little plus button right next to it just won't work and I can't add music on to the playlist anymore"
Atrocious updates at the moment. Been a customer of Spotify for well over 3 years and since the Android 11 update they've been sleeping. Music constantly freezing when phone locks. Continuing playing and then going mute and skipping forward. This is happening on multiple manufacturers of my friends on Android as well. Hundreds of people reporting and themselves acknowledged on the forums yet in 3 months still not have found a fix. Honestly what are you up to?
"If you're using premium like i am, the app is great, especially for continuing your listening on another device. But if you're on free, the audio ads are extremely annoying and long, almost after every song there's 2-3 ads, that's not good! Especially given the cheap pay out they give to artists."
"The User interface of this app is Excellent. Wide Variety of Music Available. App is very Easy to use and the best app to make a playlist. It also suggests music according to the type/taste you listen to. BUT THE ONLY ISSUE IS THE Ads. IT LITERALLY BEGS YOU TO PURCHASE THE PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION. THE ADS INTERRUPT AFTER 2-3 TRACKS. C'mmon Sportify. An International company begging to buy a Premium Subscription? Its Like a Free Entry to the Gym, but to use it's equipments you're asked to pay😂."
Firstly this new update sucks Secondly u can't repeat songs anymore which I'm furious about thirdly why add a preview button when u could just play the song and see if u like it??? What's the point in this update??????? AND LIMITED SKIPS NOW!!! THIS APP IS RUINED CHANGE IT BACK PLEASEEEEEEE
"Music part is okay, podcast player seems deliberately designed to bring you into the app when you are not in it and keep you there. Spotify exclusive podcasts still have adds just a less useful interface."
"I've just updated the app and now there is this terrible delay whenever I select a song to play, before it was quick and I can change from song to song in a instant, but now whenever I select a song it takes like 5 seconds each time, sometimes longer, please fix this."
"It's tragic, how application for such a difficult task like playing music can have poor UX. Offline mode is non functional. If you are apple guy which is fine when someone else telling him how he should do things, add two stars."
"I used to like it (which was like a week ago) but the new update kinda ruined the whole app, I cant listen to a playlist with like 3 songs without it showing the songs that were randomly added(with auto refresh off)"
"Why does Spotify's volume control take over my phones volume control? If I'm listening to music on my pc, the volume buttons on my phone will only control Spotify on my pc. I might be listening to music on pc, open another app on my phone, get a loud add and not be able to do anything about it. This is ridiculous. It doesn't even work well as volume control for pc. Pls just allow me to change the volume on the device where I'm trying to change it"
"I really hate the way they change my mood, more specifically the continuous ads! I can't stop removing my earphones as soon as ads are there! I'm listening pianos then this upbeat ads ruined my mood! I freaking hate this!"
"Terrible. With out a doubt the worst podcast app available. They spent $100 million for JRE, but $1.38 on app design. I am here for LPOTL only. It would be nice to have only one podcast app, but this one makes that impossible. No playlist, organization of podcasts, search within podcasts etc.. There are so many problems I dont know were to start. It's a music app, that's fine, just stay out of podcasts!"
I'm 100% certain the people who designed the app for Android all use iPhone. Poorly executed. Two thumbs down. Customer service ignores emails and the podcast videos never load and ALWAYS freeze. (I have excellent wifi and I have used multiple phones on different networks and nothing works. I'm not new to tech.) There are reasons why certain companies dominate. Take notes because a better company will take your clientele.
"This app sucks. Constantly fails. Doesn't respond to my ear buds, doesn't open up a Playlist when it starts playing, button presses fail, etc. Choose a different music app."
"One the S20, this keeps hanging and often the response times when pressing buttons is incredibly long. The number of freezes when I need to reboot the app has got exponentially worse over the past month."
"Android 9 / samsung S8. Since a couple of months it is basically punishing me for daring to use the search function. Every click on any album or artist result in a 2 to 5 minutes waiting staring at the screen. I tried all the tricks suggested to the MANY USERS COMPLAINING about this on the Support Forum. Restart device, Reinstall, delete Data and/or cache. But these constitute a nightmare of user experience since they have to be done everytime. Get your F****** act together already."
"Love the service, hate the app. I recently switched from iphone to android and I have to say, the spotify app for iphone is way better. None of these ""offline"" problems when you clearly have service. Also the swipe to queue feature on iphone is so nice and intuitive, instead you have that feature hidden behind a menu that only works when the app thinks you're online. Why doesn't spotify support the Android app like they do for the iphone app?"
I reinstalled because the settings button was gone nad mow I can't get nay music because my settings are reset and I can't use the sd card. PUT BACK THE SETTING BUTTON. I WNAT TO USE MY MUICEFORENIT EXPIRES!! GREEDY!!!
"The audio quality is terrible. They have shortened songs, there is no depth to the songs and they have ruined the original songs."
"I have just reactivated my Premium Family account due to unsuccessfull last payment. However, it did not automatically resume to my existing account and I don't knoe how to check my previously registeres home address. Instead, I am required to re-register my home address & re-invite my family. However, everytime I want to register my address, the app can't never found my address that I have typed in & the @spotifycares twitter account suggested me to create another different account."
"Terrible app . Out of nowhere it started to disconnect from Google Chromecast and driving me insane. It plays few seconds the it jumps to phone, try with other devices, iPad, PC, other android phones and it do the same . I'm cancel my subscription this month. This is quite amateur app and worst you pay and can't even get a simple contact for solving issues for something that you are paying. Terrible experience."
Good for clicking a song and that's it you wanna make a playlist here's like 50 other random songs you can't get rid off and I try clicking the buttons for the syncing and it doesn't even work
This app is ruined. I dont have a particularly old phone and every time i use spotify it ruins my phone. It has always been a slow app to use. It is frustrating and freezes my entire device.
"I've had Spotify for over 2 years and absolutely enjoyed it until now. The update kicked me out so I had to enter my email and password, but of course, I don't remember my password as I've never had to use it in over 2 years! So I tried the ""login without a password"" button, sends you a link via email so you can listen to Spotify. The email states that the link will last 4 hours till it expires. As soon as I hit that link button it tells me, ""The link is expired"".It does this every friggin time"
"latest release ruined this app, literally cannot listen on my Samsung S10+ as always crashing, previous albums got frozen and still shows its cover, cannot switch songs etc. Serously guys, how can you let this go to production? Or if you let, why don't you fix it for weeks? I just signed up to Tidal because of this..."
"Loved the app till last updated. Now it is crashing, stopping for no reason, playing when i got the pause button or still playing in the background when I shut it down. It also keeps disappearing form the notification bar while playing. Please fix it."
With the new update i am not able to rearrange songs within the playlist. The edit playlist option is missing plz fix Spotify.. I really enjoy Spotify but thanks to this missing edit button now I'm hating it. Plz fix this issue..
"for god's sake, if your ads are too heavy to load than your song buffers, dont play them! i have to quit the app almost every ad because it crashes with your ads"
Why those stupid ad stop when I muted the volume of my phone? And the other ad will appear again and I have to press the play button instead of listening on your recommended stupid premium ads about spotify. I really hate it it always happen again when the ad starts and I kept on repeating and repeat on the same process. That's why I rated it poorly I can take 30 second ad but the 1 min ad get rid of it man.
What the hell guys? Loyal premium user for years but the latest update has killed this. I can't cast music anymore without it constantly skipping between play/pause. I quit the app and it reopens. I literally have to uninstall the app for it to stop! You'll need to roll back your last release ASAP
Why do u play the wrong song??? I wanted misfortune teller from tf2 then u play evolve from nerd out!! Who even are they?? Then i accidentally skip the song and it has no go back button!!!! I made a playlist of the songs i like then u play a random song out of nowhere!! Then i want to skip to brofist then i still cant find it for 6 skips now i have to wait!!! Screw u spotify
"out of all the apps on my phone this is 1 of the worst. It constantly crashes+slow 2 load w no notable stability improvments. It puts advertisement revunue over user experience. It has gone completely downhill, and the 30 minuetes of ""ad free"" interruptions are filled w ads anyways. Somehow with every update/iteration it gets worse. Spotify and improvement are antonyms. Nothing good has nor will ever come from a spotify update.Its only decent to listen to podcasts."
"This app is great but one thing ruins it all for me, it keeps adding tons of random songs to my playlist and it's so annoying. I delete them and resume my playlist but random songs keep PLAYING ITS SO ANNOYING"
It's one thing your designers choose to make the most counterintuitive ui choices but its just pathetic you can even get the app to play music without stopping or crashing constantly.
I do not believe that having a free version should mean having an unusable version. Stick on as like everyone else don't ruin functionality. You can only shuffle play others playlists and can't skip more than 6 songs per hour or skip backwards at all if you missed a song you like. If I could give 0 stars I would
"I gave the app a five star review previously, not so much any more. Glitches and bugged to the core. Normal features like rewinding and forwarding doesn't work, screwing up while casting to my Google speaker, pausing and playing in an endless loop. Well done to the developers, your recent update makes me want to quit Spotify."
"I'm going to TIDAL... been using this since 2016, had a great experience up until maybe 2 or 3 weeks ago. Officially canceling my subscription, exporting my playlists & saying goodbye. Constant UI freezes, sync issues between devices & the sound quality is subpar at best."
This app was working fine but about two days ago i had to delete the app for storage reasons and when i installed the app i could not log in and i still can't! please fix! It just kerps saying i'am offline when i'am connected to the internet and when i try to log in using facebook my system ui stops.
Hi spotify team.. I just downloaded spotify and I feel really bad telling u this that the app just keeps loading if we don't take premium.. Please make sure that everyone can use this app even if we don't take premium. Please get the app updated as quick as possible
"Pause/play button does not work on phone (note 20 Ultra). The only thing that works on the galaxy 3 watch is the next button. Used to like this app, now its just a pain trying to use it. Then you manually have to kill it it get it to stop playing. Why can't this be fixed because they done care to fix this. ?"
Last update has it freezing and stuck on songs. Displays 1 song but plays another song. Reinstalled...signed out....nothing. Also songs just randomly stop and have to press the play button to resume. Its not an internet or service issue because Apple music plays just fine without interruption
"Same issue everyone else seems to be havingz which been happening for quite some time now. On the Mobile App doesn't show you whats playing, continually stops playing, sometimes completely crasjes and doesn't allow you to even open Spotify. Doesn't allow your to move through a Podcast & Music via the time line. Sometimes doesn't open before Computer - Never allows me to open and ""Spotify isn't responding"" restart and uninstall and same issue still persists. Same with the Mobile App. Sort it out."
"This app has now decided to log me out, and won't log me back in, claiming I don't have any accounts associated with the email address. Just paid for a month subscription and now I can't access it. Only way to get help is to complain on here as the help option on the website requires you to log in!!"
"As a paid subscription service, to have an app that freezes on the player whilst playing songs, the thing it is designed to do, in solo or party mode, simply unacceptable. Please fix this. Spotify has been having issues like this for a while, but the last update has amplified this tenfold."
"Since last week the UI just freezes on a single song, when you change songs they play on the background but the UI shows the previous song. I find extremely hard to believe this passed QA, and I still wonder with all of the bad reviews around, how come last week's update wasn't reverted immediately"
It was good but the latest update is sooooo glitchy it starts playing randomly it's not showing the song I'm currently listening to (it'll get stuck saying one song but it'll be playing another) the notification bar isn't pooping up anymore. Overall I love Spotify but something is not working right at the moment. Edit to add now when I shut my screen off with the side button it starts playing music. Sooooo glitchy now it will just stop playing about 2 minutes after I shut my screen off
"I love the music service and the app in general but I have to report, as others have, the constant freezing, the fact that the screen often shows the wrong song, that the progress/time bar stops working. Maybe it's inherited some of Android 11s horrendous bugs but this has really ruined my experience this past week or so."
"While the app is quite good, my rating is for their strategy to push people to get Premiums subscription. It's not that they are advertising actual ads of products like how YouTube has. These ads only say get premium so that there are no disruptions. You are basically annoying us so that we buy premium memberships. I am sorry to say but such bullying will not work."
"Latest update breaks a lot. Songs play, but then they randomly stop, or the play controls disappears from the notification area. The played song is not in sync with the UI in the app. Frustrating UX e.g. cannot clear a large queue -- must clear each song individually."
"Plan: Premium Device: LGQ60 OS: Android 9 Issues: 1. App shows wrong song playing Progress bar doesn't move or the time elapsed/remaining. 2. When you leave the app UI and change to another app, after a while the audio stops playing and it resumes when opening it again, but still not showing the correct info. 3. No widget on the notification bar, but audio still playing. 4. Audio still playing even when closing the app from the square button on Android. It has to be force closed"
Latest Android version is awful. Serious glitches where a previous song you load is shown over one that is playing. Website solves require me to test my own phone in ways that are irrelevant to my Galaxy Note 10+. Just let me report the bug.
"The app is painfully slow and crashes all the time (sometimes to the point where I have to restart my phone). I have a 1 year old high-spec Samsung phone and every other app I have runs smoothly and quickly, but Spotify is a nightmare. It's at the point where I'm seriously considering switching to another streaming service just to avoid this terrible app. I wish Spotify would sort it out, a few years ago the app was fine but over the last 2 years it's getting worse and worse."
"When you choose an album it doesn't display the list of the songs so you can scroll through and choose, it displays the names and a 'play' button that plays some random songs."
"A lot of people reporting same issue as me, I keep having to uninstall and reinstall the app, I can't control the song, the controls freeze on one song and can't pause or stop the music. Basically the control buttons aren't working correctly, been happening for about a week now."
"A great service ruined by a steaming dumpster fire of an app. Extremely slow to load anything; even downloaded content. Almost impossible to search because it takes 5-10 minutes for a result to come up. glitchy, pauses randomly, says it's ""offline""even when I'm connected to Wi-Fi and able to use any other app. lots of frustrating things with the app which ruin the experience"
"Ever since a dew days ago my spotify has been skipping songs after 1-2 seconds. And sometimes I'll get to listen for atleast o seconds before the song pauses (without touching the pause button). I've tried clearing caches, reinstalling, signing out and signing back in and nothing has worked"
It wont even let me listen to my liked songs anymore I play my liked song and it plays random songs I know my liked songs are fulled to where it doesnt have any reccommended so why does it do this Spotify yoy used to be better and now I get infinite ads I will get ten ads in a row how is this normal and it says 30minuites ad free and I timed it it works for like 3 two minuite songs
"The UI is so buggy. The app keeps on crashing, the correct song isn't displayed sometimes and currently my dashboard is stuck on a single song even if I play other songs. Please fix the basic bugs."
It's good for what it does but my music doesn't keep my downloads. (Edit) now its doing almosy every other day I'm getting sick of this if I didnt have premium I would uniinstall (Edit again) ive tried all the things it said to do on the website and theyre deleted quickly after that so im just not going to download the song but im still gonna rate 1 star
Spotify - get your sh** together. Really instable and clunky layout. How an app of this size and range can be so instable and unintuitive is beyond me.
"I can only listen to 10 mins of music before the app stops playing and song progress bar no longer works. Album art and song names aren't even changing anymore. Someone messed something up in there pretty bad, have to force quit the app every so often just to keep using a subscription service I'm paying for..."
"You just can't leave well enough alone, can you? I was finally forced to update to the latest version to fix the long-standing endless loading loop, and it actually seemed bearable...until the Recently Played section disappeared, replaced with a bunch of 'personalised' categories I couldn't care less about; now I need to manually go find whoever I last listened to in the Artist/Playlist tabs. One step forward, a dozen steps back, as seems to be the Spotify design philosophy at this point."
"1) Sometimes bugs after moving out of car while listening via Bluetooth. Music don't stop, there is no notification on top, while music in app seems to be paused. Once only phone reboot helped to resolve the issue. 2) Bad ui regarding playlist editing. 3) No ""play all"" button without shuffle. Playing with shuffle and then trying to play tracks in order from clicked one sometimes results in shuffle play again instead. 4) (multiple general service issues there's no place for). Back to gpm (ytm)."
App completely stopped working recently. UI doesn't update with what song is playing and the controls don't work. App also has issues playing even downloaded music
"Suddenlly the songs which were in ny playlist stopped playing i tried again,switched my netwotk,i had logged in with my facebook account,i log out it,unintalled and installed it but no songs are playing neither there is any error coming for not playing the songs fix it quickly the songs which i am having are very precious"
"During 2 years, I'm using premium subscription and never had any problems. Just turn it on in background and forget. But now it's becames very wierd, when I turn my phone display off, after 1 minute music breaks playing. Also view of playing music is glitchy. Sometimes it doesn't show track which plays now, but the track which was played before, also with freezed interface (playback button, time, cover). But in the same time music continues playing. If it will goes like that, i will unsubscribe"
"I love Spotify but something is seriously wrong with the app. For the past week it would just show me a grey screen and not play 80% of the songs in my library, then suddenly start playing. Now as I am writing the review it is playing a song but it is completely frozen. I cannot control it either using my earphones or the buttons of play/pause/rewind and it's showing a song I listened to 5 hours ago. As a premium user of 4 years, I'd expect much better service of Spotify."
"Been using the service since the private beta and the app quality and stability lowers every month: more frequent crashes, slow, offline/slow network handling became clunky, today the app updated and player is not able to show what's playing anymore. I can't even avoid updates as the app stops working at the point and forces update. The desktop app is way more usable, the best is the web ui which basically does what we ask for: play music."
"Ok this app has been benefitted me a lot. This contains music that suits my entire mood. But the problem is, I've been experiencing malfunctions with its display (whenever I play different music, the previous music I played is what on its display) and it deletes downloads automatically. When i logged out my account to fix the problem i've been experiencing, I can't suddenly login my account as it always say ""wrong password"" even if I've been entering a correct password."
"Confusing and annoying experience: stations vs radio, disappearing queue button when playing podcasts, difficult to play your own mp3s, no song history :-( Also, occasionally the UI is out of sync with what's actually being played. It's astonishing how Spotify fails at its most basic core function :-("
"Tried listening to a playlist that I made but after a few seconds into the first song, it just goes on to the next song without me pressing the next button. This happens to the succeeding songs as well. Closed the app and tried it again, same thing happened. Also tried reinstalling the app but same error occurred."
Don't know what is up with the new update but the app is terrible. The loop play/repeat one song button is a joke. You never know what the app will settle on for you. Linking devices is hard and the volume bar has a lag and jumps back and forth if the command didn't go thru right.
"I just want to ask, What is this? The UI is unusable. I just want to listen to one song on loop and I can't even do that. Fix your terrible app. The one good thing about this app is that it's spotify. It has every song ever. That would be a good thing but it's still unusable. AND STOP ADDING SONGS TO MY PLAYLISTS."
This app is awful. I moved from Google play music and spotify is a buggy mess on Android. It keeps showing the same song playing even when I'm listening to other songs and pausing is not working. Really bad user experience and unacceptable for a paid subscription service.
"Switched over from Google Play Music recently, and I miss it. I do a lot of casting and device switching, and GPM just worked. Spotify is way too glitchy. When I pause a track, it restarts again a second later on it's own. I have to force stop the app. I have qualms with the UX too. I haven't found a way to go back and view played songs on a playlist to favourite the track. I'll check out YT music and see how that compares."
"Unusable, avoid! This app has become absolutely useless. Correct track information does not show and the player UI is messed up. Does not show the accurate song playing and album or song info stays stuck on the last playing song although the next song is playing. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and still having this problem. I am a premium member and this is poor. I'll encourage anyone to go and use any of the competitor services as this is very dissapointing."
"The content is amazing (thanks to creators) but I've continuously had a terrible user experience. Screens randomly refuse to load for no reason, the app will decide I'm offline when I am clearly not, the search function just breaks sometimes until the app/phone is force restarted and Bluetooth functionality seems to be based on the apps whims and the fix is always a full restart, re-pair and luck. If any other app had the amount of content I would switch in a heartbeat. Not worth paying for."
"Songs keep pausing repeatedly, a song title freezes in the menu so you can't see what's playing, the play/pause button freezes, sort it out"
"I've only used this randomly to play music and it's worked decently although annoyingly. Now that I've been forced to use it to listen to Joe Rogan's podcast here it's garbage. I have not been able to listen to a single podcast. It just won't play. It shows its playing although the counter does not move the volume graphics shows something is happening but nothing, no voice, no sound, nothing. Flip over to some random music playlist and it magically comes to life! I knew this would happen Joe..."
Advertisement is more than other music apps.. and this is very disturbing.. if someone can't afford your Rs. 700 plan for year... So they have to tolerate the 45 sec advertisement.. and 2 times.. like seriously.. Very disturbing app.. many of music apps also shows advertisement.. just for 15-30sec not more than this... And they have quite less amount of plans.. rather than this
"I do know what the development team was thinking to take away the ability to turn off shuffle. But it needs to be put back in ASAP, and i dont mean for next update i mean legit asap like within a week. Also why does music keep playing after the app is turned off? Ever heard of the phrase if it aint broke dont fix it? Wish i could rate it a 0 star but alas it must have a minimum of 1. If it's not fixed relatively quickly i will be canceling my premium and deleting every version if this app."
"By far the worst app ever, even worst than SoundCloud,I don't understand they would you put a ""shuffle"" button, why not just a ""play""or""start""?Why do we have to shuffle it?,Also,why would you bastards put in songs that I didn't even add on to the playlist?That's just retarded,and also,certain songs aren't on here and every time I try to search up for a song,you guys put up stuff that aren't even relevant to the song I'm looking for.over all its a stupid app and no one should ever use it"
"Sooo many ads! Absolutely ruins your mood with them! After every song 2-3 ads come! It's like without premium, you don't deserve a good experience listening to music"
Playing from Spotify offline music library in car does not work when using the latest Spotify Version and latest Android Auto versions to date. It used to work fine on earler versions. Plenty of reports from other Spotify users on forums if you web search. Am using payed Spotify account. Reinstalled both Spotify and Android Auto. Updating Android OS version made no difference. Please could you fix this as playing music in the car consume lots of mobile data or poor user experience.
"Started out pretty well but the experience deteriorated quickly, as I would often get five minutes worth of ads immediately after the ""enjoy the next 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" message played. Further, this service pays the artist very little compared to the amount of money made from a stream. It seems very hypocritical for a multibillionare to say to singers and artists ""bands can't just release one album every few years and think that'll be enough"""
Spotify why can't I switch between my phone and computer. Idk why you made this change but it is actually trash. I've been buying premium for years and this latest update just ruins my experience. If I leave for work and have one app on at home. I can't switch to my phone to play for the rest of the day. Worst update yet.
"Bad UX. I was expecting to know how to play music easily. I've been trying to play song for about 30 mins and still dont know how to do it. It just shuffle music. Even after I added to my playlist, once opened my plylisy there's no play button. And there's no repeat button either or I can't find it bcs it's not placed in easy to spot place. Anyway, good UX should make user know how to do simple and basic things with the app the first time they interract, but cant do it here.Decided to uninstall."
"The app regularly stops at random times for no reason and requires restart/refresh in order to resume, which does not correct the problem. Nor does updating the app, reinstalling the app, turning background permissions on or off."
"I love this app. But every time I look for an artist or a song ""something"" happens. It crushes or it says I have to check my internet connection, when it's ok. Plus, you deleted all the music I ""liked"", lists I created, or artists I follow. I want my info back. I pay a lot of money for the premium account. Fix it or I'll change to the basic account, or pay YouTube music instead. I can't tap the ""like"" button either. You used to be cool spotify. I've lost a lot of music I gave a like. FIX IT!!!!!"
"The ads are OUT OF HAND. I get you need to make money, but with millions if daily listeners you dint need an ad every 5 minutes! Also, millions buy premium so it's not like youre short on cash. Sort this out. You ruined your app. I want to listen to my playlist for more than 5 minutes without having to listen to 3 consecutive 30 seconds ads. 25% of my listening time is ads."
"I am using Spotify about 1 year, but now days too much ads are there. 3 minutes of ads are displayed every 10 minutes. Quite a bad experience now. It appears that someone is harassing me because of not subscribe to the premium. 😪😪"
"Been using this app for ages, only for it to start malfunctioning now. The glitches that keep occurring completely ruin the listening experience for me, highly disappointing. Plus the number of advertisements are a major put-off. Not coming back unless the bugs are fixed."
"1 star for hiding equalizer far away in the settings. A tool we all use numerous times during the day, when switching between car audio to headphones etc which all have different performance and the need to quickly adjust sound spectre and tone. Developers, get to work please!"
I think the computer version is good and the console version but mobile Spotify is the worst thing in human history like I seriously have to pay to skip a song really I can't even play the song back and it keeps putting songs I don't want in my Playlist and it just ruins the experience I would just recommend Sound cloud for mobile its so much better.
"Spotify seems to just want to coerce people into buying premium for a better experience by ruining their free version with repititive ads, I seem to hear more ads than actual songs."
"If my phone was the human body. This app is brain cancer. It never fails to crash my phone when I use it with another app. If I answer a text message, crash. Open Maps, crash. Lose a byte of data, crash or music pauses. My System UI crashes way too often. Figure. It. Out."
"Invasive advertisements. Don't bother unless you're paying for premium. Ads completely halt playback and require physically tapping ""dismiss"" and ""play"" to resume what you were listening to."
Terrible app. Can't stay private. Adds songs you don't want automatically. Did I say profile is public all of the time. Not intuitive. Just cancelled account and uninstalled app. Parents young kids should not have this.
Requirements for premium to listen to music i already own on the app on my mobile device is like being taxed by the government 2x for the same paycheck. No thank you don't need your craptastic music service.
"Navigation is all over the place, weird UX. There are some good features but way hidden. Modified my rating down from 2 to 1 as the app has lost my many years of liked song history :("
"I cant log back into my account. There is no ""forgot"" password option. And the link to sign in password free is always broken or invalid even within one minute. This has been happening for several days now. It used to he good but now this completely ruined it 😒"
"I've been using spotify for quite a long time. And with the current update, the application doesn't work on my phone (android: marshmallow). Like after a few hours after reinstalling it again, it stops working again."
Play All Songs from library was removed. Please return that feature. The Liked Songs doesnt include all the downloaded songs. You need to like all of each songs manually before they appear on that Liked Songs playlist. Very disappointing feature... That alone is not very user friendly as such a hassle to keep liking each and every song instead of just clicking on the download button... PLEASE RETURN THE ALL SONGS OPTION/PLAYLIST!!!!!
I love it.... But... Recently... It has stopped opening... I tried uninstalling and re-installing it... It opens the first few times but then it stops... Everytime I try to open the app it just comes back to home screen now.... Get this fixed quickly please...
Ur ads r absolutely thee worst ive ever seen in my entire life its a joke. Every single time an ad starts 2 play vid (cant disable) the app locks up freezes & i have 2 manually click pause/play cupl times 2 get each of the 3-4 ads u require us 2 watch 2 actually play thru. Otherwise im listening to nothing until this. This is mainly in win10 OS spotify app but im using it thru my android device alot remotely so it most certainly applies here. Also haven't been able 2 listen offline after buying
"AWFUL app honestly if you're starting out building your music library and do PC/ANDROID stay away from spotify!! it's not just that it's awful....but rather it use to be okay and somehow they TOOK AWAY FEATURES. we had a widget....they took it away. we had different ways to see songs....they took it away. Ongoing issue for 2 years now, really pathetic from this company. Once I have a few free weeks in my life and and done training will def try to move my music elsewhere"
"Honestly, I am extremely dissatisfied that Spotify provides UI changing updates with a copy & paste update descriptions. Bad practice and I will most likely be switching."
Music is great but app is slow and often stalls. Sometimes it says it is playing and no audio heard but if you restart song it is ok. The music experience is ruined by a poor mobile app . Also have similar problems with the desktop app. These things should not be experience d from a service I pay for
"Hi, I pay for premium and I'd really appreciate if certain bugs were fixed considering I pay every month. First of all, when clicking the three dots for the song menu (to add it to the queue e.g.) it will lag and then come up with 'go online to see menu' Why should I have to be online to see a menu? My songs today had to be downloaded again for some reason but then the download stopped halfway through and wouldn't start again. I'd also love the quick swipe (add to queue) feature added to android"
"I am paying for this app. With all of the glitching and not continuing to display the song that is playing, the features I am paying for should be FREE!!! Only reason I have this app is because it has an independent app for my watch. Soon as another music player goes watch compatible, I'm cancelling. Horrible experience..."
"If you are a free user who only wants to listen to some popular music, you cant, because you don't get to choose which song you want to listen to, which wouldn't be so bad if only you could skip the song you don't like and move on, but you can't even do that without paying. That is the equivalent of Whatsapp not giving you the option to choose who you want to text or call. This is not something a music streaming app should lack. I'm disappointed even though the desktop version works just fine."
"This app is so terrible. It will randomly stop working in the middle of a song/podcast for absolutely no reason at all and then when you open the app again, it never picks up where it was before it quit. In a 20 minute time frame the app quit 6 times. FIX WHATEVER GLITCH IS CAUSING THIS."
The user experience on the app is pretty poor. Load times have gotten very long and the app constantly fails to play a song when you open it up. And to round things off the Spotify app wothin Alexia has stopped working so I can no longer play through my Echo (which is one of the main advantages to having a premium account).
"Needs a lot of work on the widgets, 'Tune in' has a widget when u press it at any time it resumes ur podcast right where u left even if u restart the phone, video quality is very very low, it consume a lot of battery. It can only cast the audio with no video!! If u pause and leave it for a bit the play button while the screen is locked disappear"
"The music and quality are excellent but the thing here is you only offer the Family Premium, which is not suitable for my budget. Please dont close the prepaid offers for 7 days! So disappointing! 😑😑😑😑😑"
This app used to be the best on the market then about a month ago a update has completely ruined the app super slow always laggy keeps force closing can't even listen to a song for 10 minutes it's ridiculous moving on to YouTube music thank you for everything Spotify
waste of time and also you won't get music as per our requirement. In this app the search engine is big draw back. when I searched and selected one of the famous music director best songs. it was showing and playing all the disasters songs of that music director.
No Original Soundtracks The app is wonderful but tracks are misguiding. Original soundtracks are missing of several albums. Even fake tracks have names of original singers.
Terrible app. Downloaded the podcasts I wanted to listen to and they will not play without an internet connection. What is the point of downloading? Searching the internet it appears there used to be an 'offline' button but that seems to be gone. The only way I could get it to play was to put my phone in airplane mode. Then the app seemed to realize it couldn't go anywhere so it actually played the downloaded cast. Why is the default internet instead of just playing the downloaded file?
"This was once a good app, now its literal trash it constantly adds songs to you playlist, has these stupid features that just ruins the whole thing unless you pay for premium."
"I listened to 1 song got 3 video ads in a row, listened to 1 or 2 more and it says hey here's a short ad for 30 minutes without ads (5 or so seconds to decline) so I watch the ad its pretty quick and ends off saying enjoy your uninterrupted listening, cool right... 2 or 3 songs later (no not Beethoven songs, songs that were at most 4 minutes long) got another ad so I immediately closed the app and typed this review (something I don't ever do) :( TLDR/ I get less ads on YouTube w/o bs lies. :("
"5/20/20- When did the price go from $9.99 to $10.69?!! I was never sent a message about a price increase, they just took $10.69 out of my account. I'm cancelling my subscription! With all the glitches in the app, it was barely even worth the 9.99! I'm going back to Amazon Music! 9/9/2020 - So glad I quit paying for Premium!! App has turned to complete s#!+!!"
Irritating. There seems to be a new update where the horizontal player is now a tiny part on the side. I can't set it to shuffle without using the vertical player. All of these manipulations are a pain while driving. I wouldn't have written a review normally but these design desisions have been put in place since the latest update.so clearly someone in the UI team is an alien who apparently hates driving.
They clearly want your money. I can't even choose what song I want to play FIRST from my playlist and it even said I have to wait ONE HOUR FOR 6 SKIPS. How ridiculous 🙄! I loved how Spotify was before and now you've ruined it for yourselves! Good luck trying to get me back to this app.
"I have stable internet to browse instagram and youtube. But when i opens spotify it shows like there is ""no internet connection"". I mean i have a network speed like 1mbps then why the hell it's showing like there is no internet. Even if it's showing there is no connection, the playlists can be played with the green button, the outcome is that its playing like a radio. I can't select and play one particular song in a playlist. What the hell?"
"For months since the increase in playlist size update, this has been a freezing, laggy, unresponsive, sound-randomly-stopping trash experience of an app with subpar UX that they are too incompetent, slow, or stubborn to fix."
"Is stuck, saying it has no wifi while at the same time every other function and or app requiring wifi in order to work, goes on working with no problems except for, Spotify's chumpy and cheezy app!😡🤬"
How can the biggest name in streaming get it so wrong? Constantly gets itself in a twist showing the same song and a stalled playback timer even though music keeps playing. Skipping songs moves the music on but not the interface. I thought it was my phone or Bluetooth device but it happens consistently. Force closing the app doesn't fix it and sometimes music keeps playing after doing so or after pulling out aux or disconnecting from the car. I am going to start asking for money back...
"Keep us updated on what changes your making, don't be vague. Your algorithm and hide feature are bad. You keep recommending artists that I muted. The search button is not working"
App search quit working after two days. Tried reinstalling it and every other recommendation I could find. I paid for the service then Spotify offers no way to contact them for help. I just wasted $14 for a month of service I can't use because I can't search for my favorite songs or artists.
"Quite bad after the last update, now all my songs can only be played in shuffle. Worst of all, I can't even skip that much. I really wish that the update didn't exist...(this app had gone to the need money side)"
The bar at the bottom that shows what song is now playing and the one that appears on the notifications bar of my phone regularly gets stuck on a song so I don't know what I'm listening to later on in the day as it freezes on a track quite often. I have updated the app and it's still doing it. Very annoying as I do pay for this service so it should function properly. what will be done about this as I'm unhappy with the service?
"Love the music Podcasts and all content.Having said that. The app suxs . It takes forever to load downloaded music. Forget about podcasts. Half the time they won't open. Just sits there as a green circle spins and spins like windows 98 on AOL dial up. Then there's the problem of my music mysteriously being un-downloaded. it will just be gone my whole library, then will take hrs to re download. I write this at 330 am after trying to put on Conan O'Brien's awesome podcast for the last half hour!"
Love all the music i have availbe as a premimuim member however having issues. First 3x now i have downloaded all my playlist music for offline play and it keeps getting wiped off my app🤔 Thats 8gb of music that i have to use my data to download 3x for a total of 24gb which caused me to hit my data limit. Now i go to use app today and i cant log in app sent me the reset link to email 2x within 5mins. It says it is valid for 4 hrs each time when i click new link to get back it says expired.
I downloaded this to listen to the JRE podcast. Too bad this terrible app doesnt actually work. The episode is downloaded but still required data to play... I tried deleting and re-downloading and it still will not work without data. This needs to be fixed but they dont care about users so it wont be.
"Spotify is awful. Unfortunately they're a pretty poor service, they don't stick to their offers. Contacting the help services is also impossible unless you use Twitter. I'm quite sure they are breaking customer returns rules. I cancelled within 10 mins and have still been charged. They didn't abide by their offer and have essentially stolen £10 from me. I generally use YT music and have been much happier with the user experience."
"I've got regular problems with data failing to sync between devices. And for as big as Spotify is, the app seems really juvenile. There are many limitations that make it very frustrating and annoying to use and manage a music library with. There are so many things they could do better with song/playlist metadata to offer better customization and user experience. The Spotify engineering team must be careless, lazy, or have their hands tied by an inept UX or design team."
From 5 stars to 1 star. I had to get rid of Spotify because the pod casts would not play. I did all the necessary trouble shooting. Guess what it's not my equipment. It's Spotify
Terrible app. I have used it on many devices and the android version is so buggy and slow. They need to rebuild this app and make it as reliable as the Apple version
"It's very disappointing how glitchy even the paid version is. Constant freezes and holding my phone hostage during. Something connected to system ui is a major bug and an update to fix would be appreciated. If I can't use the app without frustrating errors, I won't be keeping my subscription."
"Just stop with the UI churn and forcing content I don't care about front and center with no way to hide it. The UX has always been a mess but at least I can get used to it over time... until the next time it gets changed around just to promote some garbage Spotify wants me to like, disregarding what I (a paying customer) actually care about."
I really hate it when the adds come in.After every five songs or so there are two adds consequently.it completely ruins the experience.like ur listening to the song with eyes closed trying to fall asleep and suddenly the stupid add comes in.We don't want that..plz
"Impossible to listen to a real album. Instead I get a random playlist containing everything but what I wanted at first. I can't even skip tracks I don't want to listen, perfect when I find rap in an industrial ""album"". The only way I found to retrieve the album I wanted is to search for the individual tracks and gather them in a playlist, but the incessant ads ruin everything. I'm not putting a cent in an app that doesn't let us choose what we want to listen, the desktop version is way better."
"I'm not sure how, but this app becomes worse and worse with every update. Moving buttons between menus, constant lagging and even crashing, changing the logic of saving music to the library, removing features like an option of removing songs from a saved album... And now it just decided to remove half of my downloads of the saved albums for absolutely no good reason! On top of that all, the app heavily drains the battery of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones."
"The UI is the worst... It only lets me shuffle music on a playlist and it doesn't even play the music that's on the playlist. It plays music I never even asked for... Terrible app, never using again."
"Bloated and slow. Sometimes just doesn't play when you hit the play button. Focus on core functionality, then fancy gimmicks once you get the bugs knocked out..."
Unsure why but since update beg August the app is very buggy. The name of the song / cover art will not change even when it switches to the next song. And the music sometimes stops for no reason. I will change my review if the bugs are corrected but now quite upset to be paying monthly for such a buggy service.
"The Cornetto advert is too annoying, played at a stupid volume and plays repeatedly every 20 minutes or so. Yes, I get adverts are needed - but the same one every time? And such an irritating, loud one? It just wound me up during my long workout. It puts me off using Spotify because it ruined my music experience"
"Jeez the ads one after another, that you have to see once again in 30 mins if you've watched it but closed the app after that. And where's that replay or loop button .. switching back to my previous app"
"Using Spotify on the computer is great. On mobile not so much. It acts like an off brand version of Pandora on Mobile. It'll also be like ""Listen to this ad for 30 minutes of free listening"" You can hit a button saying ""No Thanks"" and 80% of the time it'll just play 3 Ad's anyway. Waste of time."
"I'm using spotify free, I have one issue, that is the preview button. It seems that when I check albums the 'see more' option to see the songs inside the album is gone, I hope you can fix this because it really isn't helpful removing that option."
"Terribly buggy for weeks now. Nothing loads from page to page. Touching on things the app is unresponsive. Downloads used to take seconds, now they hang. Really just a bag of garbage now. The UX has always been terrible. Now function is terrible. Choose another music provider."
"Given the latest couple of update the app has become less and less stable. Issues includes but are not limited to: - Songs stop playing after 5-10 sec - The ""progress bar"" gets stuck but everything else works fine, the progress bar stays this way untill reset or directly staring a song - Artwork iterates through the artwork form another playlist There is more but i am hitting the char limit Device: Note 10+ Os: one ui 2.1 Spotify v: latest as of 21082020 Have premium and have tried reinstall"
"I really liked this app so i decided to go premium, but since ive started premium autoplay has stopped working. Ive tried everything from uninstalling the app to rebooting the phone and checking if the shuffle and repeat buttons are turned off but nothing seems to be working. Is there a solution to this coz i desperately need it"
"I used to really enjoy the app, have been paying for premium for quite a while.... but if I have to keep uninstalling and reistalling just to get this app to work properly I will be cancelling and finding another music app. Constantly seem to get a 'Spotify Connection' notification that won't go away, app won't update what song is playing or display as being active on lock screen/drop down. A reinstall will fix the issue for maybe a few hours to a couple of days. Samsung Note 10+. Over it."
"No longer works as advertised in BMW on Android. Only plays over BT, no steering wheel button functionality. Very disappointing and has me looking for a different music service that will work."
"I liked this app when I first started using it, but in the past few months the adds have become really invasive and are ruining the experience for me. It used to be that when adds played you would listen/watch 1 or 2 and then get back to your music. Now it's almost always at least 3 adds, and they're getting longer too. Then, the option they give you to watch a specific add and get 30 minutes add free is now a lie. The last few times I have done so I started getting multiple adds play in 5 mins"
"The app keeps crashing on pressing option button for sharing on any song P.S I have paid subscription also still facing this issue. Edit: i haven't seen any reply , so bringing down the rating to 1."
What are you doing to this app? Why on earth do i need to be a premium user to connect my device to my xbox now. I didn't have to be yesterday so why now? I barely use Spotify so I don't see the point in becoming a premium member. Stop ruining the app. Getting stupid at this point.
12 quid a month for an app that doesn't work half of the time! I think you guys earn enough to make sure we can at least listen to a full song without having to close the app and open it again! Get you app fixed
"It was great until it quit working. It will not load my playlists, any search results, and anything else. I paid for this and it doesnt work anymore"
"Music won't play. Start one of my playlists in shuffle mode and it will randomly stop playing. Not paused, the play button still is set on play. Try skipping to next song and nothing. Cannot listen to music I guess. If this lasts more than a couple days than I am canceling the subscription."
Had to stop using Spotify as it started requiering log in. Previously I could use it just with a voucher code... Now it wants log in. 1 Star as I spent money for a voucher and spent a lot of money on buying Data for downloads which is useless now. Not interested in data harvesting apps. Good bye
The only reason why I gave it a one star rating is they have the edited version of Deep Purple In Rock without the guitar and keyboard solos intro to Speed King. That pisses me off. Not to mention thry are missing some albums from classic rock artists.
"Has issues with Bluetooth connection, skips, pauses on Android, Xbox, PC. Don't bother paying for something that's not good enough to work as designed"
"This app has become unbearably laggy, I always have to exit the app and start it all over again, and most of the time the refresh button doesn't show up when there is a network issue."
"The UI has been glitchy recently. Casting to other devices glitches out, the currently playing track doesn't update with the forward/back command, and sometimes it doesn't update the Android system that the app is playing music, preventing me from controlling it from the home screen."
"Last Update: I reached 'contact us' and they also couldn't solve the problem. I ended my premium consequently. Up2: Forced to close. Nothing happened. I will use 'contact us'. Up1: There is still no canvas. I just uploaded the app. Fix the bug please. -I've been using this app for 5 years. It was a great app before but It's been breaking down a lot. I have no canvas option anymore and my sis has it on phone. We both PAY, why I don't have it? It's such a shame. I will consider quitting this app."
Worst player ever. No working widget. No easy readonable way to pause a playing track/playlist. It is so bad that i think that the great music selection is hardly worth it. Howvcome such a massive company use the worst app designers and make such basic errors in user intetface and design - is beyond me. I teach computer science students - and spotify spp became our chief example of a failed design...
I loved Spotify when I first downloaded it but a few days ago it stopped showing my full playlist. I can't play the songs I want to or skip any songs. The previous and next buttons have been greyed out. Please fix this because I would hate to have to switch to another app.
"I've used it since the beginning. Never have I ever faced issue while viewing an artist. For example, I was searching Juice Wrld and the app kept on getting crashed. Truly disappointed"
UI for artists and albums continues to be rubbish basically forcing you to use playlist for everything and now the app refuses to show me any playable songs for any artist in my list or any albums. Desktop has the expected artists and albums. It's getting harder to justify premium when the apps usability has been getting worse with practically every update for the last couple of years and the resfusal to take note of any feedback telling them otherwise.
"Dont waste the 10 dollars and dont waste your time. If you dont pay, you cant ""PICK the song you want, For the (FREE) membership, it only lets you shuffle, and theres no difference between (premium audio) and (free audio) qaulity. This is counter intuitive and a very greedy move on you guys. Wow. I can literally pull whatever video I want off of youtube, convert it into an mp3 file and listen as much as i want, offline. I cant fit enough hatred in the 500 character limit for this review"
New UI is horrible. Dont understand why they made the changes they did. Cant make any sense of how to find my downloaded music and my artist section is full of artist I dont know or want to see in my list. I have been premium user for years and for the first time considering stopping my subscription. Cant understand who thought this ui was a good idea.
"For some reason I can't log in in my account, I usually log in by using Facebook but it doesn't work this time, it says to try with my email, i've tried but still it won't work. It's been almost a week, I've uninstalled and installed the app 2 times already, but the problem still there, i've tried using WiFi to log in but it won't let me. I like this app but honestly i'll have to quit the app if the problem continues"
"No no no no no. You change the immediate buttons back to how they were right fu*king now! It's all messed up now. Not convenient, nor is the repeat button even working. Stop messing with a good thing. I'm drunk, and now I'm pissed. Not okay Spotify."
"Slowest app ever used.It just ruins the mood ,the song and the page takes forever to load,not worth spending the price for this platform,instead of paying million dollars to podcast hosts,hire some better developers,and please work on the server side,you can contact me for the same."
Intentionally designed to be frustrating adding songs I don't want into my playlist every time I close the app and then denying me the ability to skip them by only offering a limited number per day (these songs are hidden so you forget they've been added). I was going to pay for this app but will stick to supporting artists properly on bandcamp etc. Terrible predatory business model.
"Awful customer support. Don't have lyrics despite the feature being launched in my market over a month ago. Any inquiries are met with vague, useless replies. Extremely frustrating as a premium customer."
"I regret downloading this, it's just completely worthless, whenever I play a song it switches to the other song like when I try to hear Kamado Tanjiro no Uta it switches to other stupid music that I don't know, add a button that you can undo the music then I will give atleast 5 stars, if not, I'll just rate to 0, 😡"
"New ""features""? Cannot use shuffle anymore. Upgraded from a Galaxy s7 to a galaxy s9 plus and now The shuffle play button no longer works for me/is visible where it usually is. I cannot shuffle play the artist page or any dong radio's anymore. Why?"
"- Update Aug 6 2020. Removed shuffle button on artist page for no reason. Now you are unable to simply press a single button to shuffle an artist catalogue. Instead of adding features, Spotify continues to delete them."
Got rid of the option to sort my music by artist. I don't understand why this design was made but it would be such an easy fix and yet Spotify refuses to do it.
"My download button suddenly stopped showing up even though Im paying for premium, have enough space, only use it on one device, restarted, etc. Upset :( basically it's treating me like I don't have premium which I do and like I pay for it so I would like to use premium please."
"Whenever I wanna play a specific song it plays a different one. Theres no loop button anywhere. And even if I put a song in a playlist when I play it, it still puts on a different song. Please do something about this."
"I'm ok with ads, it just didn't work properly, clicking a song or the play button on the playlist started playing random songs that I don't even know. Tried clicking on a song from the playlist and it just wouldn't play, very confusing and frustrating experience."
"Great until this week, I pay for Spotify and generally enjoy it immensely. But after the recent update it has become so buggy. Constantly freezing, stops playing, now playing song doesn't change at all. Incredibly frustrating. Have uninstalled losing all my donwloads which is annoying. Hopefully it gets fixed relatively quickly."
"its great. it lets me stream a bunch of songs anytime. my issue with this app is that it has a handful of ads, which just annoys me. my other issue is that whenever i want to play a song, it just plays another song besides the song i wanted to play- and it ruins my vibes. i gave it 1 star so the developers would notice, fix this please :> i will change my review to a better one"
"Purchased muisic, saved to phone under new file uninstalled apotift nkw muisic gone after cancelling.premium. shouldnt matter i paid fkr the music not your plattform wheres my purchases. this is why i try to get physical copies because downloads are gone after you delete the server even after saved to sd card. THIEVES. TRIED RESPONDINGNTO SUPPORT NO HELP"
Update: 08/02/2020 Yet again Spotify gives less attention to the Android application versus the iOS application. There are very obvious issues that persist for weeks without getting patched. This most recent update causes music to randomly pause or play and media buttons don't work randomly.
"Breaks my headset media button, autoplays when connecting any type of bluetooth even when app is not running, takes control over media playing, stopping my audio book to start playing random music"
"First time I tried this app. There were no limits. I thought I was using the free plan but it turns out that it wasn't. After a week or so this app became nearly useless. It doesn't allow me to skip music in the playlist. Are you serious? What kind of cloud computing power is involved to make up such limitation on my own phone? So if I need a better UX, I need to pay for it? Well, deleting this app now."
"Allow us to organize our personal lists in subfolders, also please give us an option for me not to get lists with remastered songs, I like only original Versions, remastering always ruin the songs. thank you"
"Everything is great, but the download feature needs improvement like giving a pause button for large downloads and not directly deleting the downloads instead! Premium feature is useless until you fix the downloading problem"
Thanks Spotify for ruining my mood by stuffing with ads... Too much annoying .. very awful experience .. You can use this app to hear ads and stuff.. You get plenty of ads and less music in continuos playing.. Literally the only app which advertises itself almost every time to spend your money for premium subscription.. Not recommeding this app for die hard music lovers .. you can use any other app for streaming new songs..with very less ads and sometimes nothing🙌🏻
"The new interface is unintuitive and just doesnt flow. Please can I get back to the old UI? I used to be able to shuffle albums, and do so much. Now it feels like there is very little functionality in the app. I recently came back to Spotify but will not be continuing with it."
The worst app of music of all the times. I can't play the songs which I want and they're showing all artists of the world. But when I click to see. I don't find the button to play.
Three sets of advertisements during a twenty minute drive. The trial period requires banking information. Then opens the likelihood of continued billing after trying to close the account. I don't think so. One star is far to generous for what seems to be a...
"A great app ruined by ads, thats what i can say, some ads would have been fine as i know money is required to motivate further devlopement of an app and for better features but like literally 2-3 add all together at once, that just ruins the fun of music, and how ironic is it, most ads are not of other products but just spotify saying that ""ads are so annoying and your music shall not be hinderd by ads"" as it is not already doing it..... Please, decrease the amout of ads"
"Just switched from the iPhone version to the Android version. The iPhone version's playlist filter/search bar is always visible, and yet the Android version hides the filter bar behind multiple extra button presses. Retarded change, retarded UI design. What the hell were they thinking?"
"Your user experience is just the worst! 1. I can't play what I actually want to, I have to listen to your stupid recommendations which I don't even want, I have a playlist, and I want that, nothing else 2. When I want to play one specific song, it doesn't play, only another of your stupid recommendations This is basically pay or be tortured I would overly recommend the pc version of spotify, because this is hell!"
"Sorry for giving a 1 star review, I had to because I want to address the issue I am facing with the app. The day after I recharged my phone's data i.e the day after the deadline , the app was not connecting to the internet. When I reinstalled the app, it just shows that I am signed in to my gmail account but it later just shows a black black boring screen. Please help and fix it quickly.."
"hello! So I have been using spotify for quite some time already and yes it works perfectly fine. But today, after when I updated the app, all my songs in my library that has been downloaded offline is gone, so I tried redownloading it again and after it finished downloading I tried to go offline, turned off all the connections etc. but all my downloads are gone again! Idk why this is happening. I am using a premium account. I hope there is a solution to this because this is disturbing."
"Why did you move queue button from a convenient place to a inconvenient place, for no benefit? Like ye obviously I'm gonna share the song more often than I'd go look what's coming up next. My god. And when could we get the function of adding to queue by swiping laterally on a song? Like they have on iPhone?"
"This app has degenerated so quickly over the last few months. Even worse, today after my battery died I turned on my phone and my entire ""Liked Songs"" library was empty but for one song. All those years of songs, gone. I can't do this anymore. Everytime my phone died I'd have to redownload my entire library, I stuck through that. I can't stuck through this. Updated my rating to 1 star"
Why am I paying them?? Countless problems with the app. Few of them: 1. The sort button isn't working on podcasts channels. 2. App getting stuck all the time. 3. Can't change the fonts size. Would love to hear on alternative app for Android user.
"In general, I like it, but the following features are important to me. 0. NO OUTPUT DEVICE SELECTION in the desktop app settings. 1. Missing ""Add to queue"" option for playlists. 2. There is no way to buy individual tracks so that you can then listen to them without subscription and advertising (Google Play Music have this feature). 3. I did not find in the desktop client a quick launch button (with one click) of recommendations mixed with my favorite music (like ""Flow"" by Deezer and ""I'm feeling lucky"" by Google Music). There is a similar, but not one click. 4. There is no number of times played for each track (Google Play Music have this feature). 5. No lyrics in text form (like in the unofficial Google Play Music player, but it's in beta mode right now). Lyrics in text form is really useful for non native language speakers. For example, in my case I often don’t understand English by ear, especially in songs, but having the lyrics in front of my eyes I understand everything or almost everything. P.S.: I give 1 star for the attention of developers to the review, in fact, I would rate it higher. If the mentioned features appear, I will change the rating."
"No-one would accept functionality this poor from any app they paid for unless it was as ubiquitous as Spotify. Sure, music plays fine on the phone - but as soon as you want anything 'special', such as connecting to other devices (which is a selling point of Spotify and Spotify-branded devices) or making a queue (which WinAmp did better in 1999!!), Spotify struggles like the appalling POS that it is. Spotify is a prime example of why monopolies are bad for everyone - except for those who own it."
"Mediocre interface, and scan-to-join simply doesn't work. The UX is generally f-ing appalling -- I expect far better from an app like this. I also, perhaps foolishly, pay for the damned thing. Anyone with a chance to negotiate adequate streaming licences should be paying attention, because Spotify has only been treading water or getting worse for the past two or three years. Make something better, and you'll have an immediate audience."
"Im very unsatisfied with the fact that you cant swipe left in order to que songs on android. This is my only regret from switching to android, and it is quite frankly more of a bother, than I though it would ever be. Most annoying!"
"The new 'artists' tab is terrible. Major step back in terms of UI. It used to have all the artists whose songs you liked listed, but now seemingly arbitrarily ""recommends"" them to you unless you manually follow the artist yourself. So, if you remember the name of the artist but not the specific song you're looking for it makes it much harder to find. Frustrating."
Sorry for messing with your ideal statics. In web version there is forward and reverse buttons that do not work. Also installing version for PC outside l produce error and sends to windows store
I have been trying to update my subscription but its not working. And my money has been deducted. I have tried using a different card also it does not work. I have use spotfy for quite sometime now and i like it. But updating my premium is such a problem.
"The new update sucks, the queue button which was at the bottom right of the screen is now inconveniently hidden behind the menu and replaced by the share button. It also seems to me they removed the album length feature in offline mode, which is a really big minus for me."
"No dislike button on tracks is a major let down, as I keep getting suggestions for music I can't stand. Probably will move to another app after the trial."
"The new update came out and ruined the app. Since the update I can't add any new song to my playlist. I go to an artist, try to select any music and it won't let be."
"Not able to play to all my Sonos devices. It plays to one device but does not play to the other. This might be crappy Sonos design, but I'm using Sonos as output from within Spotify and I'm unable to select all my Sonos devices as output."
"never had a bad experience with premium until the last update. it keeps bugging and bugging some more! I cant have access to my whole playlist. the new design is cool and all, but I'd rather yall prioritize fixing bugs over the appearance of the app."
"Was working great, but now all of a sudden the ""and more"" button below albums and artists seems to be broken. Please fix this!!"
Yet again another one of your team's fabulous updates that messes everything up. Look maybe you guys need to test these updates with Alexa devices first because you can't seem to do and update without messing something up. Yet again you have ruined what was working. Can you guys get it right? Do you need someone to help test your software that actually uses it everyday? Because I do and I sure would like one update that doesn't screw me and my 11 speakers over Everytime.
"Appalling. The app crashes all the time, refuses to download songs, refuses to play songs I managed to download some time ago, refuses to connect to devices in my network, doesn't align properly with last.fm and changes settings at random. I will quit this app as soon as I found a good enough alternative."
"I can't login in once I log in the screen is pitch black and has no content. No it's frustrating. I don't know it's my device or ur UI of the app. I know it's not my device, earlier it used to show that your internet connection is bad or slow. But if I open other apps that requires Internet it's all good. So it your app that needs upgrade before I install it from all my device. Thank you"
"There are a lot of better quality streaming service but I went back and got Spotify Premium again because out of the available streaming apps in my country, your library is the most vast that I could overlook the mediocre sound quality. Pros and Cons. But the fact that I got premium and get ads about getting whatever plan is very intrusive and ruins the user experience that I'm considering switching back to the previous streaming app I use. I paid a premium subscription for a reason."
"Dated non-material design UI lacks basic functionality that is sorely lacking once you get started. Here's some missing must haves: • Full Google Home and Chromecast compatibility • Long press to immediately play a playlist from mobile apps • Allow manual ordering of playlists from Mobile app • Allow sorting playlist library alphabetically • Uploading songs you own which Spotify does/will not ever have • No way to send feedback within the app. Unfortunately, they are stalkers that sell out your usage to Facebook without your consent and despite not logging in with Facebook or giving any of your Facebook info to them. The lamest part is they don't give you any options to permanently opt-out of sharing your habits and usage without prior approval from you."
The reason for the rating is the software issue where my queue button disappears and turns into a share button. Clearing cache and uninstalling and reinstalling helps 1 out of 10 times. Please fix this
"Update hinders user experience. By making the queue button less accessible in favor of promoting a ""share"" button, Spotify once again demonstrates its preference for using (paying) customers as free advertising instead of providing an effective music platform."
Woah what the hell are you guys doing with the updates put my queue button back on the bottom right. Why has it been replaced with a share button. Can we uninstall updates bc y'all keep making the app worse. Might have to go back to tidal if this keeps up smh Spotify come on now all these updates ! Can we please get an option/button to add a playlist to your queue. Can we get this in the next update please? I've been waiting a really long time..
The new update keeps making things look wierd. I wish there was a away to change the presentation. I dont like the new update at all. Like its bad enough you can't pull the page down to quick search anymore. Now I have to worry about accidently removing most of my saved songs...... like I nearly did before this review.
"I started with a Love & Hate relationship with Spotify but a sheer lack of product improvement and innovation has made it more of a Hate & less of a Love for it. Apart from other things, Spotify misses out on two very basic but critical features really badly, 1. I pay for Spotify Premium so that I can download the songs for offline listening but unless and until I specifically put the App in OFFLINE mode, it still continues to gobble my mobile data and never cares to check whether the song to be played is already there in Downloads or not! The experience is even bad in areas with choppy network coverage and while travelling. 2. I have a playlist of 1500 songs but the SHUFFLE feature always ends up playing any 30-35 songs in a loop and thats about it! The SHUFFLE feature is completely broken! I have to kill the app, relaunch it, again press shuffle button and the story continues!"
"Why is the autoplay not working? It sucks to listen on just 1 song and then search for another. i have premium but i really cant enjoy it. I tried to re-install the app, toggle the autoplay button and even clear may cache and still none of it works. Can you help me?"
"Spotify now SPAMS YOU WITH ADS EVEN WITH PREMIUM. Yep, no joke, their latest update will randomly push a ""Spotify recommends"" ad FULL SCREEN so you have to click listen now or dismiss button. No option to turn it off in settings, everything for notifications is turned off but it will give you full page ads which they disguise as ""recommends"". Nice going Spotify, I'm going to take you f**kers to court."
"Decided to update this review. Your platform is still god awful. I was able to try your paid service by borrowing a friends account. Nothing about this is user friendly, especially your app on the playstation consoles. Anything that needs me to log in 2 dozen times before I actually get logged in is a terrible design. Seriously what does ""linking my network to my account"" even mean? Is a password and username not enough now? Delete your app and never try again xx"
Put the queue button back where it was. Replacing it with the share button and hiding it behind a menu has completely ruined the flow of listening to music on the app. Why the hell am I paying for premium for someone to make this app LESS usable after an update. Get it together.
"Put the queue button back, dont be spastics, yes i know that, and updated the app, but still the queue button is swapped with the share button , gobshites, THIS IS NOT AN IMPROVEMENT , DONT MAKE THE UI MORE COMPLICATED !!!"
"It's designed to get you listening to knew music and keep listening. For example, at least in the free version, you must to use playlists (can't just use one song). If you have less than fifteen tracks in your list then Spotify will add tracks you have not selected, and limit your ability to skip them. This means you end up listening to a lot of music you don't like, in addition to the audio adverts."
The software has massive BT connection issues. The UI is extremely difficult to use. It takes way too many clicks to find what you need. The app is generally buggy beyond that. The Spotify platform is a fantastic idea that is being horribly executed. I think they're just developing way too fast and not taking the time to build it right. I'll be switching soon. I'd rather have less features and more reliability.
"One of the recent updates replaced the go to queue button with a share button, which is already absurd in my opinion, but what really triggered this review is that, in order to see my queue I need to tap on the menu button on the upper right corner, but to get access to that menu I need to be online. Now that's just straight up hostile ux design. I've been a paying customer for quite a while, but things like this amd general unresponsiveness is making me consider alternatives."
"as a music app, one of the worst; in fact, unusable. as a YouTube for music, it's OK. I was thinking of Spotify as a replacement for a music app and actually I wasn't expecting interesting quirks and great features like the ones JetAudio or Musicolet has, but I was expecting at least the features of a regular music app, that comes with phones out of the box. But it's not the case. This app doesn't even have the option to play all songs by an artist directly! edit:ShufflePlayDoesn'tPlayALLSongs"
"I hate the shuffle feature on the music, it's on every play list and it's annoying af. And it adds songs to your play list that you've never heard before. And There is no button that let's me download the music it's just dumb"
"Premium users have been experiencing three bugs in the app. In the latest versions of the app, 8.5.62.904 and 8.5 .63.941 published on June 10 and on June 17 2020. It's regarding listening to downloaded albums offline. The app will just say ""Something went wrong, Have another go?"" and have a ""Try again"" button. Another offline-bug was in version 8.5.51.941 of April 2020. Three bugs in two month is just too much, way too much: ""We're not a bug, you're the bug!"" Spotify tech support for Android."
"This app used to be amazing. Now it won't auto play the next song and when I type in a specific song and press the forward button for the next song it just pauses on the current song. I'm going back to Pandora, why am I paying for Premium on a service that won't even work."
Edit to add: now they've remove the cast to devices from Google home. So um don't use if you want to cast? Removed queue button so now I'm paying premium but can't control what a playing. Reset all my settings and used up heaps of data before I realised.
"The android app is years behind iOS and it seems like spotify doesn't even care anymore. Still no swipe to queue feature, unpolished animations and plenty of hiccups in the chromecast integration. On top of that, the new location of the queue is just awful as no one ever will use the share button more than the one for the queue. Please(!) just fix that, I really can assure you that really no one shares music over spotify, we have YouTube for that. Moving the share button won't change that fact."
"You can decide if this app is good for you or not based on other reviews. I want to address only one thing - how feature updates are slow compared to iOS version which for example benefits from new design for few months now. Android users shouldn't be treated as second class citizens when it comes to updates. UPDATE JUNE 26 Today we got the update... After several months. UPDATE JULY 3 I just realized that it's not the full overhaul, just the play/shuffle button has new design..."
"Firstly, why is the swipe to queue, and swipe to add to playlist features not available on Android? Secondly, why has the view queue button been replaced with the share button? Thirdly, why does it take 2 different clicks to search for a song title in liked songs or playlists? Fourthly, why doesn't the search function not allow for searching genres? Or at least allowing the user to add tags to songs to search for? All these features missing, (some available on iOS) makes the experience annoying"
"Dear spotify, when I press my volume up and down button it changed only the spotify apps volume. It really uncomfortable when I want to change my phone volume while listening the music through my laptop. Please fix this."
I loved spotify before but this update ruined it. They make random songs be on your playlist taking up data and you cant listen to your music. To much ads. After each song i need a new ad. Im going to youtube bye spotify :/
It is easy and nice to use this app but its annoying to get ads after every song and this days two ads come in together which makes me mad.....its true that quality is better here but if you have a third party application to download music and have a feature that u can customise ur auio quality i will recommend u that instead of using this app......the premium ask for too much and not everybody in this world uses paid ones.....tota garbage
"What have you done to the queue button! It's such a pain to get to now, why is sharing the song where the queue option used to be? Annoying and doesn't seem very consumer friendly or useful"
"With premium your basically paying for unlimited music. It's great, you get almost all the songs in the world! But don't expect an actual working app or good developer feedback. Also expect tons of basic features to be missing from the app as developers are too lazy to add anything and spend more time on removing useful and praised features. Wouldn't doubt that the app will just be a green play button a year from now. Also their ""team"" is just a bunch of bots so don't expect real feedback lol."
"EDIT : after several ""quick"" reinstalls, still experiencing this problem. Other reviews show that it is also an ongoing issue. It's been over a month now with no clear fix. It gets extremely frustrating. // Have loved the app for years, but after the recent update Spotify constantly asks for permissions to play in the background, even though I have allowed all possible permissions. Music playback often stops in the middle of tracks, and when I reopen the app tracks have to be forced to restart."
"Worst music app I've ever had. It rarely works, and when it does, I have to listen to eight ads just for one stupid song. The app randomly stops working. And no, I will NOT buy premium. Why should I get premium when the base app barely works? This app is useless. I submitted quite a few reports; nothing. No response. This app is useless and so are the developers."
This was pretty cool until it started to freeze. I've been having this problem for about two months now even after the latest update! Someone said this app was better then play music. I felt that way when they gave me three months free service. But I've been paying for quite some time now and I'm goin back to music play. Never had this many problems there!
"For something that's been around for so long. I'm shocked you don't have the ability to continue streaming after all Windows are closed. Secondly, maybe I'm stupid but where is the option to import purchased songs? Not a very intuitive platform whatsoever, really disappointed that Google Play Music moved to YouTube otherwise I wouldn't have made this switch."
Adds songs you're not interested in to playlists. Literally makes you pay for the skip button. Promises 30 minutes of ad free listening if you watch one ad but then gives you another ad 5 minutes later. I don't know why people use this trash.
"After using this app for so long on iOS, I'm very disappointed with this Android version. I've always thought they had to keep the app as clunky and harder to use as it is right now to make it work in older devices but then I've tried other music streaming apps such as Deezer and Tidal, and their UI was much better. All in all an inferior app to the iOS version, harder to use, ancient UI, no HiFi sound quality. I've been a premium user since 2011 and as of this month I'm leaving this platform."
"They replaced the ""Queue"" button with a ""share"" button on the song menu. I have never ""shared"" a song but am always rearranging my song list on the queue. Bring the queue button back!!!!!"
"Terrible functionality, millions of glitches, clearly designed by people who know nothing about music. Spotify, apart from not paying artists fairly, offers comically limited functionality and crashes CONSTANTLY. The queue malfunctions and disappears at random, the drag function works only occasionally on web/app/desktop, and I have to clear the cache/reinstall the app every few days to achieve even rudimentary functionality. Disaster platform."
"This app sux. For a music streaming service who seems to be killing it in the stock markets I need to be having a better experience please. You can't reorder your playlists. Every other app allows you to, You Tube, Tidal, Google Play... All of them give you ability to reorder. And you can only shuffle/play!! I don't want to shuffle, they're all there in a particular order for my playlists for yoga. They're in order for a reason. Give me the ability to make my own choices please."
"Can't dislike songs when not connected to data or wifi, music sometimes doesn't play when connected to Bluetooth, and you can't see all new releases from artists you follow. Instead you get their very unintuitive ""Release Radar"" playlist that oftentimes puts the clean version of songs in it instead of the actual ones, misses new releases you wanted to know about, and is just generally difficult to use. Extremely annoying app for ""just a music player"" and I'm switching back to piracy ASAP."
I wish they would remove the share feature from the now playing screen and replace it with the queue button which was there before. Nobody uses the share option as much as they do managing their music order
The app has always been difficult to navigate and super buggy. The most recent update removed the song queue menu button and my music stops playing after five to ten minutes all the time. 🖕 That's said. I haven't had a music subscription I've liked better.
"The user experience is awful and apparently my payment info goes out of date each month, which is really annoying. Spotify is just begging to be taken over by another app."
Too many adds for spotify premium itself made me uninstall this application if you can tolerate a lot of adds then only download it thats all i have to say if you want your users to stay with you keep your adds short or provide skip button
the Spotify app for fossil generation 5 SmartWatches does not allow you to click the like button and is therefore not useful because the feature to play pause and adjust volume for music is already built in
"Stop making stupid UI changes. Don't need an inconvenient extra step to access the play queue, and I will never use the share button anyways. I use Spotify for listening to music not as a social media platform."
"I absolutely loved Spotify premium until the latest updates. Revert the changes to the queue button. Now it is inconvenient to access. Revert the changes to the scrolling option. Great app, but there have been several stupid and unnecessary updates."
"They make you pay $10 for excessive DRM checks that make it so you can't listen to music offline. They change the UI frequently to make it harder to navigate to playlists, artists, albums etc. Assuming you can even play them offline. Use apple music or tidal."
"Spotify is a useless app designed for music. 5 ads in a row! You giys are playing more ads than music . Improve yourself and stop begging for money to avoid ads. We already spent on internet and phone , now you are telling us to pay more to avoid ads. We didn't ask for ads. Stop this cheating."
"Use to love this, but recently it drops out during songs and only starts up if I push any button on my phone. Really annoying as I cannot listen to a full song without it stopping on it's own. It is extremely frustrating. Don't tell me to uninstall and reinstall or restart my phone. I have done all of that. The problem needs to be fixed. Not fair when you are paying for something you cannot fully use."
Apparently the app reset itself automatically every night and by morning all of my downloads are gone. It require login again and again without any reason and there too it takes ample amount of time. I am a premium user and still the app lacks convenience.
Was working perfectly fine with all my songs downloaded and saved in my library for playing offline. A library that I'd spent years building. Then go to play it today and library is empty and layout different. Fantastic update that Spotify. I get you want to update the layout and interface from time to time but why? If it ain't broke don't fix it. You've had a lot of money from me and countless others you could at least have an app that works.
"UPDATE: I think there's no live customer service, I got an automated email response. I followed what they emailed to me and it didn't help. Offline songs still not working properly. After one song, the playlist stop. You have to click on play button again to play the next song. Then repeat the whole process. Updating this app doesn't make sense if its not working properly. I've been more than 5yrs on paid acct and this happens?! Such a waste"
App is very badly designed. You can't delete song from the playlist while it's playing. You have to go to playlist... Use search... Find the song.. Then you can deleted. Ridiculous
"Terrible on Android. Will not show on home screen and lock screen like Apple Music does. Definitely not designed for any phone other than IPhones even though I'm paying for the service too! Music often cuts out for no reason, especially when connecting to Bluetooth."
Terrible Podcasts and songs keep on cutting out or it keeps on displaying that it is playing on a chrome browser which is bizarre. I'm paying a premium subscription so this is quite frankly unacceptable.
Requires log in everytime I open the app! I use the premium version but I have to download the songs everytime I go offline. Very much disappointed. Fix this!
Every damn time the play button stops working...I have to reinstall the entire app. And then it works fine until I close out of and try to go back in and play again...then it stops working again.
"It has quite a few of the songs I want to listen to, but that is one of the very few good things about this trashy app. When I wanted to listen to ONE SONG, it made me go through about a million suggestions that I couldn't. Freaking. Care. Less. About. I don't want to listen to your freaking ""fLy ME tO ThE MoOn"" or ""RaInbOw ConNeCtiOnS"" or something, I want to fricking listen to Everything Stays. There are ads every. Five. Freaking. Seconds. I am looking for an alternative music app."
I get the ads that say if you listen to it you get 30 minutes of uninterrupted music on us. Well that is a lie because within 5 minutes there is a ad that interrupts you. It is stupid because I can use mobile data and listen to suicideboy but as soon as I want to listen to some hardbass it glitch's out and closes the app by itself. Subscribe to modest pelican on YouTube because you peli-can.
"Why is it that when you play downloaded albums from the library, the app asks you to connect to the Internet? What is the point of having a library of downloads...? Internet is very unreliable where I am so I use downloads quite often."
"Hey Spotify and team, there's a bug with the recent update and that is the app crashes (closes automatically) whenever I tap the play button for any of podcasts, I don't know if this is happening with just me or few more devices, please fix that I use the for listening podcast as much as I listen songs on it. Sorry, for 1 🌟, its just for spotting up for you guys 😄."
The layout is terrible. The fact that there isn't a section just for your songs that isn't a playlist is terrible. The fact that liking a song by an artist doesn't put the artist in the artists tab is terrible. They took a once great UI and just threw everything that worked out. Spotify is nothing but terrible now. I will not be spending another cent on this app as it's not worth it.
"Music etc perfect, but the app has some glitches that really get on my nerves! Why why do I have to re-download all my music after each app redesign? Why, at the same time, are my storage preferences reset and music is downloaded into internal storage (instead to preferred SD card) causing my phone to get crazy because internal storage is getting full? Why do I have reset all app settings (including downloads) after update, because when in offline mode update makes it impossible to login?..."
"Our downloaded playlists are continually deleting themselves when our device isn't even connected to Wi-Fi. Sometimes it happens mid listening to a Song.its so frustrating!we updated our device thinking it was an issue with using an older tablet but even a brand new tablet using latest updates makes no difference. According to Google this is a problem lots of users have but there is no known solution- I would love to see this glitch fixed, cuz until then our user experience is so bad!"
"They have made it clear they don't want people to use their app, openly attacking and taking leagle action against people who do. I'm dirt poor and cant afford a lawsuit for listening to music, so i'm going to be using one of the many, many other apps that lets me listen to music and podcast for free, without trying to rake me over the coals for using it."
I left Pandora as I was very unhappy with their app. My friend suggested Spotify and I've been happy so far. However Spotify has been randomly quitting during playing. I pay for premium and I am not receiving that service.
"I tried many times to cancel my subscription with this app, then when i clicked the yes cancel button, it always say opps troubled occured. Its like as if spotify wont let you cut your sybscription so that they'll still get your money even if you're not using the app anymore. Tried many times and here i am again, installing and uninstalling the app trying to figure how can i unsubscribe it. Im starting to get pissed."
Utterly hopeless ui. Desktop version works fine. Android version is unusable for me. When I load something from my library it plays in preview mode every time. Can't find any way to play the thing properly. Also does not list the tracks on the album so I can't select them individually... Uninstalled.
"The app is extremely slow compared to YouTube Music. I am also confused as to how to efficiently choose songs and start a radio playlist. I select a song and it plays it twice, sometimes once and stops. I think the menu options and features can be a bit more intuitive. YouTube music has it right with UX, but I'm trying Spotify since I heard it has more songs. Disappointed so far. Might cancel after my trial."
"Spotify, on mobile, is very annoying to use. When choosing a song, it only plays a preview of it. Ruins the app experience."
There's something wrong. When i press the play button it won't play and it seems like it's unable to play then it will shuffle like crazy like someone is pressing the next button even I didn't press it. And yeah the music doesn't play when you tap the first music it wont play
"I'm moving to Amazon Music because Spotify isn't as good when comes audio quality. I've been with Spotify since I stopped using Napster. Spotify has the best UI and the best way to discover new music, so I'll check back in a year to see if Spotify has improved. (Actually Spotify is probably the best app but the audio quality in Amazon Music has stolen my heart). It's great to see Spotify doing podcast now, but I won't be using that either because the playback speed I like is 1.7x."
Spotify was great probably a 4 star until the last update after the update you cant add albums to your collection you cant listen to a album in order it shuffles it with other songs by the artist and similar artist. If you want to listen to just that one song good luck you better hope you get luck and click the play button and the playlist starts with that song. Ive seriously thought about deleting the app amd going to youtube music I hope a new update will fix this
"Can you not put the unfavourite liked song button next to the play/pause button? Or at least add a confirmation box after. So many accidental lost songs. Such a stupid design choice, especially for a premium user."
"To clarify first I love spotify premium, but spotify free on mobile is a slap in the face to everyone. You can't choose what you want to listen to, your playlists are ruined with extra tracks you never wanted, and on top of it all they dont even give you enough skips to get to your own music. Its a joke and clearly that way because of greed. Its completely fine on desktop too which is hilarious"
"This some the most terrible design of an app I have ever seen. If you want the app to be free, let people play the songs that are the soul reason that they downloaded the app in the first place. They have started with this stupid system that you have to pay for more than half the apps music. Don't use this app unless you want to slam your head against a wall until you bleed. This is what happens when someone has monopoly over an industry and no one can do anything about it. Just NO."
They have completely ruined the app with the update because when i try to play example bad guy it playes a diffrent song completely and it adds random songs to you're playlist please could you change it back to normal
New update ruined everything. You cant even pick which songs you want to listen too in your playlist and it wint let you skip to a certain place In your song. I hate the new update. I used to always get my friends to download spotify and i used to listen to my playlists on roadtrips but the new updates ruined everything. To much has changed. Please go back
"Great collection of songs. But UI is just terrible. In case of play queue, previously played songs just keep vanishing. So I want to listen again a song I have to keep pressing back button repeatedly. It gets even weird if I want to play songs from search menu. If I add 2 songs that i search manually and add to queue, skip to 2nd song, come back to 1st one again 2nd song will have disappeared from play queue! Truly uniquely stupid behaviour. Kudos for not getting such basic functionality right"
The worst UX I've ever experienced in an app. There are bugs that are years old and it doesn't seem like Spotify even cares. I wish I'd started out with YT Music instead.
"Became annoyed with this app quickly because this app is stupid and doesn't know if your device has Internet or not. I don't use this anymore because I have YouTube Music. If anything, YouTube Music is far smarter than this. Just waste of space on my phone. Besides, this app doesn't even have music videos OR some very popular songs. YouTube Music is way better. I probably wouldn't even rate this app one star if I could."
"don't bloat your app and make it so unbearably slow that it's just unusable. Maybe it's also a problem of Spotify needing files on my SD, but you can do that asynchronously. Probably if you rolled the app back to a year ago it would perform better, only have a slightly worse design."
Good app.. when IOS and Android will be the same version I will probably give a 5 star. Alot of functionality are missing when you compare IOS and Android. And its not a question of hardware its a question of programation. Im quite disapointed when developers don't make the same thing on both side.
"I can't pick the song in my playlist and on top of that I have to get premium to skip to the one I like, also there is no replay button so I can only listen to it once."
Love the music range and a availability. Have been a long time premium subscriber. But the app is just down right unreliable and completely ruins the experience. Won't stay connected to the Chromecast. Randomly stops playing music. Search function often inoperable.
"Mobile version is terrible, made a playlist on desktop with no issues, played it on mobile and discovered that I cant choose which song on the playlist to play. There is no option to repeat the playlist once its finished. Limiting the number of skips you have on your own playlist that you created is outrageous. I accidentally hit the ""hide song"" button because I didn't know what it was and couldn't figure out how to unhide my song from the playlist afterwards."
"It the least intuitive app in the history of Android. I cancelled my subscription. I can't find how to listen to playlist in the order I saved songs in, can't find how to pause from lock screen, and generally I tend to have a lot of problems with listing specific things, that do not follow recommendations."
I hate this app. But i have to use it because i can't listen to my podcasts otherwise. Create a more initiative UI or make a dedicated podcast app. Trash trash trash.
"Why is it that I can load YouTube and play HD videos from a feed and the experience of seamless, but Spotify takes forever to load a list of songs/podcasts and then hangs when the play button is pressed. I think I'm ready to cancel my family subscription and try something that actually functions on the most basic level."
"Ive been subscribed for over 3 years now, not sure where the premium value is...very slow ui, no EQ or even simple sound profiles, terrible shuffle that will repeat the same songs, very few library filtering options all along with countless ""updates"" that seem to strip features rather than add to the experience. $120+/year for what exactly? A privledge of never owning your music/songs where it can, and has disapeared from the service without warning. Keeps crashing. Not recommended for party use"
"Limited Skipping, bad UI and too much publicity. Forcing you to use premium to have a less terrible experience. Nope. Premium not worth the price."
New UI is terrible and a very unnecessary change in general. My artist pages are taking forever to load too. Best to switch back to the previous and superior UI. This isn't what I'm paying for at all. Update: UI continuously gets worse. Now I can't even get a full page of artists whose music I've liked unless I follow them. This app was so much better only two years ago.
The app would not shut down. I got a message on my phone saying an app was taking up all your resources. It drained my battery very quickly after that. I don't know why that happened. My phone hasn't been the same since.
It crashes way too often. 4/10 times music will not load and I'm required to restart my phone. Every month or so I have to uninstall and reinstall it for the app to work. They also seem to be behind the curve on features.
"Latest updates keep making the app worse. I've been a premium user for 4 years now and this is the worst its ever been. Not only can I not sort my music by artist alphabetically, the recent update removed all artists from my music. Whoever is designing this app is a moron."
I used the app for about 5 minutes before it frooze while I was listening to music and I had to restart the phone to get the music to stop. It also has less features than the computer app and is less intuitive to use. Deleted.
"Wouldn't be using except for their buying exclusive rights to my fave podcast - yay /s. resource hog. Nav for podcasts is bad, impossible to find d/l episodes. uninstalled the app to stop it from taking GBs. Posted solution is navigate to each episode individually to del it - bad UI. other apps with little money have addressed, so I'm not sure why Spotify with all of their stock money hasnt. This is basic usability. But I guess they might be too busy lining their coffers."
"The app used to work fine, but since last one month the performance of the app has been terrible. I keep getting logged out from the app and then it doesn't let me log back in, the screen just hangs at logging page. Also sometimes on opening the app, a blank black screen opens up with no content and just stays there. Dont know what change you guys made, but it has messed up what used to be a great, seamless UX. I have tried reinstalling the app that didnt fix the issue."
"Lacking simple functions of a normal music streaming app like shuffle, loop and playing individual songs. I know you need money but paying for basic functions is pretty overkill in my opinion. also why do you need my credit card info for FREE premium? so when i forget to unsubscribe you can take my money for a service i am not willing to pay? Also the ui is very unintuitive and hard to navigate. You disappointed me in almost every way. Definetly gonna be switching to SoundCloud."
"spotify. Is TERRIBLE! It doesn't play the songs I want it to, buttons dont work doesn't search song I want to listen to.. in fact it searches up songs the total opposite of what I want to listen to! I would rather use another app then spotify, and I only had it for 10 minutes and it already wasn't working for me! Terrible!"
"Few years ago it was fantastic app and streaming service. Then they started with ""updates"" and have ruined everything. Now the app hangs on load, no more support for older devices, streaming suddenly stops, daily mix became limited and non-stop music doesn't work. In addition, security of personal data is non existent at Spotify as random people on the web are illegally selling family invitations with owner's full details. Spotify is typical example of how great product can go down the toilet."
"Too many ads, no comment section. UI feels like it's from the 90s. Freezes after 20 or 30 minutes. And i thought the streaming CBS app was bad. Do not put your money towards this incompetence."
Experience is ruined by the adds and they keep asking you to upgrade to not be bothered by their aggressive advertising. I don't have to pay for less advertising /no advertising when alot of other music apps give it for free. Also being a free user doesn't mean you shove all the continuous advertising on our faces. 90 seconds of adds for every two songs we listen to without an option to close it is cheap marketing.
Such a worst app .. everytime I play my playlist after one song it start advertising what the heck it just ruins my mood soo much and this time I'm writing this in frustration that I want to delete this app. I'm not earning right now so that's doesn't mean that u have ruin mood of those who can't buy premium. Please reduce your ads it's too much now.
"I know that apps have to make these companies money somehow, but restricting users from doing something as simple as selecting a specific song to try and force them to get Premium is ridiculous. Why can't they just give us mandatory ads like Pandora instead of ruining people's music experience with unwanted playlists???"
Probably the cheapest application. It's showing ads every time I'm pressing the next button! I'm gonna wait only two day and uninstall it if continues working like a total garbage..
"Last update sux, do not update if you like to start your music from your ""songs"" options. I used to play what I wanted, now I cant. Do not update if you like your ""songs"" listing/options."
"This app is useless, it doesn't even let you create your own playlist and puts random songs in it. It is designed in a way that you have to get the premium. I am furious!!!!"
"i need help, why does my spotify playlist keep on shuffling? I really hate that, and i also want to listen to songs, but there is nothing i can do because the shuffle button is gone. I'm quite convinced that i would not use spotify alot in the future and i will not reccomend this app to family and friends."
"Honestly the experience isn't bad. Except for one infuriating ""feature"" that shouldn't be as it is. Why in the f*** is the option to hide a song between like and add to playlist? Two things I would do if I enjoyed a song. And why isn't there a confirmation message for if I accidentally press this brilliantly placed button? And why have I gone through an hour of support sites trying to reinstate this song to no avail? Horrible design on an app breaking function that's more akin to a bug."
Recently noticed songs just abruptly go to pause. Noticed people are having same issues. I use this service daily and it's becoming quite annoying. Any insight as to what's going on? Looking forward to your reply. Thank you very much
"Autoplay doesn't work most of the time. I have spotify premium, the autoplay button is turned on, and I have an internet connection. I don't know what the problem is."
"Did not work on a brand new ASUS Chromebook. After hitting the play button it automatically stops in milliseconds. Uninstall and reinstalling worked once, then the same problem. Not recommended at this time."
Every time I open the app it won't let me play music. When I press the play button it automatically pauses it. I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling but I have the same problem. I used to really like this app but now it's just disappointing. Only one star if this problem doesn't get fixed.
"Is stuck in loading albums, rather primitive search function, unintuitive navigation, inconsistent options. Have to reinstall the app almost daily."
Very disappointing. I pay for Spotify Premium. It refuses to play on any Google Home product. Pandora works perfect. If this is not resolved quick i will switch to Pandora that works seamless with Google Home and G Assistant.
Worst app for casting. It doesnt have straightforward cast button instead it enlists 6 options and none can be connectdd or it tzkes 15 mins if lucky to connect. They should learn from other streaming app.
"I am satisfied with the desktop version, but i'm having problems with the phone version since day 1. You can't skip more than 6 songs in your playlist unless you pay for premium, nor can you remove the songs spotify adds into your playlists without premium. Yes, they actually add songs into your playlists without your consent. The UI overall is very confusing on the phone version and it's a pain in the ass to control.Things got really money hungry on the phone version and I will not be using it."
Horrible UI... I use this app for years but I'm always lost trying to find different settings/options... Cast functionality is extremely unreliable...
"If i could rate this app zero stars I would. This app requires you to pay if you want the chance to even use it properly. There are moments where I am stopped from listening to what I want and Instead I am forced to listen to ""recommended songs"". Uninstalling this app was the best thing I've done yet."
"Who in the right mind, over at spotify, thought it was a good idea to put the ""hide this song"" button as the first button to press when you open the menu for a song? And right above the ""Add to Playlist"" button too. It has been ""Add to Playlist"" for months/years in that same spot, and you thought it was a good choice to switch it with the hide button?? Not just that, but once you hide the song, there's no option to undo it. Why would a music lover hide songs anyway? Really dumb update."
"Well, one star because of making the equaliser premium which was for free before, and even more recency in ads... I agree this app has best UI amongst others and I appreciate the efforts of developers too...but you see these two things became very annoying now-a-days"
Deceptive ! I was using free version of the app .A banner shows up offering one month free trial for the premium service.As it is required to set up a payment method I entered all the details required and to my surprise I was charged for the one month prepaid plan.On top of that I am still getting ads in between the skips.While I have already tried to contact support team for the issue I am still waiting for the response. I have even received a receipt of purchase in my email.I want refund.
"It used to be good but as they're ""constantly updating and improving it"" with their updates they're actually ruining the site over time. Honestly I wish they had just left it alone, if it ain't broke dont try to fix it. Site was great then they keep ""updating"" for no reason making things worse and worse. Absolute worst thing imo is it no longer tells you how many tracks are in your playlists. Cancelling subscription and trying out Apple Music"
"The absolute largest pile of excrement EVER.... Music is meant to calm and sooth...or to excite and inspire....this worthless shitpile did interrupt 3 out of the 10 songs I tried to enjoy...by the time my short ""audition"" was complete...I was livid with this invasive add- laden , self serving robo-turd... Oh f$%k....it even threw up an add to edit and continue with my review....so here ya go Never....NEVER, alow this ill-designed....whatever the f%co it is to enter your listening domain ..."
"Have been having issues with playback. The volume keeps fluctuating randomly. This happens on Windows as well as Linux and none of the suggestions on the community fix the problem. There is also no way to get in touch with tech support directly from Spotify. They really don't care. Another big caveat is the fact that the like button does not work in Wear OS, which is a shame because it would've been great to hit like on a song without having to unlock your phone for it."
"Horrible! I clicked on to Autoplay so it plays the next song similar to what I search and this option used to rarely work on me and now has completely stopped! I dont have time to make a playlist and I don't like to recycle. I cant deal with this! I restart, clear memory, search a solution, nothing! At Wits end! Fix this please!!!!!!! It ruins my day. I'm on premium."
HIDE THIS SONG FEATURE NEEDS TO GO. The amount of times I've hit that button instead of the add to a playlist button. Then I'm unable to find the song!
No stations like Sirius. I don't like to have to choose playlists again and again. Give me a station that had music I like that will play in perpetuity.
"When you pay for premium you expect a minimal service. Well I keep having problems when casting to chromecast or Google home speaker. Sometimes it connects but it disconnects right after, and other times the devices don't even show on the list to cast. Very disappointing since this has been a problem for quite a while now and Spotify hasn't fixed it yet."
"Its not working on the mobile data internet, it always requires wifi. Even though the speed is good. Kindly fix my bug. same exists in Spotify lite too. Thankyou Spotify."
Spotify is a shadow of what it used to be. I was a premium user for 5 years and watched in frustration as they ruined it. They don't listen to their user base and that's why I cancelled my subscription. You'd think a service that costs $120 a year would go above and beyond for their customers but it's becoming pretty clear that the shareholders are priority #1. Pretty pathetic for a company already making millions on advertisement and the intellectual property of others.
"This app was working, now it won't let me go to a certain latter to find a particular song. I have to go down through all my songs and anytime I try to go down it stops me from continuing!!"
"With the most recent update as of April 22, 2020. I can't play down a few songs from my download list without the app bringing me back to the first song (latest downloaded), and with all the bureaucracy involved in simply being able to report a bug specially (you guys don't jave a direct option to do just that) I'd give you a minus stars rating (if I could), for such terrible user experience."
"Spotify has been charging me $9.99/month for one year. To this day I am not considered a ""Premium Subscriber"" and am getting interuptions (while listening) asking me to sign up to be a ""Premium Subscriber."" I ask you, is this any way to treat a long term Spotify cutomer? Sincerely, Guitarjoe1046 Brooklyn, N.Y."
"I have Spotify premium and genuinely am upset about whats been going on with their software issues, if you swipe to change songs, the picture will change to the next song album but won't actually change songs. I have all my saved songs in the ""liked"" playlist and the playlist won't load offline. Others do, but not the main one. that's been happening for months, now you can't listen to your songs from the middle of your liked playlist because it will just go to the top of the playlist every time."
Don't like fact that it requires data all the time to assess songs I have saved on my play list. And you can't download the songs into your phone.
"The app freazes on the adds constantly, and when it works the adds are so loud listening with headphones will damage your hearing. (Same as tv adds quick turn it down)."
"This latest update (20th April 2020) is horrible! When playing from the liked songs ""playlist"", instead of queuing songs that were sequentially added, it takes your queue from the very top of the whole list again. This causes you to lose your place in potentially thousands of songs and basically forcing users to make playlists, or suffer through the made for you playlists which struggle to group together artists that actually make any sense if you like more than one genre of music."
"So this is a edit for a new problem, I've been trying to play my music and whenever I have to have an Ad play it goes all black and nothing happens. Honestly, I hate resetung my device over and over again or just waiting without any music. I hope for once you guys fix this or something because I dislike the quiet. I'm quite disappointed"
i have used this app quite a long time i was loving it so subscribe into premium feature and started download offline songs since i most often stay offline but then i realized some songs don't play after i download and after updating the app it starts downloading the playlist all over again and thats a big disappointment for me wasting so much of internet packs.. so I won't use this app anymore from now on..
"Bombarding of ads....so much so that it's unusable....plus the back button doesn't work to get rid of the ad banner u have to click on the on-screen dismiss button.... negligible collection of early 2000s, 90s, 80s, and so on...of both...English and bollywood movie songs and the pop albums. JioSaavn is leaps and bounds aheah in terms of song collection."
"Discountinuing premium until you pay artists a fair price for their music. Also, the app is way too heavy...other apps are under 1gb, this thing is 8 times that. See ya later! 🤘"
Crashes my phone on update because permissions keep changing - stopped recognizing my SD card even when I restored permissions. New UI is terrible. I don't want to follow artists if I've only saved an album from them and I have no way way to easily look at albums from artists or visa versa without following them. I've tried saving/downloading whole albums at a time and the individual songs don't show up in my liked songs playlist because I didn't individually like every song in the album.
Paying for a premium service and getting a budget app. The app keeps crashing at random times and requires restarting the app. Have tried reinstalling and no joy. I pay for the premium service so I can listen while driving. Having to stop every 5 minutes or so to restart it is not a premium experience.......
Awful UI. Basic usability is seriously flawed. Unintuitive. The back catalogue of available music is substantial but the program itself and experience is too awful to ever recommend to anyone.
"During the last month or so the app has started constantly freezing and then crashing. Can't access the menu, put songs in queue - nothing. Have uninstalled, reinstalled, updated to the most recent version(s) (which probably are the problem). Very annoying, since I have loved using Spotify since forever but if the bugs are not addressed soon will have to think about switching apps - I really don't want to be force quitting and restarting the app every two songs."
"What's the point in having a music app that stops playing when the phones screen turns off?? Pathetic... and what's the point of the shuffle play button if the music doesn't shuffle after the 1st song? There's so much where you guys went wrong, and for some reason you still raise your prices??? Oh yeah, I love to pay more for apps that lose quality... that was sarcasm"
"The app says it'll give you 30 minutes ad free, even if you don't press the No Thanks button, even listening to the ad and 3 songs latter it gives you another bloody ad again. It's a false of an app, don't always expect to listen to your music without ads for 30 minutes. Garbage app!"
"Recent updates have ruined this once amazing app. Playlists now restart from the top instead of going to the next song, and it takes ages to detect internet connection. Also randomly stops playing mid song. Updates just seem to add new bugs. Considering cancelling my family sub tbh, it's close to being not worth it anymore. They'll probably blame it on the pandemic but the issues started long before then. Very disappointing"
"Every time I download this app, I end up deleting it again. Cuz it's so frustrating not being able to create playlists fast. Like, I genuinely hate that I have to add one song per time on a playlist, I wish I could select five or eight songs from the same album and add them to the same playlist in one movement."
"Been paying for a premium subscription for years now, quite happily, until recently. The last update really messed a great service up! Tracks keep stopping, the app crashes every 30-60 secs! If it isn't fixed asap I will be looking elsewhere for a service that works the Spotify used to."
I accidentally removed my sd. Card and now I can't log in to the app. I used my email account but still can't log in to the app there are no real guidelines to help you restore your data. And if I retrieve my account all the songs I download will be gone and I have to download it again. I'm wasting my time and money.
"Just randomly interrupts songs and albums to play other stuff I've never heard. Never been a fan of Spotify's UX, but this bug is royally irritating."
"No way this is worth 15$ a month. Clunky interface. Shuffle sucks. Playlists suck. Won't keep playing music if I pick a specific track. If you do get it to, and searched for the wrong thing it will play more and more obscure music till you shut it off. In a place with low/no cell coverage (motorcycle on the highway), instead of switching to locally saved tracks until coverage resumes, it just stops playing music & then I have to stop. So useless. Need a ""just play #&$- music"" button."
"I noticed that Spotify stops playing automatically when I hit the close all apps button (on my galaxy s10 plus) and removes the icon from the notification area, too, ie completely shuts down along with all the apps"
"I dont know i have been using spotify since long time , but what i am experiencing now is some of my downloaded song is getting grey and not playable anymore which is quite upsetting and then the app automatically stops playing , for suppose i am playing in a party or so on it stops alot of time which is quite embarrsing , would like to bring this issue to your attention and request to fix this issue . Apart from the that everything is the best"
"Constantly deletes all my downloaded music; this is a recurrent problem that a lot of people face and Spotify aren't helping with it at all. Only allows me to download entire albums, even if I only want a few songs. This is particularly annoying as Spotify often only offers Deluxe versions of an albums; one album in particular is only available as a six hour long special edition, and I need to download the entire thing even though I only want to original tracklist. Terrible app, not worth it."
"Due to the current situation, I've recently had to adapt to a work-at-home environment that is much quieter than I am accustomed to. Given that I pay for a family plan for my boyfriend and I, it seemed like music would be a good solution until the most recent update. Now the app randomly shuts down unprovoked. Fix this!"
"Constant ads, low audio quality, awful UI, and worst of all; you can't even pick the music you want to listen to, worst music app of all time; stay away from this god awful app"
The app's shuffle playlist button is not working so I can longer listen to my playlist anymore I'm using the free version and I'm not convinced on the paid version being any better.
It sucks cuz I can't listen to certain songs and I have to buy premium for like everything and every song has to be a radio or something I search moonlight by juice wrld it gives me other songs and it always shuffles songs and I hate it cuz I can't even skip through the songs to get to moonlight
"spotify is literally the worst place to listen to music. it only lets you listen to songs it recommends, if you make a playlist it adds a neverending list of songs that you dont want and cant remove from the playlist, you cant play any songs you liked, only ever snippets of them, no matter what. spotify mobile is a garbage app with horrible confusing ui and frustrating unnessecary mechanics"
"I think the last update ruined the app. For the past few hours, the app couldn't load its home screen and even my library. I thought the problem might be my internet connection, but most of my apps seemed to be connecting well. What happened?"
"Ok so the lastest update ruined it. I can't play single songs, it only lets me preview them. I can't even skip songs in my playlist anymore. Do NOT download, its a waste of time and money."
"You can't skip songs anymore, you can't listen to a full album without shuffling around the songs like what's the use of having this app if some songs you don't like are recommended to you and you can't change. This updated app ruined the good experience I always had when using this and it's even complicated like hell."
"Rude and assumptive ads. Understandably limited free features, but griefs its app users. If I want to listen to a specific song there are places for that for free. UI is a bit hard to utilize as there are limited searching and organizing options premium or not. EDIT: The app also just sometimes stops working entirely and has a lot of stability issues. The only other thing I wish is that I could give it worse than one star."
I thought there was an issue with my phone and then I read the recent reviews! Spotify won't even open for the last few days. I am trying to update as we speak but this doesn't seem to be working. I shall me deleting and cancelling premium if this isn't fixed quickly!
"This app belongs to negative five stars rating. They give you an extremely horrible free user experience, to force you to pay them money to go premium. 'Premium' allows you to play the song of your choice instead of having to shuffle and entire playlist, when i can just find the single song on youtube. TL:DR - don't usr this unless you have premium"
The download to device option will randomly reset which storage to store the files to and download all the saved songs and albums all over again. When you set it to the storage which had your files it will still try and re-download the songs again. Is that a bug or is it a built in feature?
I only use it for podcasts since some of my faves became exclusive to Spotify. The UI is horrible for podcasts. It's difficult to find the episodes I have downloaded. Please make this more of a traditional podcast app if you're going to try to monopolize the market on that too.
This use to be the best app for music now it's a stupid app. The User Interface use to be very convenient and now it's all messed up with the updates. Many people are complaining regarding the UI but Spotify doesn't care. I will take my money somewhere else. Thank you for the past 3 years of music streaming. Good bye.
The music is great but the ads suck! Too many ads!! You ask me a question but I don't see a option for saying yes! Quit playing games people aren't stupid. Wanna give you a 5 but with the silly tricks I give you a 3. Stop Politican!!!!!
"When it works, it's great. However, this is rare, as there's always a new issue ruining the experience: this includes deleted playlists, issues with Google home mini, and currently, ""something went wrong, have another go?"" with a useless ""tRy AgAiN"" button. This is a paid service, figure it out Spotify!!"
"Takes 1000 years to load, if it all loads. I have incredible WiFi speed so it's just the app is terrible. Without premium you're heavily limited. If you make a play list they add songs to it and its annoying. Would be good if I could remove those song but the remove button doesn't even work and also would be nice to have a setting to turn it off."
"No features for free. If you don't want, or can't pay for the premium pack, your user experience will be frustrating. Try bandcamp instead!"
Extremely buggy with my songs and playlists constantly being greyed out without explanation requiring me to wait till I get home to redownload from my desktop or even reinstall the app and then redownload. Totally useless even with a premium account
I subscribed to Spotify because of recommendations and access to multiple playlist. Apart from that the UI has been pathetic especially for the last 2 months. The app takes so much time to even load downloaded songs and I don't understand why the app needs a strong Internet connection even for downloaded songs. The graph is just going down by the day.
"*Updated review* So the issue I'm having is Spotify can't deal with downloading updates to playlists and actually play music at the same time. Utterly annoying, especially in the morning to have Spotify cut out several times and I've been having this problem for months. * Original review. * Every day my music stops playing for no reason. In fact it even cut out as I wrote that. I've disabled all battery saving options, sleep options, the playlist is downloaded, yet for the first five minutes after leaving my house, Spotify will just stop, it says it's playing, then it might restart, but often it takes me to either open my phone, open solidity and start/ stop it, even shut down Spotify and restart Spotify (then it will just freeze up, requiring another closing of the app)."
Shameful organization. They send you promos for free trials. Than after you inquire about the charges they say that you used Spotify two years ago so you don't qualify. Even if it's for one of their products you didn't try. If you signed up in the past and sign up again after they offer you a promotion. They will charge you and refuse to reverse the charges. I hope this helps someone find a better music service provider that doesn't try to Rio of their costumers.
"Worked fine, 2 min later it froze & had to be closed. 2nd open it was solid gray. Tapped library. No responce. Tried closing again, and my phone froze for over 30 sec. I ordered this phone 3 months ago from Razer website and its never frozen. I've had premium for yrs, but every design change is either nonsensical or nonfunctional. The layout 5 yr ago looked better than all since, please stop ""fixing"" whats not broken. you're making it be broken"
Most of the time i reopen the app and am listening to a podcast i have to click on something else then back to the episode i was originally listening to. Sometimes i have to force quit the app several times before it plays anything period. I hate spotify with a passion and i wish the staff would fix this.
**I pay for premium** I can't find my spotify account info. I updated my new phone and the 2 emails I have both are loading the free play lists from another family member. If I can't find a solution to this by Monday I will be telling my bank to not allow payments to go through. Why can't you simply contact CS over issues like these???? Why do I have to leave a review and hope someone contacts me? * I need a number or email - with quick response - to help me with this issue.*
This app is really buggy. Don't know why I'm paying for premium when my content takes minutes to load and the app keeps crashing mid-listen. It's quite frankly very annoying at this point.
"Most people probably dont stay long on this app's UI, but its super bad. Not intuitive at all. And it lags like crazy when im manually clicking to shift songs to other playlists ---- Update: Best part, I cant even find the way to delete 1 song from my offline download. I can only remove the entire album from download. Why would you design something like that? The fixes i found online dont work because its a new version now. Genius."
"Well annoying that every half an hour i have to hear the quiet place advert 3 or 4 times, blasting through my headphones while im trying to work. And then theres that awful on the beach advert which infuriates me. Sort it out spotify. Or ill uninstall you."
"Limiting skips and making shuffle only etc on free accounts seems rather stupid. To me it seems Spotify cares about cash rather than quality, I much rather listen to my offline songs quite often. But also I recently discovered Spotify likes to put about 4 songs in a row that have absolutely no relation to what my playlist is, and I definitely did not add them into my queue/playlist."
"STOP!! DO NOT PURCHASE A SUBSCRIPTION TO SPOTIFY. If you are going to pay for a music service, use iTunes or Amazon Music Unlimited. This is one of the most poorly designed apps, and they have less of a selection than other platforms. The only reason i even came across spotify was because of a free 6 month subscription. If I plan on purchasing a music streaming service in the future, it will definitely not be Spotify. If i could give it 0 stars, I would."
Keep on saying I'm offline when everything else including my heavy data mobile apps that requires online access is working perfectly fine. This is one of the reasons why I removed my premium membership with you. I don't get my money's worth.
I used to use this app alot of time then it added songs that I didn't put in the playlist and then I skipped some songs and then it sead that I needed premium for me to skip it was better how it was now you all ruined the app just for money good job you ruined everything.
Who's bright ass idea was it to make it so that you have to BUY PREMIUM TO CHOOSE ANY SONG... I mean what a rip off! Ik we dont buy anything but literally that's so stupid! If it's like this then I ain't even gonna bother with spotify and I'm get another app. What a waste of building up those playlists just to be stuck on shuffle.
Search option is really pathetic. I had opted out of Gaana app just because it lags a lot. Spotify is comparatively good. But i hated to search any song on this as it required more specific song name.
"Almost makes me wish I had an iPhone still. They treat the Android app like the stupid little brother and only add features when people start to notice iOS has them and we don't. Not to mention the terrible UI. While I'm here, it's obvious they need a better design team and streamline over all platforms. INCLUDING WINDOWS (they don't even get canvas or the behind the lyrics. This is what I pay $10 a month for? Bad on Android Wear too."
"Not impressed. I couldn't sign up with my gmail accounts so I registered with Facebook. I wanted to update to Premium but the page turned Spanish?? Tried on the website but the I Am Not A Robot function kept refreshing instead of processing... So, I decided to continue with a free FB account...until today when it took uninstalling and reinstalling the app for a notification to pop up about not being able to use Spotify abroad?? Was really excited to treat myself so I'm quite disappointed..."
"The music experience is totally ruined by the constant ads. I literally get 3 ads all at once just after listening to 2-3 songs. Just unacceptable. Plus, those ""Watch this ad and listen to uninterrupted music for 30 min"" ads are really annoying and they keep showing up after each song until you watch the ad. It's like Spotify is forcing us to see the ads. Would have given 5 stars if ads were less like other apps (Saavn, Wynk Music)."
"I purchased premium version. All downloads deletes everyday automatically. I need to download them again. And sound quality is the worst among most apps. There is nothing except an incredible UI and plugins. There is no option in settings to stop deleting automatical deletion. No specific support for premium users. Bad Sound Quality even on choosing ""Very High"". Good User Interface. Nothing else. And there is no option to download a specific song. You need to download whole playlist. Amazing!"
I like the wide variety of music and its easy to use but please remove the shuffle play and the automatic addition of songs to old albums and MY playlists. This is my only complaint but its also a dealbreaker. Its very well designed but fix this issue for non premium users. Add an extra ad or something but please let me listen to the songs I SPECIFICALLY picked out
Was my favourite app for listening to and publishing my music.. Now songs pause randomly and to unpause the track you have to reopen the app and the song just plays from the beginning. This happens pretty much every song now. My playlists wont download or if they do they dont stay downloaded. Its really upsetting I used to live on this app and this new update has ruined it.
I paid for premium. Its fraud. Now app is showing offline. Even when all other apps are working and i cant even go to my account page show password incorrect. Password is 100% correct. I cant even cancel my subcription. I feel tricked. I need my money back. They dont have number to call. How can i get quick help.
"Stop with the ""upgrade to premium for ad free listening"" campaign, it seems immature. Advertisements are a vital part of marketing. Ads help organizations raise awareness of their fields, services and products, and at the same time, ads help build a valuable connection between the buyers and the suppliers. Hence, without ads, there will be a void in the complete marketing process."
"The app is unresponsive. Can't pull up podcast or any songs which I search for. For $10 per month, maybe it's time to build an app that actually works?"
"Sometimes I wish there was zero stars, anyway this app was a huge letdown, it never played the music I wanted it to play and if it did, it would only play for 4 to 5 seconds, I know I know... Your probably going like "" Shes just dumb, she's probably just Pressing the 5 second listen button"", but I'm serious, in the playlist after I listen to it once it wouldn't repeat, it would play the suggestions over and over again, if this is meant to happen they you are just evil."
App force closes everytime I exit the app or lock my phone. Even when I'm using other apps that dont require sound it force closes. I have to leave it open on the app for it to even work. Never had a problem before.
"After latest update the App stops playing after 3 songs, won't connect to smart watch anymore. Premium family account with no function. After the latest update, I lost the 4x1 widget showing what was playing with the play, forward, backwards buttons. please bring this back."
You ruined spotify with the last update. When looking into artists I see only songs on my playlists. Really!!!! When I go into an artist name I need to see only one song - without any option to see all their work.. you took all my music this way. Not to mention hurting artists discovery of music. You can put my favored songs on top. Provide an additional link. But you just hid it!!
"I have premium but looking for best alternative. Was great when 1st installed. Great selection of music. Now always loses connection with any (wifi) speaker then won't play once disconnected. Reconnecting you hear the phone connect but spotify says it's still connecting.The volume is low no matter what I do. Lock screen controls don't work. They need to hire the app designers from Tidal, that app works great and best music quality."
"Latest update now has the app crashing at random. Absolutely ruins it for me. Unlike many people, although I preferred it before, I don't actually mind the new UI. As a listener of Podcasts this has helped me personally. But the constant crashing is a total deal breaker. Fix this now .. Update - After months there has still been no fix to the app crashes or much improvement to the UI. I now plan on finding another app. Spotify is no longer worth the money"
"The only reason I stay is because my library is too large to rebuild somewhere else. - There is not a way to distinguish between artists of the same name. There are at least 5 artists known as ""Joe"" just because I like 90's r&b Joe doesn't mean I also like ragae Joe or Spanish singing Joe.. but that is who gets recommended to me on a regular basis. I have had to block some of my favorite artists because of all of the incorrect recommendations. - There is not a good way to view new albums."
"I was a big fan of the shuffle button! With the latest update whenever I hit shuffle the song pauses. PLEASE fix this. I should be able to hit the shuffle button and it should play a random song, NOT PAUSE IT."
"For a free app it's amazing, however when I'm told I get ""30 minutes of ad free music"" for watching a ad I expect more than 10 damn minutes. Also hate how you have to stop everything to unlock your phone, open the app, and full screen the song if you want to click that button- or risk at least 5-10 minutes of ads."
"Horrible update. When you press the shuffle button, instead of shuffling it just pauses and plays the song. Theres no point of my premium membership if I cant even shuffle my playlist."
"What's happened to the Shuffle Play button? I want a button that randomly starts playing a song from the selected playlist no matter when it's pressed, I do not want a button that randomly plays one song and then solely acts as a pause button. Now if I want to change the song, I need to start playing another playlist or manually select a song, which defeats the entire purpose of having a shuffle play option in the first place. Totally inconvenient, fix this issue ASAP."
It was ass that you had to get preuim just to listen to your songs in order and how they add song's to your playlist. I don't like that because I like how my music and I don't want it adding some music I don't like.
"It used to be good, when I started with it in 2017. But now, it stops playing by itself when I turn my screen off, and quite often will open the app and start playing stuff. Another thing is it starts playing the second I open the app. I use Google Play Music more often than Spotify now, because they don't have these glitches, and if they don't have something, I can upload it from my desktop to stream off any device. It's also not as quiet and I can customize the artwork."
"They pay artists almost nothing and there is a HUGE lack of options. Hard to easily find yr friends there and to find again people you follow, as the software its also super unintuitive. Artists profiles are unhelpful, search engine is completely basic and without options and we have to pay 10£ a month for it!"
"Why keep making the app worse? Why is ""find in playlist"" not visible at the top all times? Why can't we multi-select songs in a playlist? Very questionable design decisions that make the app very cumbersome to use."
Trialing Spotify Premium but music cuts off after only 3 or 4 songs played requiring constant turning back on to continue listening but give up after a few times with the same thing happening over and over very frustrating don't think i will bother with it any more
"Crash after crash after crash. This update broke the app. Also, Why can't you triple tap media button on your headphones to play previous song? Just like every other music app does...."
"It's good for long bus rides. ok, quick question, how do I stop having a bunch of Christian music forced on me? I don't listen to it, don't like it in the least. I listen to rock and punk. But every time I look, it's some Jesus this Jesus that song playing. I would really like it to stop."
"Keeps force quitting as soon as I open the app. Have tried restarting app and phone. Have also cleared data, cache, uninstalled, and reinstalled app. Please fix!!!"
"Comparing to the app for iOS, this version is terrible and very unfriendly to use! It's missing the swipping to add to queue or search quickly for a song in playlist. The equaliser is equally horrible, there are only very limited options. And I do not appreciate changing order in list of playlists based on the last listened, it takes more time to orientate and search in it."
Theres too many ads I cant even listen to 2 songs without being ambushed by 3 ads and then repeated again in the order it really ruins the flow. Sure I understand you're trying to pay the artist by making us Spotify users listen to ads but recently theres been too many.
"A great app until the free trial ends, yes it's a free premium trial,but once it ends you CAN'T play your own songs without the app giving you 3000 more that you don't want with ads on top of that, I would of recommended but if this is the stuff you need to put up with for music you may as well just pirate it, offline, no ads, and for free, Instead of, always online, lots of ads, and you can't even find the song because of the ""You added, We added"" feature designed to annoy you, DO NOT RECOMMEND"
"Nothing works anymore. I can't even log in anymore. Its either slow, crashes, or says I have no internet connection. What do they do about it? Nothing, but update the UI. But everytime they update the UI everything gets worse. Get better Spotify, thats why I switched to Apple Music"
I hate it can't even listen to full songs and every time I want to listen to a song It just says shuffle play and when I press the shuffle play button it comes up with all these random songs and my playlist I add songs then for some reason the app just adds stupid songs but I don't know why I can't listen to full songs 😠😠😠😡😡😡
This app for Android is genuinely awful. Constant crashing or takes forever to load on my S10. You force close the app then it starts playing! How can it be this bad??? Update: multiple updates and this app is still awful.
Podcasts are awful. The layout is terrible. The playback speed options are stupid. At 2* speed you need more frequent speed controls not less. Jumping from 2* to 3* with no options in between is the stupidest design choice I've seen since WhatsApp not letting you use the app on your tablet and phone at the same time. I've moved off Spotify for podcasts now and will be cancelling my premium subscription.
"Requires internet. While driving, songs go in and out because of bad data signals. The apps that require no internet to play are so much better!"
"The worst music app going. How can this be one of the best? Pause / play button blanks you, the song stops out of nowhere and starts again, all that bs about shuffle only unless u pay £10 a month, I redownload now and again, then delete soon after. The worst music phone app I've come across. Not worth the stress."
"Beyond the quiet breach of user accounts and lack of 2 step authentication, I now get the spinning wheel more often than I ever get to listen to music via my premium acct (on an Android). Frustrating and a waste of time and money. Used to be great, now I go to other services before I bother trying Spotify."
My music randomly stops playing and pause isnt hit or anything. And then when I hit the pause button it starts the song over again from the beginning not the part it even stopped playing on...This even happens during commercials. Been using Spotify for years and I've never had a problem until recently
The app is hot garbage on Android 10. The play pause buttons and skip track are super inconsistent and the music just keeps playing regardless of if you pressed those buttons or not. It only seems to be an issue on Wi-Fi. Works normally over 4G. This app isn't worth premium.
"I'm uninstalling it while I am still a premium member, Why? 1. Music Quality doesn't change for premium. 2. A wide range of Music isn't available. For e.g Coldplay isn't there. 3. Costly as compared to other music streaming apps 4. For non - premium ads are very long. Ruins mood very often. 5. Sometimes pages don't load. 6. Every album/artist page shows only 10 songs only for 11th you need to go to the 10th and next. Not user friendly for sure. 7. Car interface is useless just zooms up font."
"So continuing my review, I don't know why this search problem happens, but It is very annoying... I was wondering whether you could write a separated search method for the library. Thank you! And keep on doing Spotify! It is great!!"
"The last few months, i've noticed that the app seems to cut out like 10 or so seconds into a song and when i press the play button again, the song starts from the start. I pay for premium, i shouldn't have to put up with bad connections. Please fix and you'll get a five star rating."
"The 'shuffle play's button doesn't make any sense, it plays in an order where songs repeat each other multiple times even though there is still songs left in the album. (I HAVE PREMIUM) I only use it because this is the only one that is usable. But it is still trash. Thank you."
It was amazing. My favourate music app. But the new update ruid it. I can only shuffle and i can only skip 6 times an hour. If you go back to before the update it would be 5 star now its 1. I will no longer use this app
This was by far the greatest app until the recent update. Please go back to the original format!! You clearly didn't Beta test this most recent update because it looks like a twelve-year-old designed it.. I'm not an 80 year old man I don't need the font to be Ridiculously big as you have made it
I can't play the song I want. It's always shuffling. it's irritating. you also only have s limited skip then it offers you to buy the premium. Why can't I just play the song I want? Give me an answer. (Also theres no play button to what you want to play there's only shuffle play)
"I have found my experiance with spotify continues to get worse and worse over the years, across multiple devices. It just doesn't work, in random ways. I can't listen to certain artists unless I restart the app multiple times. Certain songs will just stop working. It's rare that I can have a listening session without at least 1 restart. I won't be continuing my subscription."
Extremely buggy. Had an issue where certain songs just wouldn't play and I had to delete my account and make a new one which meant I lost my listening history. Also required I spend two hours with customer service. Now certain artists won't have all their songs displayed if I click the artist from my recently played list. Tried to get help but customer service first tried to pretend it was a feature (weird feature to only apply to some artists) then just ended the chat. Wasting my time and money
This app sucks and I have a bunch of reasons for that 1. You cant play your songs in a playlist in an order you like 2. The stupid app keeps adding songs u dont want to hear to 3. Ads would pop out suddenly 4. There is only a stupid shuffle play button but u can listen to a song directly
"I'm not able to login with my Facebook account, I've tried a lot many times, last month and this month. It's quite frustrating because I'd have to create new playlists if I now use my email to login. Is this a known issue?"
Dreadful app made purely off greed once was good when none premium meant just unable to download music and listen offline that I understand but now adverts every couple songs or less only six skips a day and forced shuffle play I say this directly to the app maker you ruined a good app through your own inconsideration and greed because forcing people to shuffle play taking away the skip option and adding a price to it that's not cool
Not a stable user experience. So irritated with Albums and songs getting disappeared. No idea why. Thinking twice if I will continue my subscription.
"On my LG G6 I routinely have issues with being unable to find downloaded songs after the phone shuts off due to low battery. It will redownload the songs with the old versions taking up space, which then requires me to delete the app to remove the downloaded songs. This has happened multiple times, but most recently while traveling out of country with limited wifi or data, so I was unable to listen to music. I will be cancelling my subscription soon and finding a new app."
My Spotify keeps hanging whenever I hit the option button to add to a playlist or share a song. I've reinstalled the app a couple of times. Please look into it
"Absolutely terrible experience. Spotify has the worst UX I've ever seen in music streaming services, and I've tried them all. Queue management in particular is a joke. Such a shame; and I don't expect anything to change since Spotify pays zero attention to their users."
"Good app ruined with comercials. They say free account has 30 minutes of music without commercials which is not true. After every song I get commercials and it's always the same, stupid, boring ""pay for our premium"""
"Been paying for Spotify since like 2009, the last year it has been a dumpster fire due to instability with normal playback and Chromecast. Please start spending effort on stability and performance rather than moving buttons around in the layout."
The UI is so bad. Whoever designed this hasn't looked into UX patterns for music players. It makes no sense how things are queued up and seems to play things in random order unless you follow some obscure ritual before hand. If it wasn't for the collection of music I would have gotten rid of this frustrating app eons ago
"This app is impossible to use. You can't go 10 mins without getting bombarded by ads. It forces you too get premium by making the app virtually impossible to use. It comes up with: WATCH THIS QUICK AD TO GET 30 MINUITS OF AD FREE MUSIC"" and I get a two minute ad and than 5 minuits later Guess What?!?! I get 5 ads straight. If you want to search for a song you must have punctuation correctly used and letter to letter you must get the name right. Do not get this app get something better instead!!!"
"I understand if you dont pay for premium you'll have to listen to ads but honestly this has become ridiculous. Every 2-4 songs I'm stuck with a minute to a minute and a half of ads, even though they clearly state ""Please watch this ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" its getting to the point I'm ready to completely uninstall and give up on spotify. It genuinely seems more like they're trying to inconvenience you enough to shovel out your money"
"I have a problem with the app , i keep trying to share the songs on my iG story but ther is no share on "" Instagram story "" button , i have been literally trying forever and i even reinstalled both Instagram and spotify but none of this worked!!"
Wow that UI is absolute garbage. Why cant I move back to a previous song in shuffle olay? Why cant i see a searched olaylist before starting it? Why is it so hard to get back to the player?
"App quitting out within seconds of opening since this morning (1-10-20). I love my Spotify app & have found it easy to use & navigate. But even after uninstalling & reinstalling today, it won't stay open for longer than a second or two. I have a Pixel 3a & my app is on auto update."
"Ads are ridiculously loud compared to music. UI is also really strange. When I go to some album and click shuffle play, it plays completely unrelated music"
"Update sucks. It keeps stopping mid streaming if app doesn't remain open. So annoying. I have to ""reactivate it"" by hitting a side button..."
Brilliant app but lacking features If you're coming from Apple iPhone you will notice these difference: No swipe to queue You can't search by scrolling up on liked songs It essentially feels like everything is designed to take an extra click compared to iphone. I'm a software developer; there is absolutely no reason for this other than apple is paying them for a better user experience Really disappointing. Give android users the same experience and I will give you 5 stars. We pay same money..
"Most recent update constantly states I am offline when I am not, closing and reopening only thing that works, genuinely annoying, please fix asap I pay $15 a month for this. Edit: Still no fix 1-7-2020, thanks so much for listening"
ISSUE : when i click on 3 dots on right side on track or top right whole application freez and it could not play next track even i touch on another buttons nothing happens on notification bar we cant change or play songs everything has stoped nothing works please solve this as soon as possible
Theres so many issues with this app and i will be discontinuing my subscription. 1.App always says I'm offline when im not and i have to restart it to play music. 2. Search feature is no longer available by swiping down. Need to go through a three step process to search for a song. 3. Same thing with queuing songs process. Galaxy s10+
"Unfortunately the app doesn't let you see the song history of what you have played, or what has been autoplayed by the app 'radio'. Because of this it is a rubbish app when driving car; I would like to check the songs I have heard at the end of my trip and I cannot be distracted from driving the car trying to favourite / playlist songs I like whilst driving. This is a very poor design omission, as alternative platform apps do show the 'just heard' playlist history."
"The new update is about as appealing as roadkill. artists are not alphabetical unless you follow every artist in your library. UI is not user friendly in the slightest and trying to find specific songs in your library will cause an aneurysm. if you haven't updated yet do youself a favour and don't. if you have, go download an older version. seriously. Who at spotify approved this update? Update: Gave it months to be fixed. Still hasn't. Switching to apple music. Screw you spotify"
"As of the newest update, my music stops randomly every few minutes, and the player doesn't update when I change songs. The play and skip buttons work, but the song doesn't change. My watch doesn't update either, if I start the music from the watch, it plays the song it was last stuck on. The only fix I've found is restarting my phone every day. It's been the most frustrating experience having spotify for the past month"
"I've been a long time user of Spotify, but lately it's become ridiculously glitchy and I have to reinstall the app at least once a week. It refuses to load songs or will let me listen to the first 10 seconds and freeze, requiring it to be closed and reopened multiple times before it mysteriously begins to work again. This is not what I pay my subscription fee for."
Music fine. But app sucks pause button dont work and always says I lose connection and have to reboot app. Annoying when I pay whatever the subscription fee is a month
It was better before it changed because now you can't play individual songs or play your play list in order which is annoying because there are some I really like and others are on there for friends so I can't choose to play the ones I want. You have to let the songs play they go to your notifications at the top to skip it. I appreciate that they have all the songs I like but I can't play them the way I want to wich is annoying because I find this app very helpful but they ruined it. DON'T GET😡
"The music stutters and nothing seems to fix it, , the app controls the volume on its own and takes it down without me changing any settings or touching the volume buttons, and I'm premium!!!"
Have been using this App for years happily. Latest update has resulted in songs cutting out at 30-40 second mark for one second. Ruining experience. I'll be cancelling if this isn't resolved asafp
Would be able to have a feature that toggles off the automatically playing of music if bluetooth is on when in your car. Edit: Audio on app is awful...is way to quiet.
"Perfect premium app for ruining parties, gym workouts and any kind of musical appreciation attempt. Glitches out every 5 minutes and pauses whatever you are listening to, forcing you to stop whatever you are doing and go back to your device to resume playing the music. Juat great 👌"
Maybe I'll get a quicker response through here than email. I received an email @******* about an offer to get Spotify for 3 months at $9.99 and I would receive a free Google home mini. I place the order for Spotify and for the free mini device and was charged the full amount for the mini device. It said I qualify for the promo & it would be added at the end of the transaction and it wasn't. This is the order number *********
The new update completely ruins everything. It adds it's own stupid music to my playlist and it's impossible to play a single song without hearing shuffled music first and hoping that your song will play next.
"Painful to use; hardly intuitive at all: 1-Users cannot change the order of songs in playlists by pressing, holding and moving up or down; or even by clicking the three dots next to each song. I had to Google how to change their order, and we all know that nowadays, if an app needs a user manual, it is broken. 2-Please, I beg you to stop throwing in random songs in the middle or ending of my playlists. There is a reason I did not add those reggaetton songs to my classic music playlist."
I cannot edit my playlist. It hangs everytime I tried to click the edit button to remove the songs of my preference. All the time.
Help Spotify keep saying i was off line and wouldnt open. I uninstalled and reinstalled and now Ive lost all my music libraries. I signed up for Premuim a few days ago and was trying to get in to try it out. Where has my account gone. I requested new password and log in but that didnt work either.
Not working. I dont ever log out but when i went to use the app it had logged me out. I entered my information and it said it was wrong. So i tried going through facebook that didnt work either. So then i clicked on the help button and it said ut sent me an email havent recieved it yet must be coming by regular mail.
"When did they become so greedy for money? I've had the regular subscription (free) for a while now and they keep asking me to upgrade to premium, they say listen to a quick ad for 30mins of uninterrupted music but when I listen to the ad or watch the stupid video they play 3 songs and start with back to back ads again. Last time I checked 3 songs arent 10mins long each. We get it it's a business and all you want is money. But when it's to annoying I'm just going to delete the app not upgrade."
"I am changing my rating from three stars to one. I've used this app for quite a while and after trying to open it a few minutes ago it said I was logged out and when I tried to log in it said my password was incorrect when I know for a fact it was the right one. I tried to reset it, but that was a joke because the reset link doesn't work. It says ""link has already been used"". I tried this FIVE TIMES. So, do I never get to hear my playlists again? Will this be fixed?"
"I ""want a break from the ads"", but when I pull up the app to claim my 30 minutes of ad free music, it just continues the music. Ruins the experience."
Issues with Samsung Note 10 (Not just me). Music keeps stopping and requires closing app and cache of device to be cleared for it to work again. App will also give an error saying it is disconnected from the internet when this isn't the case. Issue has persisted through the last 2-3 updates without being fixed.
"I have subscribed to premium service, but I don't find any advantage other than good quality streaming. Downloading songs is a futile exercise, because everytime I turn my data off it automatically logs me out and I have to download all the songs again. Everytime!!! And since my last update, the audio pauses after 5 seconds as soon as the screen is turned off. I have to keep pressing the power button to keep playing the music. Please fix these ultra irritating issues. Else your app is useless"
"ATTENTION SPOTIFY COMMUNITY How has Spotify not yet fixed this issue! Spotify WAS great..... but now: The 2019 ""fix"" update which redesigned the editing playlist look is SO bloody annoying...If you find a song you want out of a playlist which you are playing, when you toggle and edit the playlist it should come up GREEN to signal you are playing it like it used to! It doesn't! I noticed so soon after the update came out. How has spotify not fixed this already! So stupid! Fix it!"
"Are you serious??? There's no way to delete a playing song from a current play list... Actually, Spotify mobile app brings one of the worst user experiences I ever had. I have more than 1000 songs in my play list. How do you suppose I should find a specific song by scrolling the list to delete it? There's no even a search function across the play list you are editing. And what about song lyrics?"
"Great service but the latest update has wrecked it. App thinks it's offline more often than not. This is happening across multiple android devices, not just mine. Come on Spotify please remedy quickly. Premium family customer."
"Seems to forget I'm connected to the internet with annoying frequency. Also randomly errors when selecting albums. Back button sometimes doesn't work either. Not as reliable as the Google Play Music app, but I have a free trial for 6 months so I'll suffer through it as it's free."
"17/12/2019: Streaming keeps stopping and restarting when playing in background. Latest version installed, required access granted. Payed account used only on one device. This is getting more annoying than the free version of youtube."
"When the app is minimised, sometimes it does not go to the notifications bar and thus the music stops playing once the screen is turned off. Spotify also used to not stop playing music when i press ""close all apps"", instead only closing when swiped away from the notifs bar. Also, filtering a playlist is very inconvenient now (requiring 2 extra taps to search for songs). Sucks that I've been paying for a product that has only gotten worse over time! 😡"
Why change the app. I can't search any full song at all. You have made it so difficult to use... everything I add to my playlist is 10 to 20 seconds of a song. You ruined some thing good. Thanks Spotify for turning your app into these new updated hard to use apps .....
"I'm highly disappointed at the Premium version with the loss of the ""do not play again"" button along with the supposed constant loss of a connection when I have have not just wifi but unlimited data. It's quite annoying to be paying for a service tha is honestly quite terrible now."
"Everytime I open the app now it says no ""internet connection available"" so I have to restart it, then it works fine, however this is everytime I use it. Also when I'm playing something and my screen locks it'll automatically stop playing then as soon I press any button it'll start playing again... then repeat the same process. Using this app is getting very tiring and long. It never used to be like this please fix the issues.I'm paying for a service, I expect it to be of a certain standard🙄"
"Why can I not pick a song that I want to play without getting Premium instead of using the stupid ""shuffle play"" button and not getting the song I want anyway? It's so annoying, I only get a ""preview"" of the song. 😡"
"I don't understand why the advertisements gotta be so loud and the music so quiet Slipknot , FFDP, no metal I listen to comes close to the advertisements I actually blew a blue tooth speaker from a dumb advertisement I don't mind the advertisements just PLEASE take it down a db or two Update Getting rid of this junk app I take back my one star n give it two big sh!ts !!"
"I love Spotify but they've seriously got to fix this filter bug. When I search/filter in my Liked Songs and play a song, the next song that plays isn't the next song through what I filtered but the next song in my overall liked songs list. Super annoying problem they need to fix! It's ruining the Spotify experience as this is how I've always listened to music"
"Doesn't let me play one song at a time. Instead, there is shuffle play. I kind of want a play button or an option to view your playlist and pick an indivisual song."
"Horrible UI experience. Know bugs that still pass through updates like ""no internet connection"". I'm in the market for another music streaming app. Spotify let me know when you fix yourself."
"The infamous ""You are offline"" bug is absolutely infuriating and ruins the entire experience. And also a bug when when using spotify connect with a streaming box it connects but refuses to play. I've been a premium user for years and I've paid good money for the streaming box and it simply refuses to start the music. This is unacceptable."
I've begun paying for this app and since its last update it now stops if my screen turns off. As soon as I push the wake up button it then comes on. What the hell is going on. Please fix or at least tell us how to fix it
"New UI is awful, and Spotify connect has no limit abilities. What this means is anyone on your same school or public wifi can connect to your phone and interrupt your listening. Yay!"
For some reason spotify seems to pause itself when my screen turns off. This does not happen all he time but is extremely frustrating have checked and no update required. uninstall and re install fixes it for a while but pretty annoying having to do this all the time as I then have to re download all my playlists. Otherwise spotify is great PLEASE FIX THE PAUSING ISSUE!!!
"Good service, garbage app. The app constantly says ""no internet connection"", pauses songs in the middle of a track, jams up when it connects to my truck, stops playing randomly and pushing play, next, or previous song has no effect until I close the app and restart, takes almost 2 mins to load up sometimes but sometimes starts right away, takes up to 1 min to recive button inputs (pause, next song, back 30 seconds in a podcast), says I don't have songs downloaded when I do...I pay for this?!?"
"This is quite frustrating. 1. Suddenly the app doesn't connects to internet, it starts showing ""Internet connection not available"" 2. Cannot access spotify website also, it shows ""DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN"" 3. I uninstalled and trying to log-in but cannot as it shows again and again internet issue 4. Internet is fine 4g LTE network Now, how should a subscriber get his account????? Please respond"
"Unreliable. Daily fails to detect internet and then requires I restart my phone. I have reinstalled it, which only provides temporary relief. No other app performs (or fails to perform) like this."
"Can't use the three ""dot"" buttons at all. So no queue, add to playlist-function.. Then the app crashes. Every single time."
"Used for nearly 10 years... Deleting. The app itself is unusable now been getting progressively worse for months. Can never connect to my streamer first time, usually have to reset the app. Constantly says im not connected to the internet but with a quick restart its fine again for a few minutes. Its a joke. Moving to amazon or itunes. Lost a valuable customer."
"Pos, with its lack of normalizing volume, specially between music and ads, and Via Bluetooth the volume is very quiet when compared to any other sound/app opened at the same time."
"It doesn't work properly, whole time stop the songs automatically and the phone is blocked, this is to annoying. I have uninstall Spotify 2 time and install it again but still with same problem. I got Premuin."
So this app says im offline even though i have an internet connection and refuses to play my play lists. Yet at the same time i can listen to music via I heart Radio which is hands down a better app. Also this app raises the volume to the max setting everytime theres an ad. I listen with ear buds. Can you say lawsuit?.
"This app is a joke. Whether it be the app randomly crashing, the app freezing if I change songs to quickly, albums disappearing for no reason, music not playing if I switch from offline to online, generally slow and unresponsive - the Spotify app functions more like an amateurs first app rather than the largest steaming platform on earth. Genueinly horrible."
"You need premium to do literally anything. It's so unexplanitory that I nedkeded to watch a tutorial on YouTube, it shows how good your app is when you need to watch a tutorial on how to use it because the app doesn't give you one and requires a paying service to do anything"
"It keeps telling me I'm offline. Even though the button shows online. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I'm totally fed up, it's been over 4 days of this now!"
"I used Spotify for quite some time now and even though not all the music I like is there, its a decent provider. Unfortunately, since a few weeks, the app keeps telling me that I'm offline while I'm not. Support went through many scenarios but cannot fix it. They do not want to refund me for the time the app is not working or provide me with details for a temporary account to use. As a premium Spotify user I expect to use the app without complications and if they arise to be compensated for it"
"Cant play songs at all! Everytime i want play a song, it swap to another song of a playlist! So annoyed! Wasting time for just searching a song to listen and it played for 3 secs and jumped randomly to a new song!!! What the heck!? Can you just let the song i choose to play normally!??? Already tried to added it to my own playlist with only that song but it still play another song!??? Why is that!?? So frustrated ansd wasted time!!! Cant fine play button as well!!! Only shuffle play!!! Gave up!"
"Awful app, devs keep making random changes that only hurt the user experience. Songs will randomly stop playing when my phone screen is off/ songs refuse to download and these issues are never addressed."
The app keeps stopping the music and will say that internet connection is not available. Since it seems like many people have the same issue I hope they fox this quick
"Worst ever. Gonna trick you in every way to pay to go premium. Works well for the 2 first months and then everything starts bugging: can't find your playlist, spotify adds tons of unwanted songs to your playlists, says your are offline when you constantly select online, buttons in settings disapear. It's a really bad joke."
"Every update consistently makes this app worse. From technical things (constantly saying offline when I'm online) to ux things (removing long press shortcuts from certain screens, but not others) This app is a mess"
Very buggy. Very poorly made offline mode. Deletes downloaded music at random. Only reason I'm keeping this service is because I'm too lazy to build my whole library again...
"Keeps glitching and hanging.... Makes the experience extremely unfulfilling and quite frustrating to be honest(note:this issue came up recently, worked fine until 3 days ago)"
There new update sucks I tried to listen to just my normal playist but it changed to a whole different song I did not want! I just wanted to draw while playing my music not music o never wanted in there. It ruines my focus on things
I had an iphone before. And spotify was better there. Its obvious you guys work with apple because for years we've been asking for fluid gestures and other features. Worst music app ever DO NOT download if you are on android
If i could give this app a -5 i would the creators dont care about the people who actually use this app only the people who pay for premium i would be listening to my songs and then all of a sudden a random song pops up that is awful so i skip but i only have the luxury to skip 6 or 7 songs a day and they add songs to your playlist and no matter how many i delete the list of dongs they add go on forever do yourself a favor and dont get this app unless your wiling to pay the every month.
"I have never experienced so many kinks in a app like this one. I don't know what they did to the new version but it constantly says I am offline. I am tired of following the suggestions of uninstalling, reinstalling or messing with the offline button. I shouldn't have to be frustrated everytime I want to listen to spotify. I am sad, I do love spotify but i am tired of being ""offline."""
"Spotify, you are killing me. Last week if anyone had asked I would have given you a 5 star rating, I love this app! But in the last few days both podcasts and songs have just been abruptly stopping and the app constantly tells me I'm off line when clearly I have internet access...I've cleared cache as directed, switched phone off, redownloaded the app, all to no avail on my android phone...I'm not quite sure how to proceed but I see others on here with exactly the same problem...please fix!"
The app gets crashing again and again. I uninstalled it and installed it again but of no help. Have reported already quite a few times. I am updating my review to 2 stars. Solve it and update again. Thank you. It's been more than 20 days today. Still no help from Spotify.
"It WAS amazing to listen to but now I have to shut down app, restart my phone everytime i want to continuously listen to music. It only plays maybe 2 songs and stops. Until I open my phone press the next button and then it goes for another 2 songs then stops. It's so flipping annoying!"
"Terrible. First it was good with the playlist but you ruined it. I can't play the songs fully that I want from my play lists! I will no longer use Spotify. Here is the review ""🖕"""
"last update changed the app, it's no longer playing the music continually and requires constant restart of the playlist. Annoying when driving especially you can't skip songs anymore using the car controls or have to manually restart playlist😬 The app is now unusable. In a constant state of downloading and they dont complete. I shouldn't have to keep reinstalling the app for it to work for a day. Definitely leaving as paying for a service I am not happy with!"
"Why is it when I try to add a song to a playlists, the playlists are sorted in a random order? I have my playlists in the main menu sorted in a particular way so it takes half a second to find everything, but when I try to add anything using the Android app instead of desktop, it takes way to long to find anything. It's horrible! What idiot product designer thought that this was a good idea? Give me my playlists in the order I sorted them in."
"The app shows as offline when I join a working wifi. I have to turnoff wifi, close the app and restart it so it recognizes wifi. It behaves the same way when I move from wifi to 4G. It completely ruins the experience, especially as I am paying a family subscription. Both Android and iOS are compromised and behave the same way in several wifi networks."
"Edit: How many more times will I have to uninstall and re-download everything?????? This has been the 4th time. Please FIX this. Painful user experience. Sucks that I can't even use it because it keeps logging me out and I can't log back in, so I have to uninstall and install again, and redownload everything, which is such a waste of time. I paid for premium for a reason. I love Spotify - if only it would work like it's supposed to!"
"Frequent stops, when the phone is locked and then j have to tap the power button just to get it to play again, so when you fix this I'll put a better review up once this is fixed in the next update, bc its hella annoying to have to keep pressing the button just to resume music play"
"Everything is great except you can't shuffle all of your music at once only per a playlist which ruins the whole ""all your music"" experience."
"The app always restarts itself, its been doing it for quiet a while. My playlist cant be played without internet access even tho its downloaded. Im canceling my membership. Disgrace"
"I paid a lot of money and it never works. App needs update everyday. I Have to restart the app every time, and usually requires several restart to finally play some music. Same on PC or phone."
"This app itself is great, I truly appreciate Spotify. But since the last update, music is pausing for no reason, lots of freeze, keeps on bugging. It makes the experience quite unpleasant. As I'm paying for the premium membership, I feel a bit extorted."
Horrible response and hates Discord. Slow and unresponsive. Unfriendly and confusing UI I can't even use it offline. Edit: I'm on premium btw so that really tells something.
"Right now, I'm not too incredibly happy. The app closes by itself after 3-4 songs. I have been a subscriber of Spotify Premium Family for a few years now, and while I love the service, this new bug aggravates me quite a bit. Spotify, please fix this!"
Recently Spotify has been closing randomly mid workout. Being a fitness instructor this is obviously a big problem when with clients. Please fix your app it was fine a few months ago. It's also been messing around with my whole phone when it's in the background and I'm using another app. Quite disappointed.
"The app has become increasingly slow over the past few months. Often, it tells me I am disconnected from network when I am not -- other apps are working, and working quickly. Please fix -- I never leave reviews and have had premium for many years now. It is only now that I am experiencing problems I cannot ignore"
"Awful. One of the worst app i have used. I know they want you to purchase their service but by making free useable you can promise you will not get my business. I hate that daily mixes are shuffle only. That is the only feature i use and you ruined it. I am looking for an alternative to spotify, your service,app, and customer service are sub par."
Im uisng redmi 6 Every time i click on the extra options button in the songs list the whole app freezes and after that song is played it gets stuck in the notification space.......i have to clear all data to use it again and still the problem exist.........
I've never had a problem with Spotify before but for a couple of days I can't stream my favorite music smoothly. Sometimes after play one or two music it'll be stop like I'm not connected to Wi-Fi/Mobile Data or that music will repeat. Last the forward & backward buttons didn't work. Please fix it!
Nothing compliments music quite like having the song you're listening to stop and start repeatedly. Please /please/ fix the issues - it's been months.
Spotify went from being a reasonably good music streaming service to one of the worst out there. The app has become entirely unsuited for listening while on the move.
"Used to be the best in the game, slowly it has become more and more filled with crippling glitches and the recent UI change harmed ease of use pretty severely. Currently shopping alternatives."
"Horrible UI- IF you log off on your phone and try to log back in, you are prohibited from logging in with an error.. you are not connected. DUH!.. My phone is connected, I can log into the web based UI just fine. Pandora is a much better user experience."
Had it for 2 years and have now been kicked out. It wont take my pass word or user name. It sends me a link to allow for me to get back in but when i go to use it 5 seconds after I get it it tells me that the link has expired. Spent 2 years building play lists and have now lost the lot. Going back to my Apple Music list.
"Was good, now it's garbage! Why in the new update would you force portrait view, Its my choice to choose which orientation I use my device and I don't need you to force me to portrait view without being able to change it! ......dumbasses.And why now in my saved albums are there all random tracks inserted that I didn't put there, and then you only allow shuffle play of an album, this is not what the artist made their album for . You have ruined artist's work and ruined what was a pretty good ap"
"Constantly crashes on my phones. If i pause it to check another app or quickly watch a FB video it will restart the song when i go back in to resume it. The changes to the library interface are horrendous compared to other options. Having to follow an artist and like the songs just so the show up in the library. Just runs very poorly, wont be renewing premium that's for damn sure as ive seen forums full of peope complaining of similar issues while you give no feedback or no effort to correct it."
App is terrible. Features keep getting removed (offline mode shortcut). App lags when closing it and music keeps playing. Quite slow changing music.
For the last week spotify has been just randomly pausing and not playing music so I have to restart my songs over and over and its quite annoying and I've tried the methods they gave me to fix it and it doesn't work I'm about to switch back to YouTube red.
"Changes to simplify the app are choking out functionality. You can't choose to stream high quality on WiFi and low quality on data anymore, it's only one option. Also Performing timely actions now require way more button presses than the used to, such as find in playlist or press and hold on a song"
Terrible connection problems with Amazon. Loses ability to play through Echo devices. I have a full paid plan and it's becoming useless quickly. Please fix your integration.
Music will randomly stop playing by itself. You have to press the play button 2 times to make the music start again and when it does its half way through the song.
"Worst music player ever. What's wrong with this app? Terrible UI, randomly add songs to my playlist,... It just drive me crazy. All I ask for is a very simple music player like create playlist, STICK TO SONGS ON THAT PLAYLIST ONLY, repeat playlist, shuffle it and voilà, everything will be smooth as hell. Only reason I install is because of my favorite singer but cant stand the this stupid app."
"Last few months have been awful with spotify. Constantly freezing, playlists and albums failing to load even though they are downloaded. Music just stops playing, even download tracks. The latest updates have made the user experience awkward and navigation difficult. Have reinstalled, have reset all data, have even upgraded to a new handset. I use spotify a lot, but lately it's becoming unusable. Unreliable and frustrating, so disappointing."
"Broken in latest few releases. Don't use, the new tech lead is an idiot. The ui is too bloated. The app doesn't play songs unless you're on the full album. You can't deselect songs you don't like anymore, so you have to manually skip skippables. You have to press a song 5 / 6 times for it to play at times because the event won't fire. Despite all the subscription money they get, they won't invest in more AWS space so you're capped on albums, which is never advertised. Wasn't like this before."
"In India, Spotify doesn't have enough international content to justify as a music app. They have just purchased content rights for a few top songs from each album for english songs. Also, technologically the app is quite archaic. Spotify should learn a thing or two from Google music, YouTube or Amazon music on how the song recommendation or search works."
Your updates have become increasingly bothersome. You started with removing the thumbs up/down button (on radios) and then introduced (a sometimes appearing) heart and stop-sign. Later you added that to save it directly to your library. All of which are bad choices in my experience. Why can I not choose (some of these) the functionality myself? Then now you've changed the library; the artists' page is horribly unordered and if you don't follow them: you're f'ed. Why can I not decide this myself?
"I hope u can take a look at this, my phone is a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro and it runs on MIUI 10,, whenever I try to open the grid at the right side of the song, the app just freezes and crashes. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it still freezes and crashes when I go for the grid button. I never encountered this problem on my previous phone as I am a premium subscriber for 2 years in a row nowm Im going to give it a much better rating if u get to fix this problem but for now its 1"
"Congratulations on ruining the experience for anyone who can't afford a monthly premium signature. Great job. Now I can't even listen to a song that I want without being forced to listen to a random mix of ""mandatory recommended"" other songs first. Also, three ads in a row? Seriously? What's wrong with you people? Isn't all the money you make from subscribers enough?"
"Crashes and deletes all songs randomly. Constantly have ""you are offline"" when I'm trying to login. How do I go online if i can't even login into the app to press that button."
"For God's sake, this app won't stop playing! Give the app a stop button. It starts playing immediately when it connects to my car. This is so bloody annoying I'm just an inch from deleting it and unsubscribing completely. Stupid"
"I really enjoyed spotify initially, ads generally weren't too overbearing, plus every now and then it gives you the 30 mins with no ads. Then my spotify info got stolen by someone in Brazil and now my recommended playlists are all messed up. No way to remove recently played anymore so I guess I just have to re-search for what I like and rebuild my spotify experience all over again."
App keeps going downhill especially after the last UI change? but the last couple weeks most the time it won't or takes a long time to load or play even on Wifi.
"Wouldn't play one of my hits. One time I was trying to play one of my favorite songs, and they took it to another song. Spotify music needs to get it together before the end of time or I'M SUING this app."
"Disappointing and Unnecessary change to UI. User Interface used to be absolutely ideal, now I can no longer easily access my music and favourite playlists. So annoyed that this was done without consent too. Classic example of meddling with something that didn't need fixing. PLEASE GIVE US THE OLD UI"
"This app is way too annoying to use. I subscribed so that I can download my favourite songs. But my downloads keeps on resetting again and again as soon as I close the app. So, I have to download my playlists each time I open. And even though I have downloaded (at least that's what the app shows) it requires internet connection to play the songs. I mean, if that's how it's going to be then why demand subscription fees and fool customers, just keep it simple music streaming app."
"Ads, ads, and more ads every 5-6 minutes. it's Spotify ads and third-party ads. I will not pay you a single cent and will not try premium just because of that. I will just uninstall you and find a better music solution. The design is really awkward, too dark, inconvenient, annoying, and it's really uncomfortable and inconsistent when using it in Android Auto (why not all play lists and options are available in Android Auto?). I recommend to not use this app,there are better, e.g. SoundCloud."
"Playback issue during last 2 months (music stops for 5-10 sec). Known issue but spotify guys can't fix it for so long, it's a shame. UI getting worse and worse with every update... I use premium family and thinking about switching to something else, doesn't worth the price anymore :("
Requires premium to use. Basic features are locked making it hard to navigate and sinply play a song. Youtube music is better! Now lets see what youre gonna do with competition Get youtube music guys.
Lately I can't share any song to social medias. Everytime I tap the menu button the app freezes. Apparently this problem not only happens to me but to some other people as well. I've been using Spotify Premium for years now. Please fix.
"Been using Spotify premium for years, but I REALLY dislike the latest update to the app. Frankly, it's awful. The icons are huge, the text is huge... The play button is now twice the diameter of my thumb. What's that about?! Roll it back, please!! Like yesterday. 😡."
"No idea why I'm paying for this anymore. Stops half way through all the time, freezes completely for a minute or so before finally continuing to play the music. It's been over a month now since this started (on the latest update) and still not fixed."
"nice, but still can't share to the insta story, and some other feature isn't working, even when I already paid for the premium feature. Also somehow it stopped when I played a song, and can be resume as I'm pressing or touching any button. Please kindly fix it. Thanks"
"The app won't let me search any specific song or playlist saying ""no internet connection available"" even though I'm able to play any random song from the current playlist or my daily mixes. All the other apps requiring internet are running smoothly but Spotify can't search a song or playlist."
"Issues I've run into this past week that weren't present before: when listening on my phone/aux, Spotify will not save Gapless play setting & keep abruptly stopping after every song & before commericials. Even with Gapless play adjusted this still occurs while driving which is annoying & unsafe to have to reopen my phone just to get it to play seamlessly. Please fix, thanks."
"Way too many ads. I swear 10 minutes of music and theres 3 god damn ads. I'm also getting tired of the ""watch this short video"" ad where i have to manually click on it to get 30 min of ad free music. When im biking home the last thing i wanna do is stop my bike, take my phone out just to press a button, its getting very tedious. I know they need to put ads to make money but this is too much and im sure it's turning other people away from using this app as well."
"Horrible experience even though I'm a premium user. Switched from apple music to this app, and now regret it. Music stutters and lags while the screen is locked, doesn't matter if the connection is 4G or WiFi. No one wants the song to stutter endlessly while listening to a guitar solo. I looked up this problem and it seems like a common issue, but the developers don't care because it's an Android phone problem. Absolutely disgusting."
"The ads are obnoxious, and even when I have a playlist with hundreds of songs and I select shuffle play, it always plays them in the exact same order. These sorts of tactics are designed to make you want to get premium, and for some people I guess it works, but for me it just makes me hate the entire service and convinces me even more not to waste my money on a business with such obnoxious practices."
"This app works great just enough to lure you in until it becomes basically useless unless you pay to go premium. Mind you, in their opinion the simple choosing of a song you put in the playlist which you created while in the 'trial' period is a premium feature. You enjoy the playlist you made, but only on shuffle, and don't think about adding another song, that's also premium along with every other basic you can think of such as skipping through it. App equivalent of capitalism. Despicable."
"The entire experience was like club penguin island.Basically begging me every 5 seconds saying if I want premium...no well then add every 20 seconds for youuuuu! Also why the ""and we added"" bit like boy if I wanted a song I would have put it on myself also I would like it if mabey we could delete said song if we dont want them instead of hiding them and basically nothing happening to them. Please could you address these issues. Thank you"
"You guys obviously care very little about your customers. Several updates later the app still logs you out randomly, then when you attempt ro log back in, it flashes quickly (like its about to log in) then takes you back to the home screen. Guess I have to uninstall"
The option button isn't working at all. The app crashes everytime I click on the option button. Please fix the bugs. I love Spotify. It's the best.
"Ur update is trash. You absolutely ruined your app. You think I'm gonna pay yo use a skip button to use a music app??? WHAT DA HECC. And plus, I cant even pick a song I want to listen to bc you added ""extra songs"" ur absolute smelly hot trash"
"At first the App worked wonderful, now it shuffles my music an plays 3 songs then quits . I have to open it repeatedly to keep music going . The BS adds are very annoying too ...."
"Way too long loading times on downloaded music. I wonder what the app is actually doing there. Also, sometimes the app won't respond for like 30 seconds, like when you click at a song, it just won't start playing, same goes for pause button."
"At first before I updated the app, I was able to share music without SOUNDS on Facebook stories. So I updated the app thinking it may just be because my app is not up to date. But then now when I tap the share button there is no choice for Facebook to share onto the music you want to share!? What the hell happened Spotify!?"
I just want to listen to one or two songs but whenever i click on a song i get less than 10 seconds of it and then it turns of and i have to press the shuffle plsylist button until i get the song and even if i listen to an album it still adds songs
"I'm sorry, I'm using spotify for many years and I pay for the Premium service. This new version keeps crushing! It crashes every time I press the menu button when a song is playing (both in the playlists song list and inside the playing track). Please solve this problem soon, cause like this I can't do many important things, such as adding the song to one playlist (Redmi Note 8 Pro)"
"The new update is absolute trash. I can no longer look at my songs?!? or shuffle all my songs..... also can't see my most recent downloads when sorting by ""songs"" I loved Spotify before the new ui update but it seriously seriously makes me start looking at Apple or Googles options.... Still sucks 😞"
"I hate every single aspect of the update to the UI of the app and have begun looking for an alternative option to Spotify because of it. Please revert to the old UI of the app and make updates that actually enhance experience and not ones that diminish users ability to play the music they want hear. Update - still extremely dissatisfied with this app, if anyone has any suggestions on alternatives to Spotify please let me know!"
"Unstable and extremely slow application. Tried using the same on both IOS and Android platforms. Many times the application does not respond. You hit play and you can hear the song playing after 5 to 10 mins. Even after you have completely downloaded all the songs in the playlist, be prepared to see the downloads disappear after a couple of days, and u download them again. Spotify... do you even invest any amount in doing basic QA tests, let alone the poor user experience. A big SHAME SPOTIFY..."
Buggy. Music always stop when u idle ur phone. Have to keep on pressing a button in my phone just to resume. Been a premium user for years but this update just sucks. Please fix it.
Can you please allow me to remove a song from the Playlist it is CURRENTLY playing in with the 3-dot menu on the now-playing page? Edit: 10/22/19 podcasts broken since new UI implementation.
"Ive had spotify for years now never had an issue with it. However, with the latest update my music stops playing when my phone is locked. Its an intermittent fault as it doesnt happen every time music plays, but it requires me to reset my phone whenever it does it. Could spotify please look into this issue as it looks like others have it too?"
"At first this app was super helpful and fun, but then I forgot my password and Spotify signed me out, I clicked the button that said send me a link but when I got the link, four hours later, it didn't work, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app but that didn't work either"
"Typically incredibly buggy. Doesn't change songs when i press the button, flips back and forth between songs because the skip track mechanic is glitchy, plays sometimes entire song after the app has frozen"
Worst UI. Just want to listen to some music and end up wasting time trying to figure out how this app work. PC version is way better.
"The app just keeps stopping during playback, especially on my phone (S9) very annoying and not worth the cost of Premium at all unless this problem is fixed quickly."
"This app always has a bug. This time: every single time I press the options button when I'm on a playlist, it closes. Every time I mean it does not miss a beat."
"I hate the ""we added"" and ""extra songs"" section because you cant remove songs from your own playlist and you cant skip them either if spotify is reading this i gave a 1 star because of this thing alone has just ruined the entire experience of making your own playlist and listening to your fav songs because the songs you add are totally irrelevant and pointless. I normally listen to piano music i literally got a rap song in my playlist from we added Please give the option to remove this feature"
"Infrequent but hugely frustrating problem: logs out and doesn't allow to log in because it's ""offline"". The only way to bypass is to uninstall. Which then. Requires re-downloading all the songs, a messy and time consuming affair. Issue exists for years without a fix."
"Dreadful experience. Signed up to premium family for the kids yesterday so installed the app on my phone. Haven't managed to play a single piece of music yet in several attempts since then. I just get a message saying playback disabled, something about browser permissions and a big button telling me to install the app. The app is already installed and the button does nothing. And I'm in a pretty technical job working on similar products so lord help others. Just awful"
"Dear Spotify, your free service on mobile app is unintuitive, has abysmal UI, terrible UX, and is designed only to function as rage inducing unusable annoyment app. Now a user is forced to watch VIDEO commercials, while not allowing to play a song you want or someone has linked. It is literally a junk bloatware on free mode. Here's your review."
When I try to search always shows that I am offline. Other apps which uses internet resources works fine. UPDATE: Most confusing UX I ever used (on any platform)!
Worst experienced. They advertised 3 months free premium subscription but still I was charged when I subcribed. I have inquired from their Admin and said I am NOT eligible for. How would I know this? They didn't include it in their annoying advertisement. Dont fall for this scam folks!
"Royally sucks but does the job for now. Harasses you with ads, both audio and visual. The volume button suddenly has to be tapped repeatedly in order to get to mute, which is obviously designed to stop you easily muting them....especially annoying when cycling as you cannot do that safely. EDIT, Ads are now every few songs and are double the length. And the widget requires the entire app to be reinstalled every week as it randomly goes black & readding it to your home screen wont fix it."
"Spotify logged me out of my account and I tried logging back with the correct information, then it said that my password was incorrect (it's not) then it sent a link, I press the button immediately and Spotify says that the link has expired when I really had 4 hours left. I've tried everything, this goddamn app won't let me back into my account. Plus, it's not letting me delete my account when I'm in it. Absolutely awful. This has been happening for so long and I'm so sick of it."
"awful app TBH. the only good thing about it is the great design. i keep trying to connect my account to facebook, but it always tells me there has been a server error. i. have. tried. everything. this app is a waste of space"
Bad UI - navigation in the app is tedious! Also the app keeps waking the screen on my phone when I'm streaming to other devices using Spotify connect.
If you sign up using mobile phone then you won't be able to add an email id to account as it requires a password which you actually did not set. If you try to reset the password it wont work because you haven't set a recovery email. This is known as a DEADLOCK. And im outta here bye.
"Spotify Premium randomly stop playing music until i unlock the phone or click any button. Disabled: power saving, data saving, put to sleep in background, adguard, everything that was suggested and still same issue. This was not the case before (2Mo ago) but i guess this 'feature' come with some of the app updates. Highly disappointed to pay for premium only to have worst experience then watching youtube ads while playing. I hope this will help catch Spotify attention and finally fix this bug."
"The good: It's free! The bad: Low quality music - no more than 320 kbps. Limited collection of music. Hard to use UI - not intuitive and not understanding user's behaviour. Very intrusive ad - coming between ur songs very frequently, disrupting ur music listening mood. The baseline: Not worthy to pay. Ads make the free version very ""user-hostile"". Uninstalled after few uses."
Calling this free music and podcasts is quite rich. At the moment it plays one or two songs I want to hear then ads followed by a horrific playlist that you have no input over for about 10 minutes. What's the point? If I want to listen to bad music I have no control over I could just turn in heart or a similar station. Where is that uninstall button
"Doesn't work properly in combination with my Spotify enabled HiFi components way too often. I thought these are teething troubles but it just does not come together for years now. Also from a user interface perspective it's a worst practice example (inconsistant behaviour, bad UI layout, etc.) I'm freaking out on a daily basis. Really only using it since there is no real alternative."
This is a horible app so many bugs that can be so fruastrating that i want to pull my hair out i hate it so much i hate this app and the bugs on itmyfavorite song was about come on and itpausedfor some reason so i reloaded the app and playedmy playlist and it went to the next song withoutplaying my favorite song that i really wantedto listen too and ruined my wholeexcersise
"why would you think its ok to move the ""search in playlist"" button?? Not only is the new set up stupid but when you search an artist in your playlist and want to hear only their songs it will play songs from other other artists. whats the point"
Over half the time I close the screen to standby the music stops. Hit the side power button music comes on again. Why is this happening so f@*king often. Any help
"Spotify is a great service but the app is very glitchy. There is no help line or support and the only helpnyou can find on some blogisphere doesn't make it any better. Love spoitfy. Wish they would fix the stopping, rhe pausing, the deleting my stored songs and the overall quirkiness."
Interface changed so artist page no longer has sections for albums and singles. You have to press a 'see discography' button now to find the album you're looking for. There is no setting to keep the discography as the default view. This update was a bad idea. I am a premium user.
"Premium member here: I've used, paid for and loved the app for a long time but the most recent update is so infuriating that I hate every moment I have to use the new UI. I don't even want to open the app anymore. No more library? Why? Why can't you ""play all,"" only songs that you've ""liked"" one by one. If the app isn't made better soon, I will be unsubbing and removing app."
"Please stop removing functionality, this is a five star app and I'll change my review when I can long press to open up the menu on a song again and I can more quickly search songs in a playlist by swiping down, I don't understand why such useful features keep being removed"
"It used to be good, but now it just a confusing mess. Like who designed this UI?? Can't even access the songs fully can only hear preview smh."
"The newest update has ruined my mobile experience. It just freezes after 10 minutes and I have to restart the app and restart my music. When I'm studying, it's extremely distracting to do it as I'm trying to focus and just use music to help."
"I used to have over 8000 songs in my library. I didn't ""heart"" every single one so I have no way of listening to them all on shuffle now. If I'm having to build my music list back up from scratch I'll be doing it on another service."
"This app is now complete garbage, it will pause streaming for no reason,whether or not I am on wifi, I have to hit play button to get it to start again, if it happens during a song the song starts over, if its during a podcast it will resume either 5 to 10 minutes ahead or 5 to 10 minutes behind where I am actually at, I am done I drive for a living and this is maddening."
"Fix your booboo Spotify!! I'm a loyal customer too. But it's slowly wearing out. because of the continuous crashing every 5 or 10 minutes whilest I have this playing in the backround. I'm paying 15bux a month on this, last thing I want is to have my music vibes butted in over a crashed app grrr. You will get all starts when you fix the crash problems"
"Too damn difficult to use. I came to you because I can't find some songs from Amazon prime music but your UI is absolute shlt tiers. Is this the reason why you give 3 months subscription service for free? Too shltty that you need at least 3 months to fix this? I even did subscribe to your ""premium"" service and can't find button that is available for me. I check the tutorial from YouTube and it seems bunch of buttons are missing from my app. Don't be Microsoft with their win10 updates."
"new update ruined the app for me With the new update, now I cant listen to music while my screen locks. I have to make sure the screen is always on, or the song will pause."
"Some of the worst music apps I ever paid for! On the Samsung S9 the music stops randomly all the time, when you're not activly using your phone. Its so unreal anoying in the car or while doing sports that I will quit my subscription as fast as possible. I'm so pissed that a paid service works so bad, I wish I would have never paid for it. Save your money guys, this is trash..."
"Keeps crashing and not functioning properly. I'm the middle of playing songs it just stops and crashes. Scroll down function doesn't work properly either, 9 times out of 10 it doesn't let me like or dislike songs. I have to maybe press the heart button 20 times until it presses. Please fix this problem or have a section in customer support for the app itself. Thank you"
"I loved spotify until now. It keeps on crashing on me, pausing music out of nowhere quite recently. Very disappointed and I hope they fix this soon!"
Stop it with the useless and unnecessary changes to UI (repeat and shuffle button). I liked it when it was easier to find what you needed the app to do in only a few screens. Will have to rollback the app and redownload my music library.
"I really like Spotify, but your Android app just turned so much worse with the latest update(s). After studying it for quite a long time now, I still do not understand how the new artist page in the library is sorted. It's neither by alphabet, popularity nor by my most recent plays... The title page is missing completely. Therefore it is really hard to quickly get to the music I want, especially in offline mode, where the pages load ridiciously slow."
"use to love this app a lot until the newest update. ever since it updated it wont let me play some songs on my playlist. when i click on a song it shows what song is being played, but its not being played. even though i have undownloaded and redownloaded my playlist multiple times it still doesnt work. i have been a spotify premium user for quite a few years now, but im now considering either cancelling my subscription or just deleting the app off my phone."
"New update is ruining it. Bugs where bad, bugs are better now. But the way its styled is very hard for me to find new music and listen to my favorite albums. Also the way albums and singles are located now is trash, these arent updates, your just rearranging things in a trash way"
"Lately spotify has been an absolute joke, it's used 18gb of mobile data to keep downloading the same albums everytime I have accessed my account even though every time I have waited for it to finish downloading before i closed the app. But guaranteed the next day when I opened it back up I had to download everything again. I pay each month for the premium and yet this is how spotify is acting. I'm going to cancel my premium spotify if it keeps continuing and going to go to soundcloud."
"Spotify used to be brilliant up until the SLEEP TIMER feature, you have added minutes increments but where is the option to turn SLEEP TIMER Off ? . Thankyou for ruining what was a brilliant app"
The latest update runis what used to be a 9/10 app. It is now unbelievably slow (on a OnePlus 6) even after a complete reinstall. It takes several seconds to load an album even if is saved to my phone. The new UI is also to my mind far less efficient. But hey I now see an advert for the new Lion King album thay I dont want to listen to every time I open the app thay I cannot hide.
"The most recent update has ruined the app, I was trying to create a new playlist, but making me go through adding songs one by one instead of album by album. So stupid"
"Dear Spotify Devs, Stop changing how things look and where they are. It's beginning to get really frustrating. I understand a fresh new look but putting the save to my library button in the top corner instead? It was better when it was located under the album art."
Got stabbed in a back.Recently downgraded to spotify free because I decided to save up for a bit and the free spotify now only has a SHUFFLE FUNCTION??? what??? I cant even listen to the song I want because of the limited skip button.. Company clearly does not care about it's customers. Might just uninstall :)))
"This app is absolute garbage, I don't understand how you screwed up this bad, beings on PlayStation and PC it is actually very good. Your other two platforms take away any excuse you have for this one being so God awful. Someone in your Spotify crew that coded and designed this thing needs to be fired, because as far as it goes for the tablet/phone, I won't be using it. P.S. the one star is only there because I couldn't give you a zero."
"Since the latest update I can't get rid of the notification even if I quit the app, and sometimes it'll pause my song by itself. Usually a great app, needs fixing"
"Perfect until widget was removed. Don't try to dumb down the user experience to iOS level. If I wanted to go through apps to open this every time I would just get an iPhone.-------------- Update 9/25: the songs will now randomly stop, so I have to reopen the app to get music started again. Fix your app please!"
Why in the world does this app require you to use a paysafecard? If you don't have a card that can be used for a auto pay subscription then you have to find one of the 3 paysafecard retailers in your entire state. Then drive and purchase said care because purchasing one online is to convenient. Other than that it's great but still trash.
This app is TRASH. When I listen on my phone the music is constantly stopping and only starts when I press the home screen button or unlock my phone. Even when I have wifi and the songs are downloaded they still stop. I don't pay for this service only to have it not work as intended. Fix your app.
"Unable to Chromecast from my phone to my smart tv here & there, which is quite annoying! Therefore, I end up having to uninstall & reinstall Spotify :-("
"the latest update has ruined Spotify for me. Its changed the UX interface to be much more inconvenient & as others have already mentioned my songs either wont load ""opps, there seems to be a problem"" at almost every search plus songs will almost always hit the 3 sec mark then freeze and then once they finally get going they randomly freeze throughout. grrrrrrrrr."
"it won't work for me! i had to reset my password three times and it would not recognize my account no matter how much i double checked my spelling and there were no errors. mistake on the app's side. not even the technician i was talking to could help fix the issue, we tried literally everything. my disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined."
"Every new update completely changes the UI which makes the app unusable. Besides the order of playlists are unpredictable when adding a song to a playlist, it is not possible to play all downloaded songs; there is no option for streaming over Wi-Fi only; it is impossible to play multiple Playlists;"
"Whatever moron designed the ""block song"" button that also immediately skips the song and makes it unfindable and put it right beside the like button needs to be sacked immediately. Disaster. Anyone with half a brain wouldn't put the button that saves a song you like beside the one that makes it practically impossible to find again. Pathetic design ."
"*update* the filter downloaded songs fuction in the playlists seem to stop filtering them when you suffle the music in that playlist. Please fix this i want to save my data. * The ui change has made the listening to songs much harder. where the all somgs section works by allowing someone to listen to music from all their choices, the new system makes it hardier to add songs to listen too."
"New Spotify sucks! There is no button to listen to your library, you can only access playlist. Where are all my songs!"
"having a really bad experience with your app. lags most of the time (especially when changing the track), which completely ruins the mood.Not the app that could be recomended to anyone."
"Terrible user experience. Now playing screen will not go to landscape mode, which is both frustrating and frankly dangerous while driving. There is a car mode which is worse than useless; no access to library, so playing an album for example is impossible."
Shuffle is horrible. And for Andriod users you have you no longer can just go to the top of your playlist and search a song you now have to press settings button and find search song. Very annoying. But yet iphone users have that option.
Why can't I just start and listen to my Playlist from the beginning to the end I need that dhit to be on shuffle all the time. It was better before the update and now its ruined. I'm disappointed with that change
"One of the worse music search app I've ever used, at first it was going quite ok but then after coming back from work and the whole damn song just shuffle play itself whenever i choose to play my favorite song and sometimes it won't even play (the app wants me to buy the premium if i wish to continue)."
I was a way for awhile.......I dont know what the heck happened but it's terrible now. Not intuitive and does a terrible job of organizing your music. It's a big mess. Take notes from google play and apple music spotify. I'm cancelling and going back to google play. When I go into offline mode it should only show artists and albums I have downloaded not my entire library.
"Spotify I have an idea for you if your going to keep pushing these terrible updates... Provide like an optional developers mode, where if people want to they can customise their own UI, like most aftermarket media library programs (musicbee for example). And then we can finally have artists in alphabetical order !"
It used to be great. But lately it slow and almost not working. Painfully slow! Been a premium subscriber for years. Better fix it quick or I'm leaving.
Can't turn off app. You listen to music for a while. There is NO STOP button... Not even in settings. Runs in background
"When I couldn't play the songs I like without the interruption of other songs added by sportify to my list and being unable to click the next button when using the free zone, I knew the app wasn't meant for me. I will gently face YouTube that I have been enjoying music from and quietly delete this sportify app occupying precious space on my phone."
"Absolutely unusable. App freezes and requires restart after every single ad break. Not everyone wishes to pay for premium, but it should not break the app."
Same problems as everyone else. This has been happening since June 2019 and the updates dont fix it. Time for me to end my subscription and stop paying for junk. Just not a responsive app. Songs will pause for no reason or the app just stops. Other times when i press stop or even if i force quit out of the app the music will keep playing for a minute or two
"already ruined UI with june update, i dont care about podcasts, stop shoving them down my throat. and now my playlists randomly revert to versions from a few months ago, removing and adding songs, then they change back to the recent version, but this cannot be controlled, and every time it has to redownload songs. kinda annoying, think its time to ditch spotify."
"My songs are constantly stopping randomly and will not continue playing. My phone screen is unlocked when this happens so it is not being timed out. In the app the 'pause' button is present, meaning the song is supposed to be playing, yet nothing is heard and the loading bar for the song is not moving. This needs to be fixed!!! It is especially annoying when I have it set up while driving and then have to continue driving without being able to fix it, i.e. driving in silence!!"
"randomly pauses songs when screen goes to sleep and won't continue to play until a button is pressed to wake the screen up EDIT: this issue WAS fixed, but with the most recent update, it appears to have started again"
Terrible UI. Go back to the old UI from before the summer where there was an actual songs library instead of just liked songs.
Bring back shuffling filtered searches in playlists. I wanna shuffle certain artist's song in a playlist. and why isnt the filter search bar always visible now?? Sorting the playlist is broken now. Sorting by artist just jumbles up their songs rather than the old way of ordering their albums by name while sorting the artist. Another reason why these updates are ruining the app.
"This app used to be ok. But now it sucks!!! Playback just stops when your phone screen timeout!! Looking at others' feedback, apparently I am not the only one who is suffering this. But Spotify just keeps quiet?"
It drains all power from other apps you may have on your phone. I almost wasted money on a new phone until I realised it was spotify ruining it. Do not download!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The mystifying ""playing from play que"" makes this app unbearable to listen to. The play que is inaccessible. No ui element to get to it anywhere. You could try playing an album, plays one song from it, then it will switch over to some suggested song it's qued up from left field. Infuriating."
"Songs keep stopping during a play intermittedly!! Super irritating coz i have to keep touching a button on the phone to get a song going 😑 and updates of the app doesnt help, please fix this bug!"
this new sootify is terribke for oeiple who have lots of music saved. i like albums and now cant organise the 8800 songs in that playlist in my moto 5g plus. all the albums are stuck in alphabetical order so i cant find the most recently saved ones. this may be an issue with just the filter button on this OS but i also hate the larger icons and 'simplicity' style. save that for the iphone users please
"Okay guys. We figured out the UI, how to interact with it and enjoy using the app. And the new problem is the constant, persistent music stopping randomly. Is there a sleep timer on this guy? Is there a bug? Can you please fix this? It makes using the app very very frustrating. Please Spotify!"
"The basic app performance has gotten much worse. The library takes ages to appear and my music pauses randomly all the time too. The UI is just terrible and I haven’t found a natural way to use it after a couple of months of the new system. The differentiation between artists/albums, the need to ‘follow’ artists, the inconsistency between downloaded/liked. Singles off an album being labelled individually rather than as part of the album. So many niggly bits that make it close to unusable."
Premium user here. Not sure why they've made it so that the only artists I can view in my library are the ones that I'm following. Makes for terrible browsing and provides zero ease of access. This is just one of many unproductive UI updates that Spotify have made to their app. It's getting beyond ridiculous at this point and is practically breaking their app.
"Latest update sucks, even worse than last one. It's never been so slow, offline mode doesn't really work unless I'm on airplane mode, and streaming is constantly interrupted: for some weird reason, whatever I'm listening to suddenly stops, and if I tap the home button on my phone it automatically resumes playing. I've used Spotify for a while now, and I used to never have issues with it, but last two updates have been absolutely terrible. If issues persist, I'l have to migrate to Apple Music."
"The music selection is great, as are the curated playlists. The app, however, has become abysmal. It is often times very slow and crashes. It has limited functionality over before. And many simple functions such as searching require multiple steps."
"Why is it with every update you make the UI more unintuitive? Why was ""Saved songs"" changed to ""Liked songs?"" Why do I have to click the menu button then click search when I could just drag down and search before? What is the point?"
"I guess there is some bug because this app randomly pauses songs whenever I'm listening to songs while the phone is locked, i have touch the screen or use the button on earphone to continue. Worst thing is there is no pattern it just happens randomly, even sometimes it happens twice simultaneously. This is highly frustrating."
Still doesn't update song name on my Lexus IS300h screen via Bluetooth when it switches songs by itself. When I switch manually via buttons on steering wheel - all works. Google Music works fine.
"I can not use the audio control buttons on the lock screen of my Samsung S10+. This app sucks, so I'm using Google Music instead. I have not uninstalled the Spotify app yet, but if this crappy app doesn't improves SOON... is gone for good."
"Technical issues- having many issues, the app closes when I lock my phone screen, the app stops working when I finish watching a video on another app, and the phone doesn't work at times through my headphones. I have reinstalled many times and the issue is still occurring. Please fix this. It's quite frustrating."
"The latest update has ruined my experience with this. They removed the widget, making it frustrating to control my music; songs cut out if my screen locks or goes to sleep and the overall layout is terrible to navigate. I'm seriously considering cancelling my subscription if this isn't fixed."
Updated (Note 9) and now can not even log in. Just kicks one out and crashes. A music app you cant log into to listen to music with is useless. C'mon guys...you're not a 2bit app being built in a basement...very dissapointing...
Updates just make it worse UI updates just make it harder to get to the music you want to hear. Final straw was when they removed the Android widget. Canceled my subscription.
Terrible user experience. I'm ok with ads for free content... even forcing shuffle play. But please stop interrupting playlists or albums with recommended songs!
Spotify decided to automatically expire my password and make it seem like it was Google's smartlock's problem. Caught in crash loop. Complete waste of time. Poor engineering and poor user experience practice.
"Seriously, it seems to happen regularly, been losing my downloaded songs in my fone, probably every day! i have plenty of music like almost 500 songs and i cant play anything offline coz it says downloading 1 of 5555!! And I dont have internet options available in my area thats fast so it takes awhile to redownload my music! seriously fix this. im a premuim subscriber because i thought it can download music and i can listen even if i dont have an internet connection. please fix this!"
Terrible UI. Always drops songs you dont want in your stream. Constantly boots itself in the background and drains your battery. Need I go on?
I had premium for a few years it was a great music app but cancelled after recent updates. I couldn't careless bout podcasts I only want music I couldn't easily download single songs anymore had a stupid heart symbol had a random playlist I couldn't get rid off god knows why they changed it I looked on Spotify forums and their attitude rubbed me up the wrong way I would have no worries paying again if they went back to how it was. Checking out youtube music suits me well so far
"I used to love spotify and listen to it daily, as a premium member. However the recent updates that have removed ""all songs"" from my library has ruined my experience with the app. The suggestion by customer service online is to manually like every song you download (just liking the albums wont work) and then shuffle play the ""liked songs"" playlist. This turns what used to be a user friendly option into a frustrating experience. Unless this ifixed I will be looking into an alternative service."
"So bad Music doesn't stop when WhatsApp call comes, no lock screen/notification bar widget or anything like that. God! now I feel my Google music was so much better and simple. Don't know why my triple tap to go back doesn't work on wired earphones which does on Google btw! I can go on and on about it man! Going back to Google Music. UI is not user friendly either."
Sort it out! No widget and the like button when using my dropdown menu doesn't work. I don't want to go into the app everytime I want to do something. Sort it out. Now using my location to verify my address? Nah.
MOST dumb update ever done in terms of UI. I dont use playlists as much as Spotify wants to think. So now I cant even filter my Artists that I have downloaded. The last UI was fine. Just don't remove stuff that users actually use. It is now a hassle and not very easy to use in terms of even finding a certain artist you do have offline without now typing their name anyways. I hate using the app
Been using for years...was perfect....now on my SAMSUNG S10+ IT LAGS SO MUCH!! The lag is ruining my view of spotify please fix this asap...i think its a phone specific issue!!
"1. App design is trash (on all platforms) 2. They ignore user requests/feedback. 3. All music is equally available on Google or Apple Music. 4. Family plan is limited to those who ""live together"". Conclusion: pick anything else but Spotify."
since it been updated. it won't work. it quits playing or randomly kicks me out. happens after every update. started to think it's not worth it!
"While connected to Bluetooth, music stops when my phone is locked. Will start playing music when I unlock phone for small amount of time. Edit* Now it doesn't even have to be connected to Bluetooth. It just stops playing songs and will only start again when you press the sleep button on the phone(only for 5 to 10 seconds of playtime). Edit* still happening. Have done the recommended uninstall and reinstall but the issues still persists. Also the new artist system is terrible."
"The free version is pointless. I click a link to listen one particular song and pressing the ""shuffle play"" (the only button available) starts an another, completely random song. Another click gives another random song, NO way to listen the one I want. I know you're forcing everyone to buy premium, but this is way too much. You won't get my money with such attitude!"
"UI is bad. 'All songs' functionality is ruined and youre forced to 'like' every song in order to have a shuffle all ability. I make my own playlists, why would I want one of EVERY song Ive clicked like on? Questioning why I even pay to use this anymore"
"Why does spotify only some of the 1000+ songs when I want all the songs to play continuously, not start the queue list again after a handful songs? The shuffle nor repeat are on so all the songs should play! Why do you keep ruining this app?"
I loved this app premium for years untill last couple updates..is constanly lagging ..the ui isnt good saved songs make you follow to add to collection .when you try to see artist of downloaded songs dont work ..nothing is in alphabetical order anymore ..its ridiculous ..i pay to download and no ads but its impossible to enjoy it easily ..whem you have 10000 songs down loadef and have to follow and search un alphabetical..tge old way was so much better..its like pandora now and pandora sucks
"Some things like removing a song from your queue are a hassle and not intuitive at all. The sleeptimer should be a lot more visible with a countdown. Biggest minus is the lack of a widget! What music player has no widget in this day and age, ridiculous! Especially since this is a service I'm paying for!"
It's slow to react. Plays different music without my permission. Not too functional either. Weak sound quality is another worry. Looks like the app has been written by someone in a huge hurry. From 3 stars to one - well deserved!I'll keep using it until I find a suitable app that's not interfering with my choice. Stop choosing for me for God's sake!
Since the new update the app keeps crashing and stops playing the music until you press a button on your phone. Fix this please. It's frustrating listining to music like this!
"I used to use spotify alot and thought it was cool, you could stream music, make multiple playlists and listen to your favourite songs. But now its just trash. I cant even make a playlist without some automated idiot adding songs that I ""might like"" (that I don't) to my playlists. And there's no way to actually choose the song that you want to listen to without having premium, all you can do is press the shuffle button and hope that the song you want starts playing and not the ones they added."
"I have used Spotify for years and I was quite happy with it. However, they recently removed their widget for Android. This was frustrating but not a deal breaker for me. However, they have been unresponsive to customer complaints about the removal of the widget and haven't even given a real response as to why it happened and why it's not coming back. This is unacceptable to me, so I have stopped my premium account and am now looking at other services."
This bug where you put it on offline and suddenly logs you out of spotify. And can't do anything about it pisses me off. I lost quite a few downloaded albums because it keeps happening. Tss please fix this
This app used to be great! And I never had any problems with it. But now its almost impossible to use. The new updates are not user friendly at all. They make things more complicated. I hate that they got rid of the widget. I have to click more buttons to get the app open. The app is also supper buggy now. It keeps pausing when i put my phone on idle. It also crashes aot while im using my phone. I am seriously considering unsubscribing!
"Bring back the widget! I complained by email about the widget being removed and received a reply that it was so that ""users won't be confused with the playback notification on Android, that also shows what is playing (album art), play/pause button, and skip forward and backwards"" What a load of rubbish. If they think so little of their customers, I'll cancel my subscription and go elsewhere."
"The ""Shuffle Play"" update has made Spotify complete garbage, I no longer can listen to songs I like, I have to listen to ""similar"" songs, thanks a lot Spotify, you have really ruined my listening experience."
Not sure what has happened. Suddenly spotify widget is missing and no longer can be found. its a pain when im driving to have to keep hitting the app button vs widget
The new update is very inconvenient and makes it annoying to use the app. Recently played songs are not where they were before and songs are required to get liked one by one. Saving or even downloading an album will not automatically like the songs in said album. This makes it an overall messy update that no one asked for.
"Bring back the android widget. That is all. The widget was on the home screen of my phone and was used 100s of times a day. The system tray ""replacement"" is total rubbish as it times out when music is paused, so not even close to a suitable alternative."
The Your Library update that doesn't let you see an alphabetically organized list of artists you have in your library but instead only allows you to see a list of recently played artists or followed artists has thoroughly RUINED the spotify experience. Way to blow it for no reason.
"(I'm afraid if you guys keeps randomly removing good features like this, I won't get that subscription no more) U lot makes me scratch my head when comes to design decisions | 1 Removed now playing screen rotate | 2 No more track selection, forced Premium | 3 Removed widget (Its a feature that wont bog the user at all, if they don't like it, they won't put the widget at all, but it still exist) Simple yet weird decisions that arent necessary. You guys sure hired the right person for the job?"
Constantly pausing songs no matter what the support tell you to do. Great collection of music shame you cant listen to a full song before it stops playing. Apparently this is a problem spotify has been having since 2011. So they really are quick to try and solve the problems for the customers.
Great music service but they ruined it when they got rid of the widget. It made listening very easy and convenient. No good reason to get rid of it.
Edit: Pauses music everytime i lock or unlock my phone and press the home button. App went from great to trash in one update. randomly chose to remove widget which i use all the time while bike commuting. Now i have to try to manuver multiple gestures while biking in traffic. not only is this a negative quality of life change but it also makes it unsafe for me to even try to use spotify as my music choice now.
"Lately very glitchy: I cant use the ""I don't like this song"" button when I'm not inside the app, the app always crashes, the android widget is gone - fix ur problems!!! It used to be so much better"
"Removing quality of life functionality like the widget (canceled sub over this) and ruining the library & Favorites integration, which makes the whole experience cumbersome and a hassle to deal with.. Seriously, whomever the heads of development and PR are over there.. need to be dragged out to the street and stoned. They clearly got too big for their britches, and forgot about those who made all this success possible in the first place. The consumers. Whom you all clearly now disregard."
"Premium user here, and with recent update I lost the option to use my stereos skip track, paise, and play buttons on Bluetooth. It worked just fine wih the previous version of spotify."
"I love Spotify, but for some reason it wont play the music loud. I've gone through all my settings and it's set to loud but each song starts loud then goes quiet and I can hardly hear it. Yet go onto facebook and my ears get blown of from one video. 😓 not happy and I pay for premium. Why does this happen i have to put my stereo and earphones everything on full ball and you can still only just hear it. Cant enjoy the music anymore"
only interested and pays attention to you if you pay for premium which by the way is more expensive than most other media apps which require a subscription and at least those apps tv shows films and other stuff so to the makers of this app you just do music! you don't need to charge 10.99 a month for bloody music!
When I click dismiss button to remove add on my screen. It doesn't give me any effect and it still appears on screen. No reaction. All I have to do is relaunch the app. Untill I relaunch it....the add never disappeares. I need to do it everytime when it appears. Disappointed😐
"Wouldn't let me log into my old account , so I had to create a new one. That account gave me a random name, which can't be changed and won't let me unlink my facebook so I can create a new account. Constantly plays pop music that I didn't choose to add. Overall p.o.s software designed to make everything difficult."
"After the recent updates, it's been getting worse and worse, and with the removal of the Android Widget, it's purpose just dropped. Most people use the widget to quickly change, repeat, play and pause songs. #bringthewidgetback"
"With the latest update, I can no longer like or dislike tracks from the notification and lockscreen, which makes my ""Discover Weekly"" a nuisance to listen to."
"Flermed the downloaded song search, made it ridiculously hard to search the music of a given artist, borked the offline mode, made weird UI changes, got rid of the playlist filter bar, removed the artists section, removed the alphabetical scrollbar, and removed the recently-played section...  ...And now they've gone and scrubbed the widget!     ""Why?"", you ask?     ""Improvement"", apparently - though nobody has really figured out what the improvements are yet.     I'm seriously considering using another service... one that doesn't remove *utterly basic features*...... the only thing they have going for them is the extensive library of songs - which are getting increasingly harder to search through thanks to their ""improvements"""
"Widget was removed in this update. Notification is not an appropriate replacement because it disappears and requires an extra tap to access from the home screen. Awful, awful update. :( Bring back the widget!"
"Why did you have to remove the widget, seriously?! Why do I have to scroll through the drop down menu or navigate my home screen, this is super unpractical, especially when it comes to starting the app, I now have to actually tap on it, instead of just pressing the play button. It takes me now about 5 taps to skip a song what before the update took me only 1."
"This new update ruins it completely, the removal of ""songs"" tab, in a music app? Not smart and now you cant see all of your songs at all. Removed the widget support, why remove a feature that did nothing but make it easy to use. This is dissapointing"
"The audio quality is sometimes less than what can be found for the same song on SoundCloud even with max settings. And the latest UI changes are very inconvenient for me to use. Since recent updates, the app frequently struggles to load or play."
"EDIT: LATEST VERSION 8.5.18.934 STILL DOES NOT HAVE ARTISTS SORTED ALPHABETICALLY OR HAVE THE ALPHABET SCROLLBAR + BUT IT HAS THE ""FOLLOW"" BUTTON FUNCTION. 🙄🙄🙄 DON'T BOTHER UPDATING THE APP, STILL A WASTE OF TIME. Whatever this current version is.. Absolutely STINKS!!! My main complaints is the new version is extremely slow and lags and they removed the alpabeticized scrollbar and lastly they added this stupid ""follow"" button in the artists section and leaving the list sorted randomly.."
"You've removed the widget, how stupid. I can use the built in android functions however i cant go back on a track, only forward, I have tried multiple bluetooth devices to no avail, i have also tried amazon music and the track changing is fine, 100% spotify issue that i never had with the widget. i could also change tracks from my homescreen rather than the pulldown android menu that i dont use and doesn't always show my music apps that are currently playing. Why change something that works?"
This used to be my favorite music app. App in general. But this snow layout and updates have been awful. And now I my spotify widget is gone and isn't available so I have to open the app every time or pull down the notification bar to skip or interact with the app. WTH are you guys doing? You're ruining the app and this is coming from someone who's paying for premium and considering trying something else and cancelling my account with you guys.
Songs keep stopping. Songs then go back to beginning or back a minute or two. It has been quite frustrating considering I pay montly for this app.
"used to be my daily driver for podcasts because the widget made it easy AND SAFE to use while driving. now the UX is essentially ""dont open this since we will bombard you with 'announcements' (ads)"". thanks for making me 100% google play music now."
got rid of the homescree widget because even thwir design/developer team doesnt understand the difference/failings of the notification controls. not that they care this move is designed to push users to open the app more often which goes right along with their move to start pushing ads to paying users ( people who literally pay to avoid ads!!) but they call them announcements so its ok... switching to google play music or tidal.
"After many years of using Spotify they seem to be making it less and less user friendly. They recently removed the widgit for the home screen, which was incredibly useful always took center of my screen. But for some reason they removed this feature. Seriously considering cancelling my premuim after 5 years of service."
"Great music quality and music taste algorithms, But recently the UI became worse and the widget has been removed. No idea why the developers are ruining it, I've rollbacked to 8.5.2.759"
"Since removal of the home widget we've lost a fairly convenient functionality of this app. Spotify believe the bar in the notification section is suitable, however I disagree."
Has one of the worst UIs and is extremely buggy. The only thing worse than this app is the Spotify app for my watch. They also removed the home screen widget.
"Removing a perfectly good function for no good reason is stupid. Used the widget daily.. App update has ruined the app for me, more disorganized. Spotify, you don't have to change things for the sake of changing them! Unsubscribed and deleted app. Hope your update was worth it."
"With every single update something new is being broken or the same broken thing will still be broken but in a new way. Last time volume buttons next/prev track were completely broken. Now, the volume buttons either skip forward for like 20 sec or bckwards, instead of next/prev track. Oh, and the music randomly stops just because... Im gonna give iTunes a try, it's been an awful ride, Spotify."
"Sudden removal of widgets (key feature for Android users) without a proper alternative is a big disservice. The app UI is clunky and not user friendly. Otherwise the selection/quality of music itself is really good. If they bring the widgets back, its a solid 4-5 star app. (i am a premium user)"
"The app is okay. I LOVED the widget. When I pause a song, my phone frequently drops Spotify from my lock screen and notifications. The widget was a quick, easy way to hit play or jump back in to the app to change playlists. So disappointed."
"Great service but app UI is hot garbage. It never syncs properly across devices, search flat out doesn't work sometimes... other flaws but I'm just exhausted"
This was my favorite music app but discontinuing the widget was a significant functional annoyance to me. I'll be looking at other services that offer widget functionality going forward.
"After significantly downgrading recently played, making playlists more difficult to navigate, removing lyrics, not having auto-resume, no search in playlist, and having an app with a glitch that can eat all of your memory (happened to my old S7), the removal of the widget - marking complaints as solved, shuttering the thread because it was growing so quickly as to be a corporate embarrassment, providing inept workarounds - is the final straw. Go elsewhere for streaming music, I will."
"My previous rating was 5 stars, but Spotify has gone downhill to the point that I no longer use it enough to justify the premium subscription. Something good - something worth paying for - has been needlessly ruined. Biggest disappointment is that they got rid of the Android widget, which was the main way I accessed Spotify. At first, I presumed it was technical glitch. No, some moron actually made a decision that Android users don't need a widget. How untethered to reality can a company be?"
"New updates were crappy, removing the widget just killed it. I'm good with UIs but all these changes are just ridiculous. Step your game up Spotify and you will quickly go back to 4+ stars in our books."
"they removed the widget, the most handy thing on the app. they jumbled up the user interface. dumb app altogether, would be 20x better if they simplified the UI and added back the widget."
"paying £10 a month and it's completely useless, everytime i lock my phone the music stops playing and doesn't resume until I press the home button, what a waste of money also happening continuously with my friend, tried deleting cache and reinstalling app and its ridiculous"
so complicated to use. songs kept adding to my playlist even though i dont want to hear them! wastes alot of time editing the playlist. not intuitive to use. uninstall
"Edit: Thanks for removing the widget, Spotify! What will you ruin next? Original: Spotify just can't leave well enough alone. They make sweeping changes to the interface for podcast listeners without even stopping to think about everyone who doesn't use Spotify for podcasts to begin with."
"The recent updates have made the app so much more difficult to use, there was absolutely no reason to change things so much and it largely ruins my experience in the app now. On top of this the android widget has been removed for no legitimate reason when this was my way of getting into the app and was an important feature for me. Likely won't be renewing my premium unless these things are addressed and I would rather spend money elsewhere for a better app than use the free version"
The app just keeps getting clunkier and clunkier. Recently the library UI changed for the worse and now they removed the widget for absolutely no reason at all.
"You keep taking away the greatest features of this service. Your last update ruined my listening experience and now you've taken away the most convinient feature that I've been using since I started my subscription.. The widget. Until you stop attempting to fix something that is NOT broken. You get 1 star. Stop messing with it or I'll be cancelling my sub, and I don't think I'm alone here."
"Spotify has been very good, good integration on hifi streaming equipment etc. However, they've just taken away the Widget feature for Android phones. As a severely sight impaired user, the widget is useful. please sack whoever's decided the removal of the widget was a good idea."
"They obviously do not care about their customers experience. i.e. taking away useful and popular features and adding exactly nothing in place of said ""retired"" features. I've been a customer since 2011, watching the app severely drop in user experience. Have already signed up with another service and will even pay Hulu separately on principle. Thanks for nothing Spotify."
newest updates have made the app clunkier and have removed the home screen widget. love spotify but its getting more difficult to find what I want to listen to quickly and efficiently.
"Library update ruined functionality and ease of use. Review will remain at 1 star until the libraby system is made intuitive and functional again. Update: Really, Spotify? Now you've killed the wiget? Who the hell is making the decisions over there? Time to look for a new music service..."
Bloody awful app. Unintuitive and lacking in features. Shame. If there was anywhere else i could get this range of music at this price for my entire family I'd be there.
"The new update is horrible!! I only use Spotify on my phone and now the app is horrible. Downloaded songs requiring internet to play, the widget (which i used constantly) is now gone. a plethora of other changes. I'm about to cancel my subscription just because the app just became worthless!!"
"UI is awful now, before the update it was great then one day stopped working. Removed and reinstalled the app and got the new UI which sucks. And they just removed the widget which I loved...blah."
"Last 2 major updates have all but ruined the app in terms of user friendliness. First the library section where you replaced all songs with a liked songs playlist which is far more tedious to scroll through, and also made it so you have to follow an artist to see them in the ""artists"" section. Now, the homescreen widget has been removed with no explanation on why. Already been trialling other services, getting very close to cancelling and switching entirely"
"The latest update removed recently played from your library so now the list on home is a lot smaller, also making all the playlist buttons bigger make it look clunkier and take longer to browse. Pls fix (Edit) Since the latest update random downloaded albums will delete themselves and then start redownloading, waste of time and data (Edit 2) you got rid of the home screen widget, which i found really useful. Thank you spotify, very cool"
"Whoever is in charge for product development at Spotify should be fired, but they probably won't, and we'll all just be told that our ""feedback is getting passed to the right folks."" If there's a surefire way to lose subscribers, it's removing features that likely required ZERO maintenance (i.e., widgets). Unfortunately, this seems to be a pattern with Spotify, and they've gimped their products in the past too. This wasn't the first, and likely won't be the last."
The last update that I had from you ruined the app. I can't connect and listen to my playlists on anything other than my phone. have uninstalled the app until further notice.
"Again an update in which the widget is lost! Almost all music in a nice app, although browse/category ui can be improved (always searching for whatsnew for example)"
"Had a family account for a long time. It came to a point where I seemed to lose access to add family members when I wanted to add my partner. Tried to remove all members and add them again, the app refused to let me add anyone at this point. Then tried to downgrade my account to a single person as I no longer wanted to pay for family if I couldn't use it. App wouldn't let me do that either. Ended up cancelling my subscription. Why would I pay for a service that I can't modify as I require?"
"Weird to focus on 'design changes' instead of stability... Spotify continue to 're-invent' their whole UI every time they make some changes, this just introduce more bugs. 2 things, i hope to see fixed: 1. When adding a song to a playlist, playlist seem to show up in random order, instead of your personal order. Annoying, when you have a lot of playlist... 2. No more widget's, for Android?"
"was happy using the service and then with latest update they got rid of the widget - no explanation, and there was nothing wrong with the widget; in fact it made the experience good as you can quickly navigate between songs and even see what the current/most recent played song is without launching the app"
"Removing the widget for this app on Android was a huge mistake. It was THE reason I was happy continuing to use Spotify, but I am going to find another service that has a media player widget. This is a neccessary feature. You dropped the ball with this one."
"Adds ruin the whole thing.. Completely. The quality of music is so good! But ads every 3 songs or so. All 1 minute, cant skip either. Sucks big time"
"First they forced the likes songs into a separate playlist and required an extra tap to search it. Now, they removed the widget. Your UI team needs to go on a timeout."
"Removed the Android widget, clearly used by many, with no explanation or warning. Since I used this daily and it made a poorly designed app much more usable and convenient, I just set a reminder to unsubscribe and delete if this isn't fixed this week."
"No more widget on home screen, requires a constant internet connection to open downloaded songs. Songs cut out in the middle of them and requires a restart. This latest update is garbage."
"Please indicate how updates will change the app. The current iteration seems to require an internet connection to load playlists, eve if those playlists are downloaded for offline listening."
love using spotify but after the latest update the widget has disappeared. this is one of the things I loved having on the homescreen as it gives you easy and quick access to spotify. please bring this ability back
The new UI is absolute garbage. spotify used to be my favourite app but it gets worse with every update to the point where it's almost impressive in a very sad way.
"The new UI is simply deficient. For example, they over complicated the way for you to search for a track in you own library, when it used to be as simple as scrolling up. Also, if you turn off Shuffle play, your songs will keep on playing randomly no matter how many times you turn it on and off."
"I was a wynk user for the past 4 years now and it came free with my airtel subscription. however once spotify launched, I quickly uninstalled everything and BOUGHT 6 month subscription. however since then everytime my screen gets locked while playing songs whether it's in my car or through bluetooth headset, the song pauses on it's own and as soon as I unlock my screen it resumes. it's very annoying. I need this fixed ASAP."
"I recommend not to waste your money on the premium. Constant freezing on every device I use (S9, xbox 1, Iphone). I have tried all the 'fixes' and will still shut off songs, which is quite frustrating while driving and running. Many other music apps that are much more reliable."
The ads are extremely irritating. Every time you press the back button to play some other song a Netflix pamphlet pops up and doesn't go no matter how many times you press the dismiss button. Uninstalling.
"The app always worked fine, yet with the new update Spotify takes a step away from what I have premium for: easy access to downloaded content. As an added bonus, all albums load extra slow now too. The last updated is a step away for user friendly local content, in favor of constant streaming, quite a disappointment"
I might as well go back to amazon music. I canceled my amazon because the UI is garbage on amazon music now spotify had to update theirs and ruin a perfect UI with this garbage one that seems more like a downgrade.
"freezing, lagging audio,crashing, opens blank, downloaded music isn't available. pure trash. built off of freeware.. fire everyone, and give up. how are you a streaming service that can't stream music?"
"if i can give 0 star, i will give it to this apps... spotify used to be very good, simple UI and non intrusive ads. now with the new update everything went wrong, cant even listen to one music in peace... to find/add a music to library has become more troublesome than ever. i used to be spotify fan, but now you have lost one of your customer.   learn from this word, IF IT AINT BROKE, DONT FIX IT"
"Before this update the app was temperamental but mostly fine. Now, you've removed some standard functions and essentially ruined the experience. Whoever is in charge of this rollout needs to better understand user experience. For a monthly fee that garuntees no artist ever makes a decent wage from music, I'd rather appreciate the platform they're using instead of resenting it."
"i kinda ""HATE"" this app i get that this app is for streaming music but it says to play music too so i made a playlist,it doesn't play, only in shuffle, and i wouldn't mind that BUT songs that I didn't put in my playlist keep playing it's annoying, and why can't i play music on replay?? i can't skip more than 6 songs per hour! THERE ARE ADS! I CAN'T EVEN SKIP THEM! and the music buttons i can only skip but can't go back,yes the music is great but whats the use if the app wants you to pay to enjoy"
"The application used to work fine prior to the recent big update. Now whenever I want to add a song to an existing playlist, they appear jumbled in a seemingly random order, sometimes sorted by most recent, sometimes not at all. Ive got a large number of playlists and folders, and the fact that their placement is randomized everytime makes adding songs a severe pain in the ass, as you've basically got to quickly read through every playlist until you hit the right one. Hopes this gets fixed soon."
"incredibly unintuitive interface that seems to want to force me to listen to everything in shuffle. I don't want to listen in shuffle, I don't want to listen to playlists or recommended songs, I just want to be able to select a song from an album and listen to it, which I find very difficult on mobile."
"The new ui update makes navigating your library in the app extremely difficult. The recently played section was extremely useful with the old ui but now it is on the home page in a downsized version, which can't even be accessed while offline. I read online that this update was to push podcasts but the podcast tab is even hard to navigate than the old update. Hopefully they will revert this update or people including myself may look into other streaming services."
"Great when it works, not very realiable unless you are a premuim user and download the song's you want to listen to before leaving Wi-fi. I can download this app, give it a review, sign up my credit card, and watch a music video on youtube and spotify will still tell me I am offline. Please add a ""I am online"" button that makes it recheck it itself, or sends an error report or something."
"shame you cant use it abroad for more than 14 days, the new UI is awful, and many other changes that make this not the best music streaming service as it was before. there are many things that need a fix too"
I have no idea why they've made the changes they have. The UX has become awful and counter-intuitive to use. Plus it seems to hang quite often when flicking between different screens such as playlist and search. Shame because the old app was actually excellent.
"i have autolay turned off and it should not be playing ""suggested"" songs but it still does. on top of that, the ""suggestions"" (poor choise of word because they are not optional) are beyond garbage and make my ears bleed. if you're new intention is to make people who were happy before opening your app completely miserable and ruin their workout and hours of their life (during which they need their ears to detox and relax in silence), congratulations. mission accomplished."
"starting all good. once my screen goes to sleep though my music stops, then once I touch one of my buttons on my phone music starts playing until screen goes to sleep again. I've uninstalled and reinstalled about 4 times now but same thing happens. fix this asap"
"this app sucks ass if you dont feel like coughing up $10 a month to satisfy the spotify gods. you cant even look up a single song and listen to it in some god damn peace without having to ""shuffle play"" a playlist of songs like the song you looked up, then 3 songs after you finally get the original song you wanted to hear. i get they want to incesntivise people to buy premiuim but thats just some BS, as if you guys dont have enough ads. if the music you like is on soundcloud just listen on there"
Spotify are determined to ruin this app. They keep making the app less and less user friendly particularly for android users. They for unknown reasons took away the ability to easily find songs in a playlist by swiping down (a feature which is still available on Apple devices) 9 months ago and still haven't rectified it. They've now ruined the user interface and taken away the saved songs/artists/albums section.
"The new update has ruined the library experience completely. Additionally, the app now crashes during login and won't open. Reinstall, reboot, nothing helps."
"Bruv the new UI is hot garbage. I'm canceling my six month premium trial because I don't even want to use it for free. If you're looking for a decent streaming service, consider Apple Music or Tidal."
"Ever since aug 1st update, maybe a couple days earlier, I can't even open the app half the time - the screen just glitches out attempting to log in, and eventually crashes the app. This happens even when offline I can't play songs offline when I have data on; it tries to use my data and stops playing music when i set it to offline. It quits playing songs for no reason periodically qnd closes the app completely if I switch to a different app while music is playing. Won't even let me log in now :("
"I've been a customer for years and looks like I feel the same way as everyone else about the latest update...its so counter intuitive and it's become almost impossible to use. also, they have basically no complaints procedure, you have to post your 'feedback' on a forum and hope it gets enough up votes from other users for them to even read it! F*ing ridiculous!"
"This app has good music and sound quality but I paid for spotify premium for a better experience. But for some reason everytime I open spotify I have to download all my songs again.... and quite a few time, spotify just logged out of itself so i have to keep logging in repeatedly. And that is a really crappy experience because I'm paying for better results and so I can listen without using data."
"this new update is unintuitive and complete garbage. update for july , this app still sucks and its even worse now all of my artists are unorganized so I cant find the ones i want to hear easily because the order is all randomized and even if I filter it to order them by artists it still leaves it in some stupid random order. idk why you guys even bother with updates if you just make everything worse."
The new app UI is a huge step backwards for Spotify. Bring back the sort albums by date added at the very least. Shame!
"the app quits in the middle of my songs for no reason. i have installed all updates and am switching to amazon prime for 99 cents the next three months. if I like them I'm switching. I teach classes and when your play list cant keep up, that's a problem."
Simplicity in terms of UX can sometimes be good but not if you sacrifice features that clearly needs to be there. You literally cannot shuffle all the songs you've downloaded without having to 'Like' or add them all individually to a new playlist. Please allow us to Shuffle All Songs from different playlist we follow or downloaded. No one has the time to individually like or add each song to a playlist. Just a terrible UX decision. At least allow multiple song selection for liking or adding 😪
"Hi, I don't know if it's a bug or restriction for free account that when we go back from song screen to change playlist, we land on an ad. if we dismiss it we land back to song. now if we click back again it takes us to that ad. we can't change the song. we have to close the app and restart it. if it is a restriction it is a wired one blocking is from using app. Very bad user experience. regards, Rohit"
"a long time ago when spotify didnt RUIN it for me, you could get awsome songs and there wasnt premium, but now that there is I have limit to skip songs and I cant even go back to songs I wanna listen to again, instead I have to wait for my playlist to finish, also back then without premium i could choose a song and play it, but now I need premium for that?! that is really stupid spotify! AND WHAT HAPPENED TO 30 MIN. AD FREE MUSIC?! NOT HAPPY spotify, please go back to your old ways PLEASE!"
Used to love Spotify until the UI was changed. Getting rid of the library was the worst possible decision they could have made. It is now tedious and time consuming to build a playlist since I can't browse what artists I have saved music from. I am cancelling my sub until this change is reverted
"Not able to skip songs in free mode, I mean I'm agree with advertising it's quite ok but skipping songs I don't like? I better use YouTube same amount of advertising but I can skip infinitely...."
"Updates brought a terrible UI, and less features that i loved about spotify in the past. I'll be switching to another music streaming service, since this one makes bad decisions towards customer service."
"The new update sucks ass. It's buggy. I've just had to delete and re-install it.... again. Now I'll have to rebuild my damn library... again. Plus I can't simply go offline and shuffle my downloaded songs. Where is the simple 'songs' heading gone? Why Spotify? Why? I really thought we had something special. It's not that I'm angry, just disappointed."
wow. way to ruin the app!!! after being forced to listen to 4 ads in a row I uninstalled this app. that's a bit excessive and just feels like y'all trying to punish people for not buying premium. 1 ad in between songs was understandable. 4+ ads is not.
"After the latest update, the albums under my library don't load. The problems persist after I've done both a quick and a clean reinstall of the app."
"The UI needs serious remodelling. I'm using an old APP version for landscape as some genius people at Spotify thought that going from landscape library to portrait player (while in landscape) will mean they have to work less for fixing the UI, they are causing the company serious damages. Also the Spotify has some ""Genius"" moments to add in useless features like lyrics or videos. The idea might sound good on paper, but the main goal of Spotify is to stream music, not to entertain the developers. FIX THE UI! Make a proper landscape version that does not leave 40% of screen for actual song list and 60% for static decorations"
Why does every playlist shuffle?! I pay premium and yet everything shuffles? Why does it do this? I've reinstalled yet nothing seems to fix it. I've dug through everything I can find and there's no Shuffle option enabled anywhere. It's ruining my listening experience...
"The new update is absolutely awful and an infuriating experience all round. An app that i have loved and used daily for years is now all but ruined and unusable as far as I'm concerned. if it doesn't change back, or get fixed soon i will uninstall my premium family account and use GooglePlay instead."
Spotify users: are you having issues with your account freezing on phones. I've just gone for walk and had my Spotify on and found that I've had to keep pressing the power button to get music to play. It's as though the app is freezing when backlight is off on phone - very frustrating and annoying as hard to keep in good rythem. I'm considering on cancelling subscription as result
Search function sucks. More difficult toe use than the desktop app. After finding what you searched you only have shuffle play as option. Just give the search result and the play button next to the item.
"I spent a month testing another streaming platform and came back just to be surprised by this ""new"" design (apparently the default for more than a month now). I'm so angry, it's absolutely terrible. I used to add just specific songs from albums to my library and find them through their artwork and now I can only find albums I saved in full at the albums section. And I can't even tell how upset I am with this ""Liked Songs"" playlist replacing the Songs section and the removal of Recently Played."
"The app was amazing until the most recent update, which has pretty much ruined the app and due to the update I lost around 4000 songs, I'll still use it as the choice of music is still pretty good compared to others. Mabey in future spotify should ask its users what they want before they make a significant interface set up change."
The app is great but it keeps cutting itself off for no reason. It's not even putting itself on pause it just quits. The solution is simple give it some attention it corrects itself. It just sucks having to constantly babysit it all the time.
"The desktop app is good, but this app is so unintuitive and frustrating. I try to play a specific song after I have only played it once, and it just locks me in shuffle in a way that I can never play that song again. I simply cannot reccomend this app."
"No other way to describe this update other than 1 star. No more genres, no more ordered list of playkist, no more specificoty at all! Your audience is not grandparents and podcast users! Hell, even the podcast users had an easy time before! ALSO NOTHING LOADS QUICK!!!! I have a nice phone and ALL albums load slow. Bro, if you got an iphone just do apple music. leave me here in this Spotify update misery. I waited a while to do this review but here we are."
"since the update, the UI became absolutely useless. I just want to acces all song I added to my profil but it's either not possible anymore or it became so complicated that I didn't find how. I don't want my song organized by playlist or artist. I just want the good old library with all the song in one place. Do not use this app and I will resign my premium account as well."
"This new update ruined the app, go back to the previous setup, I can't get a songs list or shuffle play with ease. Y'all need to pull your heads out your rears and take this update out."
"I've been having problems with this app for a while now it wasn't just this last update or two, but its now to the point where im just bewildered, I am a premium account and im quite dissapointed with the new performance,,, and I still see bugs and issues from 2017."
"I initially started with a free subscription, which I then upgraded to premium, simply to be able to go offline. I have since stoped premium but are now not able to play anything, not even prefered music without shuffle. However, this wasnt the case when I initailly signed up under the free version. Spotify, you will loose me as an altogether user if you don't revert this shuffle quimick nonsense under a free subscription."
the new user interface ruined the app. I have had premium for about a year now and now Im moving over to APPLE MUSIC. Atleast with APPLE MUSIC I can download a song from an artist and then go to my artist tab and find said artist. crazy.
"since one of the recent updates the app is way more complicated, very hard to find all songs, can't find how to delete individual downloads from an album either. don't like the layout... why ruin a good app? might have to change to another music streaming it is so horrible... have to like all the songs to be able to pay them all randomly???"
"I don't like this app. It has nothing any other app doesn't have. You need to have over 15 songs in your playlist otherwise they'll add completely unrelated songs which you can't remove. And when you download it on your phone you can't skip more than 6 songs per hour! What kind of idiot designed that? Also when you can't make more than 6 skips per hour you can't change the song at all. Besides, why the heck do they charge you money for downloading a song? Absolute rubbish by Spotify! I hate it!"
"it looks like Spotify is making aware and intentional decisions to damper and worsen the user experience inside the application. There's absolutely no other plausible explanation for what is happening with this app in those latest months. A layout change by a company this big does not happen without thorough research and study, and yet, we see basic functions being butchered and made worse with every update: we lost basic functions that worked just fine before..."
"Used to love it, but with the latest update and designs it's lost it practical side. Considering changing providers."
Commercials on the free version won't pause even though I repeatedly click on the pause button. They won't even turn off even though I close the app via the task manager. Will switch to the first app that stream music but isn't as invasive as this one if given the chance.
"thanks, app used to be great and i was happy to pay but you've RUINED it with that last update , were you drunk making it ?! i had to go online and search for an apk to install the previous version that was, you know, USER FRIENDLY AND INTUITIVE ... i had to look up tutorials on how to find my music on your new update this is ridiculous"
"The new update removed perhaps my biggest use of Spotify: The ability to save an Album and remove so gs you don't care for. Years of keeping only my favorite songs from each album are ruined by the new update that added all of the other songs *back into my library*! Also, this ""Liked"" song thing is nonsense."
New UI is terrible! Please change it back! I've been a premium user for years. I had hundreds of artists in alphabetical order. If it doesn't change back asap I'm off somewhere else.
"Difficult to navigate my saved artists now. Albums aren't in alphabetical order unless you have the whole album saved, and artists arent in alphabetical order unless you're following them. This new update ruined Spotify. Considering just cancelling my subscription because this isn't worth paying for anymore."
"The app is great but with every update it gets less intuitive. you have to do more clicks now in order to search through your library, its uncomfortable on the go. it has a serius and EXTREMELY annoying problem with my chromecast, the app starts itself compulsively as im watching something else and freezes there. repeat mode activates itself such as shuffle does too."
"no play next option, can't tell it not to play annoying songs/artists, you can't restart a playlist without clicking through to your library, annoying amount of clicks to get to your library, annoying features that are useless and probably use up my data and power while important features are missing. Going back to google music. EDIT: looks like the dislike/ban button is there sometimes and sometimes not. took off another star for being confusing af"
Why have you done this? My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. Why can I no longer see the music I have listened to recently? My small rat brain requires an absolute vacancy of effort and needs to be constantly reminded as to what it is doing. Please fix this or I'm going back to CD's.
"new update is terrible, it sometimes takes minutes to load my already downloaded offline playlists. i will be online but it will not let me access the menu saying ""i need to be online to see this menu"", & now crashes frequently, quite frustrated with this new update"
"This is one of the best music apps but one flaw was enough to ruin the entire experience for me, the ads which are shown get stuck and don't respond to any of the commands even the dismiss button doesn't work and this happens every time an ad is shown. To get rid of the ad I have to restart the app. Please resolve this issue at the earliest as i am a very big fan of this app"
"Every other update causes problems. The current one has had the issue of podcast episodes not playing for ages when I press the play button, as well as Bluetooth connected devices not being able to rewind on podcasts. I cannot be bothered going through the forums and doing big reports. So bloody frustrating and I wish the developers would just make sure everything works before the update is released."
"I'm a long time Spotify user and i love Spotify but this new design is so awful I've reverted to the old version. its harder to navigate, less navigation features, and the way they list your artists is irritatingly stupid. I will never update again if this is the future of Spotify."
Terrible experience so far. I like listening to songs on repeat but there is no repeat button. Went online on spotify website to ask for help because you can't directly from app but it didnt help AT ALL they dont have any results regarding this issue. Deeply saddened.
"Junes update ruined the app, clunky, freezes, fails to load list of saved albums and time consuming to find what you are looking for. Also you can only see the homepage if you have wifi now"
"Man the UI layout terribly sucks or rather is not functional , I have been using this app as a new premium user and I was satisfied at the moment. But you ruined it everything wirh the latest update . It crashes and has many other bugs . Also why the hell isn't there a list of what got updated ? Like several other apps that do that you know . No need to be sneaky about that . I am disappointed now ! Probably wont change anything to you guys but still this app now is screwed up !"
What a garbage UI update. Do you seriously expect people who had hundreds of artists already saved to their libraries to go back through and tediously use the follow function just to try to reproduce a feature that was never even broken in the first place? Its not streamlined. Its not convenient. Its not helpful. If that was the goal just give users the ability to add tags and organize their own damn libraries already instead of patronizing them like toddlers.
"Been a premium subscriber for years, June 2019 update has made the UI so bad I would recommend pretty much any competing music streaming service over spotify at this point. Likely will cancel."
"it says to tap now to watch a 30 second video for an hour of commercial free music and there is no ""tap now"" button anymore after my last update....doesnt matter where you tap, nothing happens"
"I loved this app at first but like all of the other negative comments, the update ruined it. My music keepe getting deleted, if i shut down my phone completely i have to redownload all of my music, and a lot of the time my music just doesn't download, even when i have 6GB on my phone. Please fix this app"
"New update ruined the app. Takes forever to open an album saved locally on your device, totally ruined the way I organize my music. I would rather use Apple music for Android, shm."
Update forcing me to find a new service. very disappointed with the many changes that have only negatively impacted the listening experience. My biggest regret is the time it will take to port and rebuild my library on another streaming platform.
"The new interface is completely unusable!! I don't know who got the idea of modifying it, but he should be fired. If there is no update soon that reverts to an interface where I can scroll through the artists that I like, I will honestly consider quitting my subscription and joining deezer. This is deeply disappointing, please fix this issue soon"
"Spotify used to be the number 1 music app, far away above the others. This last update has ruined everything that made Spotify great. No more easy to use and simple UI. No more browse section? Downloaded music is much harder to use. I'm over it, if they don't change it soon I'll be gone."
Bad updates ruined user experience and interface. All the functionality is gone and the app looks terrible with big ugly icons. Just delete this version and re-release the old one. Or call this one Spotify Lite.
Go back to the old design. The new UI/UX has had no thought put into it. Absolute mess of an app currently (July 2019)
"they have poor customer service. i could not find a contact number for them over the last month or so, and have been charged yet again for a subscription that i wished to cancel quite a while ago. i think it's kind of sad that they don't have this otions, it's like they dont want to communicate until they get a bad review. i wrote them an email, still have recieved no refund in over a month. i do not recommend them if you look for customer service in a brand"
the new UI is not intuitive. i also don't like the new 'liked' playlist. it doesnt make sense that i have to separately download an album and then 'like' it to add it to this new 'liked' playlist. huge waste of time.
"Total grab! UI is getting worse every ""update"". Don't pay!!! I beg that Spotify would keep their business platform and open UI development for developers. Every amateur nerd would make a better job! There's no logic how UI functions neither how it changes from an update to another. How about making a basic Android app style UI at first? Normal functionality and normal logic. Would make a huge improvement! Spotify: you're ruining your business, wasting investor's money and driving people crazy."
"bring back the downloaded songs tab. it's so frustrating to find my music now. I have over 4000 songs downloaded but I can only easily listen to less than half of them now that you have to ""like"" every individual song to get them to appear in a playlist. most annoying thing ever. the last update ruined this."
In the past it is such a quality app that was simple to use. Now jump to present day there is so many bugs since after the May update especially you still not have fixed that bug that music randomly pauses when the phone is on standby mode and i know for a fact numerous reports are been made about this bug and still nothing was done about and especially when you are a premium user it is quite annoying and also bring the old UI because is what Spotify made great in the first place.
"I hate the UI change in the recent update - just personal prefence as I prefer to treat the app as a virtual record collection rather than just listening to playlists, but Spotify should have considered users like me I think, and now the app just doesn't suit me. However, what is NOT a personal preference is the newly introduced bug: albums and artists take about 10 seconds to load which is very frustrating. Spotify, did you test your app at all?"
"Dunno what's happened, but since the last couple updates it just spazzes out flashing the loading screen & that, so I simply can't use it any more (I'm on an LG V30). Back when it worked though, it was alright. Obviously Spotify is a lame company for shoving it's deliberately annoying ads down your throat until you pay them to shut up, I hardly ever hear an ad from an actual brand. Don't quite get what people buy premium for considering it's just songs that you can download elsewhere any time :)"
"Wow this new update is bad. I have 1000's of saved songs from 100's of different artists and now I have exactly one artist in that section. I LIKE listening to individual artists, and I am NOT going to go through and tediously follow 100's of artists that SHOULD be already there if I have a saved song from them. Fix this absolute trash UI change."
I think everything about spotify was great until the latest update and now the setup is awful. I can't even access an alphabetical list of the artists or songs in my library. I could not be more frustrated with Spotify. Don't ruin a good thing!
"Never wrote a review before, but jesus christ this new update is god awful. If it wasn't bad enough that it completely ruins the flow of the app, it takes forever to do anything. Unless they spontaneously change the app back to how it was (which i highly doubt based on how much time has gone by), you're better off with Apple Music"
Bring back the songs tab in the app! my whole listening experience has been ruined since I now have to sift through thousands of songs instead of being able to shuffle play all
"My artists used to be neatly organized in alphabetical order, now I have to ""Follow"" all of them or else they're just lumped together in a mess with no order at all. Terrible redesign of the library totally ruined the app."
"This new update is horrible. The ""Save"" button no longer ""likes"" the songs in an album automatically, then if you unsave an album that all the songs are liked, it still leaves the songs in your ""Liked Songs"". I don't care about playlists - give me my music library back!"
UI update makes this unusable. All of my liked songs are now in a playlist and the artists page is almost nonexistant. When i use this app i usually just go to browse by artist for albums ive liked. Please change it back or have an option to change it back.
"Ruined a perfectly good app by adding a 'liked songs' feature which seems to separate downloaded tracks from your 'liked songs' playlist, which also appears to have replaced. If i want to 'like' songs to make a playlist I'll just make a playlist. I have a number of the auto generating playlists (e.g.release radar) set to auto download, I just connected to WiFi and downloaded 47 songs and they dont appear in my liked songs so i have literally no idea what they are... add the library again for 5*"
"Recent update is bad user experience. As someone who likes to listen to their library, the recent update has made it profoundly difficult to navigate the artists, albums and songs I used to scroll through without issue. Absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary change that has me seriously considering the switch to a different streaming service, deapite Spotify having been my sole music streaming + listening service for the past 6 years."
"new update is awful. I've been loyal to spotify for years but their new UI is NOT user friendly and to put it simply, awful. ive had spotify premium for atleast 2 years and I cancelled it immediately after this update. they have changed and/or removed things unnecessarily, even some of their best features. they've also been adding stuff for no good reason and it's made the app messy and annoying. I'm fed up, along with most of the userbase."
Everything was good untill we had the overlay ad on top of UI. The dismiss button won't click... The background UI registers the click and I dont know where i end up trying to frantically click to remove that God Foresaken- Spotify originated blasphemy of an ad.
"Used to love it, now I hate it. 1. Imagine coming home and someone has rearranged the knobs and buttons on your stereo. 2. so difficult to find what you want, because unless you ""follow"" every artist, none of the non-followed artists are sorted alphabetically. Maybe you don't ""follow"" every artist because you don't want a giant playlist of ALL your music. 3. Now you can't tell which of your music is downloaded and which is not. Moving to Apple Music"
constantly changing cant listen to your downloaded songs without wasting time building playlists. no more than 40 songs of suffle. turned into a joke be ready to be disappointed
"Spotify seems to get worse with every update. I have the premium version, but at this point I'm considering moving to another app. It's almost unbearable to use. It's quite sad, since not that long ago Spotify was just about perfect."
"made the buttons for pause, next, and previous song way too big in the screen where you view the song. got rid of the radio section, and messed up the entire system of organization. please allow us to either download an older version or revert these changes."
"The new update is just stupid, I can't download a song, and the new method of sorting songs is just weird and not intuitive at all"
"After the update: Interface is unintuitive, app is incredibly slow to load any songs/artist/album data, difficult to find what I'm actually looking for when searching, offline capabilities have been reduced, have seen a spike in data usage. Tl;dr - Not worth premium, at this rate."
"UI has been changed, community votes ignored ""we seem to be getting a lot of different ideas"", 703 comments almost all negative, bring back the artist view and add a ""suggested artists"" view to the library, not hard! If these poor changes continue I will abandon spotify as a service and go elsewhere."
Interface change was bad but also messed with the widget and now its too small to use. Music service is good but bad UI decisions.
"terrible. absoloutely hate the new update that has ruined my library and usability. all my downloaded songs/library are no longer in the one place so I can just shuffle my music. worst idea for an update ever. now everything is in a ""liked songs"" playlist. i haven't even liked any songs! spotify did it for Me! and this also means I need to use my mobile data to shuffle songs or go through every playlist I have. change it back!!! also my playlists have been reorganised so they're no longer in dat"
"This update ruined this app for me, I can no longer choose the song i want to stream to my PC, i can only use the shuffle option now, this app is basically useless now if you dont have premium."
"Spotify used to be amazing before all the recent updates over the past year. Now all it can be described as is a messy, buggy, slow and ugly app that is barely functional. For the first time ever I'm genuinely thinking of passing over to Itunes or Tidal"
"The library redesign is truly awful... Having to switch to Apple Music isn't ideal, but it's hella functional compared to the current Spotify design."
"New UI is extremely slow, especially to load an album (usually up to 10 seconds). Furthermore I feel like Spotify is structurally trying to discourage users from maintaining a library, making it less convenient with almost every update over the years, pushing people to mindlessly put on a terrible automatic playlist that inevitably features Ed Sheeran"
New UI update is far inferior to the old version. inability to search through downloaded songs is inexcusable and ridiculous. I am truly disappointed.
"Bad UI update. Fix what you all did to the UI, there was no need to take away the recents tab which already had playlist access. Fix It."
"The new UI is really bad. It trades functionality and good overview over your library for... yeah, for what exactly? I can't see a single aspect that was improved by this..."
The new UI sucks!! the main reason I pay for premium is to listen to music offline. Now when you're offline you don't have Home anymore!! which I loved to have because it has recent played songs.
"The app is completely trash. It takes ages to even play a selected song, UI is terrible and just doing anything on the app takes some time."
"You have completely ruined Spotify. Why on earth would you get rid of ""Songs""?! I can now only shuffle songs through the ""liked songs"" bit, which only has around 5,000 of the songs I have saved."
Fix the repeat and shuffle buttons. Playlist automatically stop when you finish them instead of just starting over. Not cool.
"Latest update ruins the app. You can't listen to just the songs you've liked in an album, it forces you to listen to either the whole album or every song you've liked by that artist. Was much better before. Need to revert that change."
"The new update (June, 2019) was the worst thing to ever happen to this app. Change it back, and I swear to god if I get a response to send you an email, I'll be going over to Tidal. How about you give your customers the option to keep what ever update they want rather than forcing us to use your stupid/ugly UI you want. OR BETTER YET, JUST ASK US. Let us use it for a day, and if we dont like it, we'll say we dont like the update. SIMPLE AS THAT."
"The newest interface is horrendous, in an attempt to streamline the experience its overcomplicated things, now unless I'm following an artist they no longer appear in my artist library, all songs I've saved for offline use have been consolidated automatically to one playlist, also removing the feature where saved songs would appear as an artist displaying just the saved songs and albums, the songs tab has disappeared, repeat and shuffle have been hidden behind another button. This needs fixing."
"This app has the worst UI ever. I just want to choose songs and play them, but it's constantly popping up distractions and autoplaying the wrong song."
Why do you keep deleting my reviews? You aks our opinions and then remove it when it doesn't fit your criteria? Are you serious? The app crashes anytime you do something other than use Spotify. I can't listen to more than two songs before it crashes and now it's gotten to the point where it stops working even when I have Spotify open. This has been going on for months please fix it so we can get the proper use for the subscription those of us are paying for. And quit deleting reviews.
"the recent update ruined the experience for me, add that to them discouraging contacting them regarding problems forcing you to crowdsource the customer service from their forums, and one of the lowest payouts for artists, I cancelled my subscription and switched to Napster. Much happier now."
"I am really not liking this new update. It has completely ruined my Spotify experience. I would love it if Spotify would go back to the format it was before, or something similar. The only reason I don't switch to Apple Music or Google Play Music is because I have devices that can not switch."
"They are still not able to implement offline mode properly. That's just sad. Come on, need convenient menu with quick access."
"everytime I try and listen to music it crashes my phone and makes me restart the system UI only been like this since the latest update tho, it used to be the best app for music."
Fix the backlog of eternally broken features instead of dithering with the UI constantly. shuffle is completely broken when using spotify connect. Discover weekly is eternally recommending the same handful of bad song. i shouldnt have to tell an app twice (dislike-->dislike song/artist) that i dont like a song. stop pushing Drake etc down our throats.
"new update is utter rubbish. the app doesn't work when in offline mode. it tells me to go online to play my downloaded music!? UI is unpleasant. constantly crashing when it struggles to load. it's not like it's my handset, as I've just upgraded from the galaxy s8 to s10. Please do something about these problems"
"It still works, I guess, although the new UI made me lose ALL MY SONGS. Can't have only a few select songs from an album. Must save to library AND like all songs? What THE HELL is this new UI? Premium cancelled. Uninstalled. I'll make sure to actually use and PAY for one of the competitors because I don't know what they were trying to do with this UI, the fact that they went ahead and implemented it despite how awful it is is a testament to Spotify's incompetence. They deserve no customers."
"Premium is not an upgrade. It's a requirement. -you can't choose what song you want to play from a (selfmade) playlist or even a song you search, only a preview. playlists are shuffled. -you can't fast forward songs or go back. -you can skip 6 songs every hour, what the hell? why? -advertisements, what a joke. before the first song starts already and in between songs(every 4-5 songs) not just 1 ad. But 3 20-30 seconds ads of which ~50% is from sporify themselves telling you to buy premium."
"New UI is pure garbage. No saved music or ordering anymore. Just ""liked"" songs and an unordered list of ""recommended"" artists. Useless."
The update removed the ability to have an actual button on my notification bar for going offline mode. That was the deal breaker right then and there. I'll keep it at one star until fixed.
"Super frustrated with new updates on desktop and mobile. Especially that you removed songs section from the list, now I can't play randomly through all my songs and they weren't added to specific playlist, I've build my likes for years and now it's gone. #bringitback #hatechanges #intuitivedesign try failed."
The app stops every now and then. Then i have to press play button again. Very very irritating 03/07/2019 my music stops now on almost every song. this is crazy!!!! can anyone get back to me???????
"This is the first time I have ever left an app review. Premium user for 4+ years, opened the app today to find the entire library of saved music I built over the years is gone. Way to destroy the user experience in one fell swoop Spotify."
its irritative if it will get stuck on the ad page there is no option to come to the home screen every time you will press back button ad page will display then the page on which song which is playing and same.
"Redesigned the ""Your Library"" page for the worst, it now wastes loads of space showing a ""Liked Songs"" playlist that I dont even want and makes it harder to actually find the music you want to get to like your Recently Listened"
new update sucks. keeps telling me i need to be connected to the internet to see and use my downloaded library. also the new UI is terrible. its not as east to navigate or filter my dowloads as it was before. i may just end up cancelling my subscription over this. 😡
"Only way to get your point across is a one star review so here it is. Old UI was better this new one is for people who barely use the library tab, makes it very tedious to listen to an artist you have in your library in the new update."
"Stop taking features away. I'm about to drop Premium because of stupidity like removing the ""Dislike"" button. Your radio mixes and playlists have always been far worse than Pandora's and now I can't even remove your awful suggestions from my radio or mixes? Laughable."
"the new update has ruined this app, i use it all the time more so connected to android auto in my car. since the update i cant play my library (which is no longer a library but a playlist called liked songs) it starts half way through and shuffles songs even though shuffle isnt turned on (i have a premium account which means it shouldn't shuffle unless i want it to). the previous version was the best."
"the newest update is T E R R I B L E. The UX makes no sense, my songs are all in a playlist now for some reason, the app won't sort artists alphabetically anymore....Seriously, Spotify, PLEASE put it back the way it was. Just show me my damn music, alphabetically, under tabs with sensible labels like 'Songs', 'Artists', and 'Albums'."
"for me, the UI/user experience is soo low, i just can't describe it... no real options, mostly remastered, that i do not want, and can't filter out... canceling my membership (premium)"
"Only ads anytime. They even locked possibility to shift from a playlist to another or to the favourite songs list. I didn't pay for it with money that's true, but listening up to all these ads is worse than paying and fruitful to the ones who hold the rights of the app.. I don't want to pay for it. Thank you for convincing me to unistall this poor and irritating app from my phone."
"New UI changes make picking individual songs impossible, and there's no easy way to view recently listened to. You can't save partial albums anymore. New bug: When you play music on a Sonos, the queue of the rest of the album is replaced by the other songs by the artist in alphabetical order - so you can't listen to an album anymore unless you speficially queue it. This is when playing music through ""Artist"" and not ""Album""."
"Within 2 days of having premium, my account was hacked... What's worse, is that you need to login to contact customer support. How am I supposed to log in when someone changed my email and password to their own?! Whatever you do, dont use your Facebook to log in or pay for premium. If you get hacked, the person can use your spotify information to ruin your life. Also, use a new and separate password for spotify."
"The new UI has become horrible to use. I can't find anything. The only thing I know for sure is where my podcasts are, and even then, setting it up is a mission. I wish I could uninstall to previous versions :("
"I used to save whole albums to my saved songs (now called ""liked songs"") and with the new update, they're not on order anymore. That really puts me off this app. I also dont like how I have to download and like and album or save it just to have it in my songs and still be downloaded. Good app. Please, on behalf of everyone, for God's sake please bring back the old UI and how everything worked then. it was fine until the most major update. Thanks."
"the most recent big update sucks. I cant save a full album the way I did before. I have to manually like one by one of the songs for them to appear in that damn new ""liked songs"" playlist. Plus it was easier to search for specific songs in my library. Now it requires more taps and its pretty annoying when Im in a hurry. Also, whenever I connect to my car the damn notification about waze integration keeps pestering me until I restart my phone. Its pretty buggy and ugly AF overall. Im not happy."
"im giving one star temporarily (hopefuly) to express my hatred when big companies recide to ruin a good procduct by removing features and making UI less convenient for the user. i mean, come on who had a problem with a couple more buttons at the bottom forsuper easy access..."
"When it first launched in Romania I bought premium without thinking. Now I am very close to cancelling it and buying another music streaming service because the app became almost a mockery. You changed it so much and without reason that you made horrible. The home screen has nothing usefull on it. Where are recommendatios, made for me and all the rest that were in previous versions or in the desktop app? You removed the search bar which is very hard to understand why would you do that and many other problems. The fact that it doesn't remind to shuffle after you choose another song manually it has my nerves stretched to maximum. I don't know if you have done any usability testing but I think you don't respect your customers and you don't actualy care about their needs. the latest design and all the changes that you constantly do reflect a big lack of proffesionalism and make the app look like it was designed by a junior designer not some pros."
"Horrible UI update ruined the app. Layout is extremely unintuitive, good features were removed for no apparent reason, and songs are harder to manage now. Overall using the app now feels clunky and annoying, I wish there was a good alternative so that I could stop using Spotify"
"Spotify is getting greedy by the day. I cant play the song i want, cant listen the song from the beginning because i had a conversation, forces me to play ' shuffle' random extra songs that i dont want,I cant go back because ads play again if you pause, close and reopen app. I would get premium but i dont want to, because they're forcefully ruining the experience so i must get a premium. it is cruel. uninstalling."
they upgraded it and now I cant find the songs I've saved or recently played. I've spent the last couple of years very happy paying premium only now I'm considering quitting it. I'm not happy and am very frustrated with this new update. please put it back the way it was or at least give others options of how they like it.
Latest update is a pile of flaming trash. You guys completely ruined the library portion of the app. Can't easily see songs by artist or albums like before. Been a premium subscriber for years and am now looking to switch to another service thanks to this latest change.
"They messed up with the new way of organising songs, albums, and artists. the UI is confusing now, plus, some playlist of mine were removed with no advice. I'd like that we come back to the old interface, please."
"Latest update is terrible. Artists no longer appear in a logical alphabetical order, and loading a saved artist is now so slow it is almost unusable. Also can't quickly see what is downloaded."
"It is absolutely ridiculous that they have put a limit to how often you can skip songs per hour with a system that already has advertisements built in. who comes up with this stuff? how far gone is the app market that you limit something as unassuming as song skips? ridiculous. the app of course works properly but free is a gross overstatement. i suppose if you don't mind being given what to listen to, listening to ads (which is fine) and also constantly being nagged to upgrade, but not for me."
"So I had to go back to using the free version as I was out of work and everything had been fine. however after you last 2 updates you have completely ruined your users experience and the gui. I mean I can't even select a song to play, you just get a 10 second clip what the hell is that about is that what I pay £10 a month for, your having a laugh. gonna be switching to a different service"
"As many others have said, the newest UI update has completely destroyed the app. only shuffling through random songs is really possible now, you cannot easily search through your artists or albums, an internet connection is required to search for each individually.. Why have they done this? The mobile app is now completely useless for me..."
The new UI is disgusting. Artists are sorted by recommended and there's no way to change it. Bring the old UI back. It wasn't broken. Why fix it?
The new update has made it almost impossible to listen to music in a convenient way. I wish there was a way to have an option to switch to the old UI. This spotify customer is not happy.
"I've been using Spotify for over 5 years now, and I LOVE the app. But, the newest update has completely ruined the layout. Please, Spotify, make a new update to fix it, soon."
"youve absolutely ruined this app with the last update, offline mode is none existent, nearly my whole library is missing and even the playlists ive made are none functional. smh, ruined the best music apl there was."
"You have to press an additional button (compared to a month ago) on your screen to filter your saved songs in Playlist. This is very bad UX, go and fix it."
"The recent update has pretty much ruined the whole experience, used to save all the songs & albums I liked and shuffle play in ""My Songs"". ""My Songs"" has disappeared and been replaced by ""My Liked Songs"" which only includes songs that have been liked, not saved. Bring the saved songs playlist back."
"They should execute the team that made the new design, they redesigned the interface making it really hard to navigate now, the recently played section is beyond broken and useless. The library is even worse. Why they decided to get rid of easy to read and navigate list in exchange for scrollable horizontal list is beyond me. I will cancel premium after this and go with other options, it's unbelievable that something this badly done was approved and released."
"The new update blows. It plays the same song 2x, then the next song 2x, and so on... then after 10 songs or so, it quits playing, though the ap is still open. anyone else having this problem?"
"The June 2019 update completely ruined the UI. Bring back the ability to filter my library by individual songs, and what's downloaded on my phone. I don't care about your recommended artists. I don't need the name of the artists there taking up 1/5 of my screen just to include a picture of them. Total garbage"
"For some bizarre reason you can no longer see a list of your songs, it forces you to search for them. It's also very difficult to find the option to download a song for offline use. It was already a poor UI and it's now missing basic features I use frequently."
New update is Terrible! The inability to pull up alphabetically ordered lists of artists whose songs you've liked without having to painstakingly follow every single artist is infuriating! Worst UI ever!
UI change has made this app horrible. All my saved songs are now gone and I cant even view any artists I still have saved in alphabetical order??? Why did you have to mess up a good thing?!
"The UI design is really bad. There is no room for customization. For some one who doesn't listen to podcasting, what's the point of the displaying top podcasts on my home screen??"
"Giving this a 1 star after the last update. Organizing my music has become so painful after the last update. Nothing is clear and intuitive. This whole ""liked playlist"" thing has ruined everything. I had to figure out how to add an album to the ""liked playlist"" (not easy and clear at all) and I still have no idea how to remove an entire album from my ""liked playlist"". I now have to remove each song one by one. How is that an improvement Spotify?!"
"(premium) play pause doesnt work with headphone buttons 😑 update: while playing on Google home, even when its instructed to pause/stop, it starts playing randomly. after playlist ends, its supposed to shuffle."
"A horrible mobile app, the ui constantly fails to load even with a strong Internet connection, just leaves an indeterminate loading wheel forever. The notification controls are also slow to respond, taking an awkward few seconds to pause if you need your music to stop in a hurry. That being said the reason its so frustrating is because its a fantastic service when it runs correctly, its just so unstable."
"What have you done Spotify...ruining the best music service with the last update...Is it because you have too many bored employees and you need to find tasks for them? or the ""new wave thinking"" of ""the need to change even if something works great""?? Look at the review statistics since the last update...Do you really want to lose your users? Who love you, who built their music library with you through the years...I really wonder what was the logic behind that...BRING BACK THE SONGS TAB!!!"
Latest update that changed the UI sucks for mobile. It's slow and clunky. Changing the order of albums by download is more of a hinderance than the old purely alphabetical way.
don't bother getting this app unless you wanna waste 15$ a month. The free version is intentionally designed to be the most frustrating and painful experience in order to groom you into buying premium. My advice is to pirate the music you like and then support your artists any way you see fit.
since update it has been totally useless on both of my phones. cannot even get app to work most time have tried to delete re install and update again everything . Spotify was always my go to for music and I used it 4-12 hours a day . Now I wouldn't recommend it at all . please either solve the issue or I will be required to cancel my account thanks
"revert it back to previous ui. i can no longer sort by artists, i dont see the point of making a change like this other than forcing us to find other music to listen to."
this new update is trash. all the songs i had saved to my library are now in one folder with no means to quickly navigate. trying to patiently wait out the update the fixes it before i cancel and delete
"i give it a one star is because when i play my songs it stops and i have to click the pause button again for it to play, then it starts over. its super annoying, and offline mode isn't working, when my phone turns off so does the music."
I hate this now! ok first of all I used to love spotify and when I moved away from my friends we listen to see you again to remember our friendship BUT NO YOU DISEIDE TO MAKE THIS UPDATE YOU RUINED THE APP NOW I HA E TO SHUFFLE PLAY TO LITSEN TO THE SONG I WANT BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK EITHER! I'm disappointed in you guys. you had a really good music app..And you blew it! fix it please!😡😡
"The newest update causes constant crashing. I've paid for premium to get uninterrupted music, and now I have to keep getting my phone out of my bag every five minutes just to restart the app. The songs don't even continue from where they left so it's a huge nuisance and I will not continue my premium subscription when it runs out."
"I have spotify premium and for me the app was decent before and functioned perfectly fine, however this new update has completely ruined the app for me. Loading speed is now abysmal (3-10 seconds loading a page of saved songs), music doesn't play often requiring me to restart the app and the artists section only shows artists you follow in alphabetical order."
"Last update screwed the whole app up. Used to be very user friendly and now is horrible. Your library is no longer alphabetical but by ""recommended"", all my downloads disappeared, it requires cellular to download and refuses to with wifi, WHICH IS THE POINT OF DOWNLOADING TO AVOID USING CELLULAR. Was listening to what I thought was my downloads all day but blew through my data instead."
"The app keeps stopping every 5 minutes. I find this really annoying. I'll reconsider continuing my premium, if that problem keeps occurring..."
"Umm where did the songs tab go, where is the shuffle play button that use to be at the top? What have you done to this application?!? Seriously I can't shuffle through all my downloaded songs anymore why would you take something like that away. I pay for this and I'm currently thinking about just canceling my subscription because of that."
"The worst update possible! Shuffle resets every time you launch the app, and also between different artists and albums. The liked songs section is very counterintuitive. No one asked for this, what was to be a good app turned into some freezing garbage. Please revert everything back to normal."
"For some strange reason it does not work using WiFi and it says than there is no connection. It only works using 4g. I uninstalled and re-installed but still nothing. Huge inconvenience considering there is a payment required every month. And the WORST of all there is no support team to chat and solve the problem. Just Garbage, I am very disappointed."
What on earth did you do? Why was the UI changed to such a horrible and inconvenient layout? I can't even scroll through my artists in order anymore. Why was it even touched? The app was fine before and now it makes me want to just uninstall and cancel my subscription in favor of tidal.
wow you guys made being able to connect to a console for premium users only? and the fact this trash only plays like ten songs even though I have over 700 in a playlist seriously? you guys are ruining people's music just because your a bunch of greedy losers. if anyone out there is thinking about using a music app don't get this one it's a waste of storage
"i love spotify and I've had it for over 5 years but since this update it's basically unusable. i keep getting blank screens everytime i try to do anything. songs stop playing randomly only to begin playing 15 minutes later after i shut off the app. literally nothing is working and just lags and won't load anything despite my phone being up to date, on working wifi and otherwise completely functioning. please fix this quickly or I'm probably going to have to switch to a different music app"
After this most recent update with the UI it has made it almost unusable. It's a terrible business quality to not listen to your users and not offer a possibility to keep the UI THAT WORKED PERFECTLY FINE AND EVERYONE WAA HAPPY WITH. Congratulations now you're losing customers and getring backlash. Such. A. Great. Job.
"last update makes songs stop in the middle of playing several times. its extremely frustrating as a premium user. I dont mind so much the UI changes, but the bugs that are bow causing the app to randomly crash and stop playing downloaded music on Wifi makes me consider ending my membership."
"Was working. Now I cannot find songs or artists. App design went to garbage. Not worth a penny. If they dont fix soon, cancelling subscription. Utter TRASH!"
latest update removed artist category with all saved artist in chronological order. basically ruined the app for me. it was easy to scroll to the artist you want when you could just scroll down to the letter you knew they would be under.
"the app won't keep playing my music. it doesn't make a difference whether I'm connected to BT, aux or just the phone speakers nor with wifi or mobile data. that and the message within the blue box asking me if I'm driving is creepy"
"Ugh this new UI is horrendous! Now it's adding multiple mystery songs to one of MY own playlists! Plus issues casting to Google home when paused, buffering on my fast home wifi and showing the wrong song info on the lock screen when playing. This is ridiculous for a paid service that worked so well until this recent update."
"theyve totally ruined the app with the last update. they seem to havr assumed everyone listens with playlists and have ignored every single other form of consuming (albums, liked artists etc). now when you go on your artists, it doesnt actually show all your artists, instead showing the tiny few that you follow and ignores the rest. this makes finding individual songs or even searching through my library (of over 3000 songs) incredibly difficult and is not user friendly at all. do not recommend."
"I love Spotify. I really do. I've been a constant premium user since 2015, but I the latest UI is a total step backwards in user experience. Come on guys. Have a ""downloads filter"" in the artists section! That's all I ask. I miss scrolling through my downloaded library, going through the songs of the artists. NOT the album. I would complain about the other backword things, but this is the most annoying. Bring back the download filter of artists!"
"Backward step. Why in 'your library' would you make the artist list random. Can't easily find my favourite artists now. And albeit now on the home screen, the recently played list is really short which makes it difficult to find my recently played albums as the the list is really too small. You've made it more difficult. And more issues. Recently played isn't available offline so in my car I can't access recently played albums. Absolutely ruined the app for ease of use."
"really enjoy spotify service but newest update ruined the experience for me. I dont make playlists, I will listen to music all on shuffle or look through and aritists catalog to find what i want. The most recent update changes that and now your library only consists of playlists. Doubtful if ill renew my subscription, they've essentially turned themselves into Pandora."
"Two days ago, the app just stopped and now after many reinstalls it still keeps crashing. I am ready to cancel my account now. Fix the bugs, please and quickly."
app is complete trash. barely responsive and the ui is constantly being made less intuitive and more of a pain to navigate. I've been paying for this for five years and I'm done because the app is constantly being downgraded. totally unusable on a slow phone and it's nothing but menus. how.
The update to album/artist layout has ruined this app. The entire artist layout is jumbled up regardless of you adding artist to library. If it's not changed I will switch to different service. It's unpractical and essentially making it impossible to scan through your songs to see what your in the mood for. Ridiculous 😠
"Honestly I'm not even sure how you managed to bollock up such an amazing app, but you did it. Bravo lads. The latest update to the UI and everything else just plain sucks. It succs. Spotify now puts the succ in successful."
"You idiots destroyed the artist page with your last update, please revert to the previous version. My artists arent ordered anymore. Now I can't scroll down my artists and select one and listen to their music. Now I must search for an artist to listen to all their music and it can't be only the selected tracks of them. If this isn't fixed in a month I'm permanently moving to apple music. To everyone who reads this, don't download or subscribe to this service, you will only be frustrated.UX is bad"
Absolute trash after removing option of thumbs up and thumbs down from radio. I have my own taste in music. I don't need your taste crammed down my throat! Will be cancelling premium service shortly if not rectified. Quit trying to fix what isn't broken. And listen to your subscribers!
"this is such a backwards update from what they were. i don't like this new UI update, and when I go to Library, All i see are my Playlists. Bring back the option for us to view ""Recentlu Played"". the app was just fine before this mess! There are people like me who pay to use your app! i wish I could give this 0 stars."
"Damnit Spotify! quit screwing up the ecosystem ! in the latest update on Spotify alot of my songs either work or don't work. i swear! it happens every freakin' time whenever it's a road trip. not using Data to listen songs, i had to uninstall Spotify then reinstall it to get all my songs working again. i tried to ""Delete"" my songs but it kept those songs with that Green icon download symbol, i feel like I'm wasting $130 a year for this Beta feeling application."
"I hate the new UI!!! change it back! my library should have these links: playlists artists songs albums the only thing that's right, is the search bar in my library"
"The new update ruined this app. if my phone is locked, the app pauses after each song. i have to unlock my phone just to get the next song to play. its annoying as the majority of time listening my phone is locked. this is a major issue and burden and will be forcing me to use another service."
"The new UI is terrible, you cant view recently played anywhere logical, its now a real burden, the interface change is great, but not needed, what ""IS"" needed, is the fact that extreme audio quality is also missing, however thr recently played now gone when yku click My Library, is a real serious issue, im gking back a version however people that arent eooted or unlocked wont be able to, whos bright idea was it to take away recently playedist under my library tab? thats ridiculous!!!!"
"New update is very slow and will not show artists and albums sometimes which forces me to restart the app. Before the update, the app was perfect and things loaded quick and easy."
"Disappointed, this update always resets to non-shuffle when I play the songs from my all songs list. I usually shuffle all my saved songs and previoisly had no problem in letting the app automatically shuffle them. Now I have to go into the player screen and press the shuffle button every time I left the app. I t even resets when I switched back from watching YouTube videos. Please fix!"
"This app is good in terms of high quality songs. I made an account on it and was listening to my favourite songs. After some days, when I again opened the app, it took me back to the login page. I again made an account and then after about five days later, it took me back to the login page. Making an account takes quite long. Please fix this problem."
"Extremely poor after the last major update. Confusing and annoying UI/system changes, and everything runs so much more slowly and badly than before. Many albums became unsaved, only to be recommended back to me (had to go through and re-save them). Saved album list wouldn't even initially load without an internet connection. Total backwards step."
"Latest update ruined it, it is horrible. I can't find songs in alphabetical order anymore, finding artists is a pain now from my downloaded music. Overall, whoever thought this new update UI update is good, should maaaaybe be reevaluated, sorry."
change the design back!! recently played is in the wrong spot and i want a full list not half. i dont hse spotify for playlists so i dont want it wasting space where id like to have what i used to have.
"Latest update (June 2019) ruined the app for me. You want people to use playlists? Sure, just give me the number of songs in each playlist! I already usted playlists too! It's stable, but it worked so well before. You know what? At this point, just go back. Can't really recommend the app in this state."
The recent changes to the Your Library section are annoying and unintuitive. Your liked songs are now saved onto a seperate playlist which means you can no longer sort your library by artists unless you are following the artists.
"The latest update ruined the app. They removed the quick settings offline toggle tile. You can no longer browse your music by artist, only by album, and filtering by downloads is much worse. huge step in the wrong direction. I will be cancelling if this isn't fixed."
"Loved this app until the most recent update. Now the UI is terrible, I can't filter by downloaded only, and the whole thing runs so slow that I'm questioning canceling my subscription."
Spotify used to be a great app before the update that happened before June 22nd. They have now removed the simple and easy to use library system and have made it a chore to listen to any/all of my songs. This is a step backwards for the user experience. Ill be canceling my subscription and use YouTube Red (yuck) for the mean time.
The new interface is horrid. The artists-list and other lists aren't shown as tidy as before. You can't sort the artists in an alphabetical order anymore unless you follow them all. I use this app every day and I'm really disappointed with this design choice.
The new UI update has made Spotify unusable. It is difficult to find music that you had previously downloaded. You have to manually go through your Playlist and Like the artists to show any semblance of an artist view. Seriously considering Amazon Music or Google Music
last update ruined it. always just went to songs and hit shuffle. now i have to make playlists ir listen to specific artists. just want to be able to shuffle play all the songs i have saved.
"It's cutting out quite often (around every 5 mins) when I have my screen off (song continues when I turn my screen on again) and for some reason downloaded songs get deleted off my phone without me telling it to do that, even though I have premium. I have a Samsung Galaxy S10 if that might help. If this continues I'm looking for another music app because this is getting downright stupid."
"I've been loving this app for years but this new update makes me want to stop using spotify altogether... Why change a perfectly user-friendly interface where you can easily find all the artists and their albums neatly and accessibly organized is beyond me... it takes so much more time to find what I'm looking for. And this whole 'you need to follow artists' thing is quite annoying too... I'm terribly disappointed, please change it back :("
"The new ui has been up for a week and its still broken. I'm paying for a service that you were providing completely beforehand. If I don't get a refund for this month I'm going to switch to tidal and cry myself to sleep every night listening to 4:44. Pages don't display until you go back and forward at least once, there's no more easy access to recently played albums, artists and playlists, and there's new Taylor Swift music on my feed plus I have this weird rash send help"
"Latest update has removed standard features I used daily. Removed list of saved artists now only showing those you follow, requiring me to find every artist I've ever saved and select follow. Awful load times / long blank screens when selecting artists, even for artists' music you've downloaded - making the previous follow issue even worse. Album tab has larger icons and removed alphabetical scroll making looking through 100s of saved albums a chore. I love Spotify but this update is terrible."
"Absolutely terrible idea removing the primary library functions such as Artist and the quick scroll on the side. Regression in user experience, time to look at alternatives if it doesn't get changed. The change log should provide details about the updates so users can avoid updates that strip away features."
"This new UI is the least user friendly thing I have ever seen, opened the app today at a red light to throw some music on quick, and couldn't because I couldn't even find my library songs. If I go to my library I want to see my library, not my playlists and some option for artists which is only for artists you, follow. I don't use Spotify to follow artists, I use it to save music to my library, as I'm sure most people do. I won't be paying for an app with zero functionality, I'm canceling."
"The new update is absolutely atrocious. They've hidden a bunch of features and eliminated some entirely. The UI is the most unintuitive version they've had since inception. Additionally, on numerous occasions, I've had music stop or start playing for no reason. Lastly, they've somehow made the app run slower than before??? It takes like 5 seconds for each menu to load. I'm still flabbergasted at how bad this ""update"" really is. Simple solution is to go back to the previous version."
Ask me to review this app before the update I would have given it 5 stars. The update has ruined it. You can't save songs you like in an album anymore and forced to listen to things you don't want to listen to. And why would I want to listen to a playlist of my 'liked' songs which is almost 5000 songs in length?
Latest update ruined Spotify. If they don't roll back the changes I'll be finding a new service. The app is now unacceptably slow and difficult to navigate.
"I've always loved Spotify and have been a member for many, many years, but they have now lost me with this new update. It is atrocious. This ""saved"" vs ""liked"" thing is abysmal and ruins the way that I organize and listen to music on Spotify."
"The new UI experience is absolutely horrendous. Unable to find any of my music and the search options are drastically limited. They've legitimately removed features and are branding it as ""new and improved"". Do not recommend to anyone."
"After the new library UI opening albums has become terribly slow and it is slower to get to albums from home having to swipe through everything with one hand, overall my use of the app is a lot slower because the UX is worse and downloaded albums take seconds to load due to some kinda api call its down instead of loading instantly from the local database. If you wont change the UI back atleast improve your local caching performance so i can navigate throuvh my music without the massive load time"
"The latest update got rid of the library made it saved songs only , and now everytime i play a song i have to hit the shuffle button if i want it to shuffle afterwards . It doesnt stay on , so dumb"
"Could you quit changing the layout of app! Evrytime you guys update the interface, it gets worse because the settings we just got used to are now gone."
"the app was really cool until you updated it. now when i click on artists it just shows recommended artists, and even that isnt in alphabetical order. before, when you could see the artists' who you have an album saved, youd see the artists in alphabetical order. That makes sense right? So why update it? This ruined my workout 😫"
"I've always been a premium user, but the last update completely ruined the app and the way it organizes your library. You plainly cannot filter by artist anymore and the way it sorts by album is completely tiresome. It's really no fun at all to use Spotify anymore."
"This app is so bad now. They completely redesigned the UI into some trash and now I can't even click on a followed artist to see their music I've saved. Utter trash. Please, please, roll it back."
very useful. spotify premium is definitely worth the price as well. UPDATE: The new design is completely awful. Gone is the ability to sort songs by artist or album. This needs to go back.
"This new update is awful. I love spotify but it's getting worse and worse. First you take away the conveniently placed radio button, now you make it look like the free version by taking away the main interface for your account and removing the good recently played second. please fix this, it's the only thing that makes this 1 star."
"the new update has completely ruined my listening experience. you have to follow artists, can't save certain songs anymore, cant shuffle play my saved songs. basically I lost all my songs that weren't on a playlist. good job guys."
"the update that Spotify released ruined there library and ruined the app, i had switched to Spotify a while back because of the benefits i found it had over apple music, i do not see those benefits anymore: Spotify apears to lost what made it unique"
usually a 5 star experience but since the last update it is a mess. If I turn off the phone screen then the music stops and it takes forever now for the app to load and the music to start playing in the first place. Very very frustrating at the moment. Needs to be patched quick!
Nice job of ruining the easy navigable system you had going on. Premium user but not for long. Thanks for removing the remove album button and not giving me an easy alternative to do just that. Fun whilst it lasted.
new ui is garbage. who designed this horrible layout??? utter trash. permanently downgraded to an older version. once that stops working switching to Google music.
"I have loved Spotify right up until the June 2019 update that took one of the most intuitive, easy to use, quick to load interfaces and replaced it with something that lowered the spotify experience to that of what used to be the realm of inferior music services. Surely a great business model is not to lower the standard of your product, or perhaps that's what passes as innovative now days... I want the old school spotify... please..."
"Artists Tab is Unorganized. Spotify, I love the look of the new UI, but for God's sake please fix the Artists tab in my library. I just want it to be like the old UI where it's organized by alphabetical order, not by the bands I follow. It becomes a hassle to listen to the music I want when theres this hassle of following every damn artist I listen to, even if it's just one song."
What's with the new update??!! You can't even access your songs or all your artists??!! It's terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Worst idea ever Spotify. My cat could probably design an app better than the update you guys just did... and tbh my cat is kinda dumb.
Bring back the old UI. There's a stupid amount of problems with the bew UI I dont even want to get into them all. The app was perfect the way it was.
The new UI ruined the great features this app already had. They claim its an improvement but all it does is make it difficult and confusing to navigate. It's another case of pushing a new look that no one wanted or asked for.
"The recent update has ruined the experience for users. Simple standard features are now a nightmare to navigate, you have to follow every artist to get a list in alphabetical order and so far I cant see a way of removing individual songs from albums from my library. Rubbish! Bring back the previous format NOW!"
"I thought my previous 1 star rating was enough, but sadly the new update gets worse each day as I step on yet more dog s***. Somewhere around half of my extensive library has been removed, forcing me to re-save countless albums. Clearly Spotify wants us android users to quit, cuz I see no other motive to an update like this."
New UI update ruined the app. Impossible to navigate with constant loading screens even with data and wi fi turnes off. No way to access downloaded content in one place. As of writing this is a broke app
"Slow, clunky, poorly thought. since the UI change, having regular issues where my album list won't load, or i can't open song options, without needing to turn my phone data on and off again."
"Don't like the new UI. The swipe down while at the top of the list in order to show search bar for liked songs is not implemented anymore. furthermore, everytime i play a new song on my liked songs, the repeat function which was previously enabled was disabled."
"It's like they take in feedback about the app and make it the worst experience possible. Only have it again for the 3 months for 99 cents. Spotify, why do you hate your customers so much??? I just want to play my songs on shuffle and you just ruined it!"
"new UI is so bad. makes it way harder to go into offline mode quickly, and no all songs mode? thats core functionality fot a music app Gone! i love Spotify but if they dont fix these issues i might have to switch to youtube music. pushing the podcasts so hard in place of all songs will only make the music lovers leave."
"The new UI update is terrible. All the useful features are gone, and the app is slow, glitchy, and unbelievably laggy. What an awful idea. Will be unsubscribing."
"I love using spotify premium, i use it all the time while commuting to and from work. I dont love that I cant just scroll through my liked artists' songs alphabetically like I could before. Please fix this so it is easier to find what I'm looking for. Your new UI is garbage."
"[Premium user] With the new UI I feel I'd get way more freedom to listen to the music I want if I just pirate it. I didn't like the UI when it went from adding a song to your library to just liking liking it and I really hate how the ""songs"" tab has been removed. The UI was fine the way it was a year ago, easy to understand and use, made sense and worked. Found more problems!! I can't even get artist pages to work now. They either freeze up the app or it just loaded the name."
will be cancelling my premium subscription. I like to play all my 7000+ songs on shuffle but now they have updated the ui I only have 2500 'liked' songs in my playlist and no easy way of now liking the 4500 other songs. Losing the all songs list has basically killed the usefulness of spotify! also now not working properly with my car audio! please for the love of god change it back to the old setup. why they have thought this version is better is beyond me!!
"after each update Spotify works slower and slower. New UI response time is also slow, long loading times for artists and albums list."
This new UI is terrible. Please give us the option to organize our library the way we want. Not having artists in alphabetical order is really making this app unbearable to use.
Newly updated UI has very inefficient app navigation and a lot of functionality loss. Considering unsubscribing just cause it got so annoying to use.
"Recent update has a terrible User Interface. No longer has ability to play all songs in library. I don't want to ""follow"" or ""like"" for tracks to be added to one very large playlist. The latest update also appears quite laggy and has issues resuming play after pause or lock screen."
"What the hell, since the new update, spotify is horrible, impossible to find a song in the ""liked song"" playlist, because you removed the search engine! Paying 15$ a month for this new sh***, that's quite sad! Spotify was working well before, why change everything? Please get a new update to remove this horrible interface, because if it stay like this, I'm gonna pay Deezer, could be a better option"
Why does the player minimizes whenever I come back to app that is running in the background? Beyond stupid and not intuitive. If I want change song I have to tap few more times. Also my all liked songs vanished after upgrading to premium. Of course no refunds.
"Worst update ever. Return ""downloaded"" filter. I have hundreds of artists, I download playlists or albums just for few of them. With last update I see the huge list of all artists and i have no idea which of them are downloaded. Also i can't see if particular album is downloaded without tapping into it. You should seriously rethink UX patterns because app become worse with every update."
"One star for the sole reason that for a free account, i was forced to change my loaction on an international travel. I don't quite know why an app needs to know that, if there's no payment or censorship involved. And i will have to change it again once i travel back home. Not to add that everyone can and does track evrryone using GPS (explained by the auto suggestion when selecting location).. massively and truly Idiotic."
"Please resolve this issue of showing ad for premium subscription. It is so annoying. I just cant play songs from another album. Whenever i press the back button it shows ad for premium subscription, if i dismiss it brings me back to the same page of previous song, this goes in loop."
"This new UI sucks so much. Apparently i have to follow any artist that i want to have in my library now, otherwise they are just recommended to me to follow, and in no clear order at that. I can only see them alphabetized if I follow them? Hard pass. A major downgrade from the previous version."
The new update is terrible. Spotify has tried to make their UI simple but in doing so have made it much worse. The liked songs playlist idea is garbage and does not leave songs set to shuffle like it used too. Having to follow artists or add entire albums is a terrible choice. Please revert it back
"New update is awful. Can't sort artists alphabetically unless you follow them, which would require me to hit follow on hundreds of artists. Why try to fix something that isn't broken? I will uninstall and cancel membership if this is not reversed. Google music is looking pretty good."
The New UI Is Awful. The sorting options dont work. this is a mobile library not a playlist. the fact all the artists are listed in some randomly generated order makes my brain hurt.
"Spotify, please just undo this recent update. All my artists, songs, and albums used to be organized in alphabetical order, and the UI was easy to navigate. Now it's all a jumbled mess and it takes ages to load any selection I choose."
"On a paying plan for the family, but the new changes have not been nice to how I use spotify. I dislike everything about the new redesign, and will be probably rolling back until they make some obvious adjustments to help actual user use."
Right now spotify's UI doesn't allow for you to navigate all your downloaded songs/artist without going through a long procedure. (Spotify please fix this)
"Man I wish they hadn't updated it. Used to be great, but the new UI almost seems like it's intentionally made to make saved music hard to find. Lost a customer"
the new update ruined the app. PLEASE change it back. I want to see all the artists whose music I've saved. The way I have to be following them now it's much worse.
"Like many others have said this new update has ruined the app for me, not only is the 'your library' section layout nonsensical but the app is now incredibly slow and buggy. Every second page or section I try to load just loads a blank black page no matter how long I leave it and songs are stopping and breaking up despite the fact that I'm on strong wifi. Why the app was updated I don't know, there was nothing wrong with it before. How anyone thought the new layout made more sense is beyond me."
"Listen, I love Spotify, but this new update is terrible. Why did you change the layout? It doesn't add any useful qualities to the app at all and just ruined my saved library. Where are my partially saved albums??? Please revert back to the original layout because I love my music and now it's stressful to find what I want to listen to."
"The latest update is terrible! The new UI and library view is just useless and makes no sense, also makes navigation very hard. Still having the connection issues - regardless of the network I can't access my already downloaded music. At the rate that this service is degrading you should really consider making it free to keep users... I'm really disappointed :("
"everything was great until the previous update were the UI was changed. I cant find any of my daily mixes, my saved music is now a clumped up mess. really considering dropping my spotify premium account."
The new update is a huge step backwards. I used to love to be able to easily access all my saved music but the new UI makes it very difficult to view my favourite artists and albums. What's the point in trying to fix something that doesn't need fixing? The app has always had various bugs but i've been willing to put up with it up to now. I'll likely look elsewhere for music streaming if this issue is not resolved soon.
"They recently removed the songs tab, so I can't even go to my entire song library. If I want to play a song I recently downloaded, I'd have to go to find the artist or the album and then play it from there. A really unintuitive feature."
"The new update ruins the experience when using the app quite strongly by removing the option to look at the music you have downloaded or saved from an artist specifically and forces you to follow them to add them to the alphabetically sorted list of artists. Should the UI be reverted to its former state, the app would regain a lot of sadly lost usability for my style of using it."
"are you guys mentally challenged ?! who the f*** came up with this update, approved and implemented it ?! what have you done to the library ?! why can't I have my libaray sorted by Artists alphabetically ?! why can't I have Artists, then Albums and then Songs ?! you made navigation through the library absolutely horrible ! if you don't change this soon, I'll quit my membership and change to a competent platform."
"I used to love the app, but for some reason it auto-updated and now I have a UI that is impossible to navigate. I want my recently played music back."
"The new UI is absolutely terrible and the Spotify team has not responded to any of the never-ending negative feedback, and instead continues to push changes nobody wants. My recently played is ruined, most of my artists have been removed from my library. I am starting a 3 month trial for Apple Music, which I will switch to if you guys don't get your act together."
the lastest update ruins the app. I cannot not easily find my songs anymore which is the entire point of this app. It clearly shows how little Spotify understand their users. My saved songs are no longer listed separately and this makes it very difficult to find the songs i want quickly. please make this an option again.
"Let's just pretend that never happened = My views on the newest update, the UI looks like utter garbage, just looks so un organised and gives me ptsd to not having premium; when I open the app it freezes for about 10 seconds meaning I have to listen to some horrible song (that they've most likely 'rEcOmMeNdEd') for an extra 20 seconds when all I wanna do is SKIP SKIP SKIP IT. Also no longer lets my Bluetooth headphones skip using the skip button on them?"
The last update has ruined the app because now none of my saved songs or stations are on it. Looks like I'll be switching to a different streaming service.
"The new update SUCKS. Why on Earth would you take away alphabetical order for all artists, albums, and songs? I don't want to spend an entire day following or downloading songs I already had in my library and built up over years, and I don't want to scroll for eternity looking for a particular artist in a jumbled list of artists. Someone needs to get fired for this idea."
"They completely ruined the library feature in the new update. I shouldn't have to ""follow"" an artist to have the songs I've SAVED appear in my library. Huge step in the wrong direction"
"The latest update is really terrible. The UI is so bad that it doesnt let you see the artists you liked except only if you specifically followed them. Also, the songs take forever to load even if its in offline mode and the song is already downloaded. Plus there is no download sign in the artist tab now. This update is the worst."
"The new UI is just terrible. Please revert to the old so I can see the artists of my saved (now ""liked"") songs in the artist list (in alphabetical order, just like before). This is just not usable. I am not going to follow 100+ artists. UI designers and QA team failed here big time!"
without fail...two songs followed by six commercials...wow. It's like when facebook ruined their video platform by putting a commercial right in the middle of a song or funny video...just ruins the experience.
"i love spotify but this most recent UI change is absolutely terrible. changes around the order of my playlists all the time and added an irremovable ""liked songs"" playlist that i really dont want"
It was a great app up until they removed the feature that allowed you to shuffle your whole library of songs. It now forces you to create a playlist if you wish to shuffle music. This is a terrible design decision. Why remove features? Thinking I should switch back to Amazon music :(.
This new UI update is completely horrible. Everything is hard to navigate and you can't access anything but full albums and playlists in any reasonable way.
The app is almost unusable unless it has a very strong internet connection. screens fail to load properly even when accessing offline content. The library screen is also gone making knowing what you have downloaded a nightmare. The app is now just 3 different designs of the same music randomiser.
New layout sucks can't find any songs I've saved. only the last few are available. terrible. go back to the previous UI
"This new UI is absolute garbage. Bring back alphabetical libraries or I will without a shadow of a doubt make sure my money ends up going elsewhere for the convenience of listening to the music I want to listen to. I know what I want, and I don't need an algorithm to sort things for me."
"I used to love Spotify but the new update sux. It's taken away the song tabs & some songs I used to be able to play are now unplayable. Also I like playing all my songs on random, not just genre or artist. I'd rather it the way it was!! Please fix the problem else I will no longer be paying for Premium that is anything but."
the new update is terrible they have got rid of the discover weekly and weekly release playlists. The app has been ruined I will be looking at alternative apps for music streaming
the new design is horrible. the artist section cant be sorted alphabetically and selecting a song from my library turns it off shuffle by default. this is the worst update and makes the user experience worse.
"Had Spotify for years and loved it. this new UI is awful. i cant even sort artists alphabetically now! if this isnt fixed asap, i will be switching to another service!"
"Newest update is trash and I hope the dev's read these. What halfwit thought ""Hey, let's ruin the perfectly organized library and make users forget what they had saved?"" last thing I want is to search through 2,000+ songs/100+ artists I had saved for the one I wanted to hear. Formerly 10/10 would recommend. Now 1/10."
"A completely BS and broken app where the UI changes every 7 mins without reason and usually for the worse. It's almost like Apple run Spotify, or at least I thought so, because they're the only company on this planet that can be this asinine. I guess Spotify can now also be added to this highly exclusive list. Just stick to Spotify free on the web player, refresh when an audio ad comes and use ad block to remove the page spam."
"Spotify is, in general, a great platform, but the new UI runs the experience. The fact that albums in the ""albums"" are only shown if I save the entire album is an infuriating change - if I enjoy only listening to half an album, I shouldn't be penalised for that by spotify by making it hard for me to see the album in my library. Searching by individual song is a wholly inadequate substitute. Please bring back the old UI."
Since the IU has been updated it app sucks. No I have to follow artists to even see them in my library alphabetically and the overall design sucks. Fells like whoever did the redesign never tried it or even asked what we wanted 👎👎
"The new UI is very annoying. I used to always go to all songs and shuffle so I can listen to all the stuff I like, I can't do that anymore, also can download all my music locally now because of it. Am looking at competitors like YouTube and tidal now."
"Never reviewed any app or anything ever. Idea seemed daunting and an unnecessary faff - spotify's latest update was compelling. I love spotify, love music, love the ease of exploration. However, the new update is absolute shiticulous asspellets, boo boo, gushy gushy, sweet sassy mollasy, butt puddin. Please CHANGE IT BACK thank you. Oh and the whole leaving a review is actually quite easy... 💅 who'd have thought it!"
"June 11th update is total trash, not sure which muppet signed off on this update but they should be fired. If you're going to make a massive change like this at least give ypur users the ability to roll back the update or choose which ui style they prefer."
The newest update is awful. Several artists and albums that are saved in my library don't appear. Playlists are now a primary option when viewing your own music. Alphabetical divisions when searching through albums is now removed so it endless scrolling with no quick scroll option. Slow overall navigation of the app with no option s to convert back from this update.
the new interface is atrocious. who thought itd be a good idea to take out the all songs tab and make it into a playlist?!! also what happened to alphabetical order? now i have to go through a 3000 song playlist to find where they randomely put the one song i actually wanna listen to!! this needs to be fixed ASAP or better yet just change back to the old UI
"The new UI update is complete and utter garbage. The biggest step backwards for this app since I've had an account. Please bring back the old UI, I haven't seen a single person that doesn't absolutely hate it."
"Latest update is a mess, removing basic features like the list of all songs and making the library a lot clumsier and less intuitive to navigate. please give us the option to roll back to the classic style, or at least reinstate the 'Songs' tab?"
"used to love the app until the update, now the new UI is horrible! doesn't show a list of recently played albums, artists and songs anymore"
the new UI update is terrible to say the least. whoever decided that I no longer want to be able to scroll through my music like I can on pretty much every other paid music platform is damn stupid. But its okay because now I have a playlist of all my saved music because I love listening to post-hardcore and trap music at the same time duh /s
"UI is awful. They took a simple library and turned into some permanent car-mode garbage. I'd never felt compelled to leave a review, or stop giving you my money every month, but here we are. Currently looking for my Napster login."
"Latest updayw broke the UI. You can no longer save or unsave individual songs. This as well as other changes has completely destroyed people's libraries. It's ruining the listening experience. Spotify is downloading all the songs that youve specifically unsaved from the album, wasting your data and maxing out storage on your phone, making your phone unusable. You cant take oictures anymore if Spotify fills your phone with songs you dont want to have downloaded."
"went for a 5 star to a 1 in one update. biggest issue is the removal of the recently played tab under ""your library"". It is also less intuitive to locate all of your songs outside of your playlists. really disappointed with the new app, just wind back the clock a bit and keep it the same"
"This is the first time I've written a review but the new UI is so atrocious Why do you need to specifically 'follow' artists to have them show up? Why have they gotten rid of the recently played section? This is so user unfriendly that it borders on parody, for users that save multiple albums per artist having to scroll through all saved albums instead of the artists is very inconvenient. And since spotify put the stupid limit on saved records people use the recents to remind them of records"
"The new UI is horrible. Most albums for liked songs do not show up. Looking up songs is a pain in the ass, you must go to the liked song playlist the go to the top right dropdown menu and then search for a song. What garbage is this? Please fix this!!!"
"5 stars to 1 star because of the new update. New UI is horrible and moving away from a library to 'likes' is completely garbage. I went looking for the older version, and found it. You have to go back to 8.4.x to get the old UI, in case anyone else wants to follow suit."
"Just stop 'improving' the app. You disabled landscape mode on the now playing screen. Why FFS! And the new UI is awful as everyone else has said. Perhaps it's time to launch ""Spotify Classic"" and we can have an app that just works and plays music?"
"Once they fix this ""new and improved UI"" back to how it was this will go up. Used too my artist section was nice and in order. now its a random mess. Why would you change this. There was nothing wrong with the old UI and the new one damn sure isnt faster. Change it back!!!"
absolutely hate the new design. the old one was much better. searching is difficult. more annoying ui to get to my saved music. it's a really bad ui design. i don't know why they would change it when it was already much better than this version. please give us the option to switch back to the better ui. the mucic is still good though.
"I don't like the new UI. I preferred having access to the songs I chose to download, I hate how I have to go through the app now, it's tedious and almost not worth using."
"I really liked the spotify app untill last major update. The UI for ""library"" looks absolutely horrendous and is not at all an improvement. The library has become such an unuseful mess. Just bring back the ""saved"" systen and not this dumb ""liked"" system. Please Spotify listen to your users."
"Im seeing other people say that the new UI is terrible so i refuse to update. roll it back, spotify. otherwise im switching to a different provider after years of using spotify"
"I hope you can go back the design. this new one is so bad, I can't play an specific artist, my downloads went wrong and the likes don't match to the album :c"
Quite disappointed in the new update that was released. Can't find the music I enjoy listening to and this new layout makes it so much harder to enjoy. Very frustrated and am beginning to look at other options as this is not a step forward or in the right direction. Please fix this ASAP
"it was good. then they changed the ui so now i can't find the artists because it's in some stupid ""recommend artists order"". as well as this I can't see just the songs that I've downloaded from a specific album, i have to look at the entire album. please just change it back"
"Didn't want to have to give this app such a low rating but the latest update is horrible. The UI is attrocious, there was no reason to update from the previous one. It wasn't broken, so why fix it? Listen to your consumers, Spotify. Just go back to the previous update please."
"New UI update is absolutely garbage - extremely inconvenient and a waste of an update. Unless it's been changed since this review, find another music platform. Dropped my subscription after 3 years."
"Hey, why you won't stop releasing updates? Each update brings just new screwup... Awesome new UI somehow do not recognize downloaded songs and I have only black screen when click to artist, only way is to remove download and listen online... and please do not say that your team is working o resolution, I found two years old posts on internet where people complain about it, so either you don't care as long as people are paying or you should really think about replacing your developers."
Undo this awful UI update! The follow feature never worked for me but now I'm forced to follow every artist just so that their songs appear with all the rest of my library. Who thought that was a good idea? You screwed up a simple sort feature! I'll be ending my subscription very soon if this isn't fixed
The new UI is horrible. Liked songs have been put into a playlist and my Artists have gone. I've tried to add some but they just wont load. Good luck if you're trying to find a downloaded song or artist offline. I will be cancelling my subscription that i have had for over 5 years next week if the user interface is not changed.
"New UI is awful. Everything just feels more convoluted and confusing to navigate compared to the old UI, please revert this back."
I'm normally not the reviewing type but that last ui update makes me want to buy all my albums and unsubscribe. It's hot garbage. Literally no one asked for this. We need the recently played section back in Your Library. Every was fine before and if the app just went back it would be 5 stars.
"why does the new ui update remove the ability to only download and save parts of albums? that was one of the features i used most in the app, as many albums either have remixes, or songs i dont like on them, and i would unlike them so they didnt play when i was playing from the saved artists section. this update forces you to make playlists for every artist just so you can choose what songs you want to listen to. no one asked for this, this is a step backwards and removes value from premium."
"Dear developers, please undo this last UI-Update. Most of the users like the old UI and you changed it for no reason. I simply heared my songs without playlists. Please make the step backwards. Thank you"
Terrible new update. Cannot believe there is no search bar at the top of your 'liked songs' like in the old app. I now have to press more buttons to do the same thing! Also why is all your saved songs in the same menu as a bunch of playlists I never listen to anymore?
"New UI is absolutely horrible, not user friendly and a massive step backwards. If you haven't saved the whole album then it doesn't even show up, what the hell? Please spend less time telling me what I should be listening to, and just let me listen to my music. Anyone considering going premium: don't."
"last update used on June 19th crashed the app, my phone and my memory card. Design is also terrible. Great job! Time to rethink your developers team. where is your lead???? If you are a new user don't waste your time with it!"
Spotify please listen to your customers and stop removing features we love. you guys removed the ability to save only the song i like in an album. why am i forced to save the whole album? why do i have to follow an artist before they can appear in my artist page? you are a music streaming app not a social media app. i find myself installing old version of your app from last year cause your updates are just not it. the queue. can pressing the 'previous' button actually go to the previous song.
"Spotify itself is a great place for those speaking music and podcasts. Nevertheless, their last update has turned their app into an unusable mess - uninguitive and uncomfortable to use and simply ugly. I hope they would correct the issue and patch up the app so it works great again"
"you guys just ruined this app by screwing with the artists page. i have premium and 1,800+ songs saved and now I have to either follow every single artist or look them up if I want easy access to the songs i like. It was the best music app by far but this UI update ruined it for me."
The new UI combined with Spotify's complete lack of response to the thousands and thousands of complaints it has received from paid users made me cancel my premium subscription months ago and move over to Apple Music. It shows great arrogance to sit in silence while a multitude of customers complain they no longer like what they are paying YOU for.
"Since the last update, it will spontaneously just stop playing music and require being restarted. very disruptive and annoying. galaxy S10."
The newest UI update has ruined the user experience completely and i will be ending my long standing subscription as it should not be this difficult to find the music I saved. It has just put 2400 saved songs into a playlist and to filter on albums only works if you have the full album saved as otherwise it does not show up and also for artists it does not show any unless you follow them and I am not manually going back through my library to follow all the artists I have. Change it back !!!!!
"I used to love Spotify and use it as my primary music player, but the recent interface update (June 2019) has ruined an otherwise excellent app. Music library navigation is now confusing and awkward - with saved albums separated from individual saved songs, interface icons/text and album art made too large, and numerous other small issues. I wish I could revert to the previous app version, but it looks like I will have to look for a different music app instead."
was good until this last update. ruined everything I cant find anything not even my profile. then downloaded all my songs over 4g rather than wifi like I put it as! used all my data... also only plays half a song then stops. after this month I'll be leaving spotify.
"genuinely dont get it... before i had to reformat my phone i had a section (where it said artists and songs) thats now gone. and from what ive read on forums i have to now organise my hundreds of albums into one folder to play all songs on shuffle. was originally a 4 star app but for my personal use this has made it unusable :( also i have to delete things in the queue one by one? a ""select all"" function would solve both of these. just seems like a basic feature that should be included"
"Terrivle UI update. Hard to find playlists, artists, settings.. Seriously, how is offline mode more easy to toggle? We're all in and out of wifi so often that it's so annoying to go into the settings each time. not only did i uninstall, I unsubscribed a family plan and switched to YouTube Music. Recommended the same for all.. or Apple Music."
"Offline Playback is buggy with external storage and it's Spotify at fault - because Tidal and Deezer both work flawlessly with the same MicroSD. No way to pause sync and stream (!?) - you're either offline or online - which sucks on public hotspots. The UI is awful, unintuitive, mildly sluggish and worse than it used to be; it combines favourites and saved albums. In general, a headache. I'd say go for Deezer, its not perfect but its better. Spotify probably won't get their app game sorted."
awful ui updates. stop changing things for the sake of change. its IMPOSSIBLE to find platlists to add songs to in the newest version. border line ready to jump ship to another service.
I really hate the new UI. I've been a premium user for 4 years and the new update took away the option of listening to all the songs I've downloaded. Please bring back the old UI
"Latest update ruins it. Bring back the proper library, alphabetically listed artists of downloaded songs, etc. My ""Favourited""/""Liked""/Downloaded(!!) Musik ist not supposed to be a stupid Playlist, but my Library itself. And my library is not supposed to consist of ""liked""/""followed"" artist accounts. My music library is not bloody social media. Please revert ASAP!!"
"The new update is garbage. Makes navigating your library of saved songs unnecessarily convoluted and unintuitive. Not sure exactly what the ""improvement"" is supposed to be since the search and discover functions already worked fine without inserting them in place of my list of saved artists."
"Spotify, you can't be serious with this update. You built yourselves as a replacement for buying libraries of music so I understand needing to make your margins. But now i assume you're selling ""follows"" to the artists who sign with you and you made me rebuild my library as a result? Your devs could have done this without that effect I'd imagine. For what it's worth, this is the kind of capitalization that will push people back to pirating music."
"New UI is horrible. Difficult to find saved artists/songs, takes long to load songs (3-5 second delay after selecting an artist or album), overall bad update - more problems than before, and there were already a few. Not a fan, need to find a more functionable, user friendly streaming service. Two thumbs down on the update."
"The recent UI update made it a lot more difficult to use what were once easily accessible features. You can no longer easily remove songs from your playlists, or easily search/filter songs within your library. These features were both must haves for me"
the new update and absolutely garbage. it has ruined my library of music so i have to search for artists and follow them instead it having them alphabetically saved. FIX NOW!!!!
"latest update isnt great - instead of focusing on performance issues including connectivity and songs not playing, it 'fixes' the UI by making it slower and making the songs section much less conspicuous, placing it amongst playlists. i also can't search through downloaded songs only anymore. which i could change back"
"The latest update deleted thousands of songs I'd saved over many years from my library and removed the ability to show only downloaded content, which I always used to save data while not on wifi. It seems to be designed to increase podcast exposure but it's less user friendly. Poor form Spotify!"
Changed it from 5 stars to 1 due to the recent mess of a UI update. Did this seriously make it all the way to users without ONE person questioning whether or not this was a good idea? An absolutely brilliant app ruined. I'll change this back if this is ever fixed or cancelling my premium account and finding another music app if it doesn't.
New UI is a disgrace. I can't find songs I've downloaded or have my artist list sorted by A-Z. it's all done by the like system or recents so they can try and improve their recommendation system rubbish. you are actively removing good functionality from a product that is a market leader likely to drive metrics instead of usability. bad job guys.
The new UI is a step backwards. It looks nice but it ist not very useful. The most important thing I'm missing is the music history. If I won't get back my history I'll consider chnage to an alternative music provider. I'm a subscriber for many years.
"The new UI makes it very difficult to locate the artists that I want to listen to in my library. They used to be organized by alphabet, but now they're listed randomy with no way to organize them. Hoping they'll fix this, it makes the app very annoying to use."
Absolutely love Spotify but I HATE the new UI. It seems everything is organized primarily with playlists now and I am not a fan. Please revert back the last one.
The recent update was a step backward. The ability to see how many songs a playlist has is gone. Sorting alphabetically was also removed. Searching through liked songs is harder. The design and organization is also worse. Nothing but bad things to say about it.
"The new UI makes it incredibly difficult to see what artists you have in your library unless you ""follow"" them. I have over 9k songs, I don't have time to add them all manually"
"put it all back, just put it back. everything was great until you messed it all up. will give 5 stars when you give me back the old UI. Otherwise I'm gonna start looking at other options for music streaming."
"The new interface that they implemented is nothing short of a complete design failure. It only proves to be a hindrance and a pain in the behind to work with. The only thing Spotify has going for it right now is the fact that it plays music. Aside from that, if this app won't revert it's UI, I'm leaving for good. I've been a patron and premium user for quite some time now. This so far has been the worst thing ever. Don't pay at all for this dumpster of an app."
"Really ? How tereible is that new update. We lost the list of recent songs, adequate space for spotify radio, all song list... And still, I just opened the app for two minutes. Could we have a UI choices ? By choosing our favorite sorting or something."
"This new update really ruined this app for me. Do i really have to follow every artist that i liked 1 song from, that was found on a playlist and liked, just for them to appear in my downloaded music properly. The best of playlist were the ease of adding songs to your Library on a whim, and the best part of Spotify was the unique playlists."
i absolutely loath the new playlist page. i now have to individually search for everything i want to listen to because there is no recently played page that i can quickly and easily find what i want to listen to. worst update ever.
The UI from the previous update is better. The new one does not really help people navigate through different artists easily.
bring back the drop down recently played. make it a tab on music if you have to. swiping to the right is so messy and unintuitive!
"The last update is terrible. Now, instead of featuring my saved songs in the albums section, Spotify expects me to find what I want quickly among 9000+ songs in a SINGLE playlist with no criteria whatsoever. What a joke. I hope they take notice and reverse this terrible interface."
The new update layout is extremely poor in design as I can no longer see all the recent albums or song I have played in the library. Along with this my saved songs are all mixed up with having saved full albums not in remotely the correct order. As a premium customer I hope they fix these issues as they are frustrating to deal with
"What a mess! I used to love the layout, plain and simple to use and organised. Now it's a mess. Artists are not all there and they are not in alphabetical order. My go to was the play all songs button, now it's gone! I just hope they fix this. Was 4 stars before, now it's a 1."
"I have used Spotify for years but the UI in the latest update is terrible. I'm sure enough people have raised this issue so please, Spotify, fix it."
"the new update is horrible and made everything harder to find, organise and listen too it also deleted all my downloaded songs its so inconvenient there was nothing wrong with the previous version but i guess its just a trend to ruin good apps"
"The new UI is totally disaster. Spotify have become very slow in this update. It's take like 2min to load my playlist, another 2min to load the songs, even I already saved my playlist! Considering to unsubscribe if nothing improve."
The latest update broke a lot of my playlists and removed the ability to remove/unlike songs from saved downloaded albums. Not a big fan of the backwords UI update really confused at the intention of this update very disappointed...
The new ui makes it harder to navigate and enjoy music. no auto queue generation here anymore. no artist auto follow if you save a track. will be cancelling premium soon and going elsewhere which is a shame since I've been a member for the last five years.
"The new UI makes the app nearly impossible to use. Artist list only includes artists you've subscribed to, not ones whose music you've saved, which is a major inconvenience. The experience is more centered on playlists now, which is incredibly annoying for anyone wanting to find the music that they saved, like in a normal music library. And it's also become very slow whenever I open an artist, album, playlist, etc. I normally roll with it when an an app I like changes the UI. But this is awful."
"Infinite loading everywhere, no matter the network environment it just takes an eternity to do anything and instead of fixing that they change the UI to a terrible mess on Samsung S9 +"
the new UI (user interface) is just down right unbearable. it is no longer possible for users to navigate organise or manage this app efficiently and as a premium user and long term fan of spotify I'm really considering changing platform for my music because the recent change in the app are utter sh**. TO THE USERS WHO HAVEN'T DOWNLOADED THE RECENT UPDATE.... DONT!!! STAY WITH THE OLD VERSION
"use to be good but now it is the most useless music app yet. no search in liked library, no pause/skip button from swiping down. a very disappointing update, backwards a mile."
"Latest update has made the app very clunky and slow, also removing songs from the your library is going backwards. Prefer the old ui as you ca find your selected artists/songs easier."
"new interface is aweful and you can't op out of it. Have to open a menu to get to the search bar, shuffle, and repeat. Why add steps in between of these things. aweful UI."
The new user interface is incredibly unintuitive. I will likely be ending my premium service unless the UI is reverted or majorly improved.
"Newest UI update removes the ability to browse my songs by artist, showing them in an abitrary and random order, ultimately changing the way I would normally listen to my music. Spotify now requires you to ""follow"" artists in order to access this functionality, but has hidden all my songs and artists I previously had ""saved""."
"the brand new ui is absolute garbage. I dont understand why spotify cant just keep the same ui for very long, instead they just progressively remove usefull feature and make it an un-navigigatable mess with oversized icons."
"Free user has adds and limited options, ok, but you can't even play one song you like? The UI exasperates me, I searched a song.... You can't play it, no play button, so I ""liked"" it, found it in liked songs... You can only play 10 seconds or so, then only shuffle. But spotify adds ""suggestions"", after 6 skips, can't listen to the song. Addef it to a new playlist, can't play it more extras and shuffle. Added 14 more songs to void suggestions, still only shuffle. Never listened the song I wanted"
"New update is horrendous. The layout is awful and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I can't search by song nor by artist. Extremely poor design, I have no idea what they were thinking, but it's extremely frustrating trying to navigate and find music in the library."
"new UI is awful, and I contacted them on Twitter asking if users can change it back and got a cookie cutter answer basically telling me we're stuck with this awful update no one wanted. I'm going back to Amazon music where i can download songs to my phone and keep them and where I can actually find my music."
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Come on Spotify. Gonna head to another service now, one that doesn't change their UI when the current one is fine"
The new ui is terrible. I don't follow any artists so have nothing on the artists tab. The only way to find a song if you don't have it on a playlist is to scroll through every song you have saved. This is a terrible system and a step backward.
"New interface is counterintuitive. Playlist, Podcasts, but no library at the top? No pull-down search function? 5 seconds in and I dislike it immensely."
"New UI is absolutely trash. Taking away the song tab was the worst decision, i can't find any of my music unless it has been placed in a playlist. I'm pretty pissed about it."
"I pay for premium but my app is only showing free. tried uninstalling and reinstalling, logged out of all devices, turned off facebook connectivity and your support network is impossible to find actual help with. have been a paying customer for quite some time and I'm not sure what happened but I'm super unimpressed with not being able to just select play all frigging music"
"Literally one of the worst apps I ever used 👏👏 Not even talking about things hidden in Premium. Only use Spotify sinxe it supports the artists. UI is weird, there's no ""Shuffle"" nor ""Repeat"" button, can't choose a starting song (probs to support ""No Skip""), can't change order of songs or see what'll play next. ""Autoplay"" on even if turned off on computer (settings don't cary over? Really? Why make an account) and it shows notification if playing on another device (no reason to do that)."
The new UI is hot garbage. Finding songs and particularly artists is unintuitive now and feels clunky compared to the classic layout.
"The new ui is terrible. When you go to an album it shows all the songs in it, not the ones you saved. Do not recommend updating."
The new UI has basically ruined app. This was an awful choice. Recent listens on Your Library page is gone. Please revert back to old format as UI is awful.
"like the app, but it's very buggy lately. ising an s10+ and when listening the music pauses at random points until I turn the screen back on or hit play on my headphone button. also happens without headphone use. PLEASE fix."
Just add back in a songs and a recently played tab in your library so we can use the damn app properly again. I just convinced my family to go onto family premium and now I am going to tell them to quit because the new UI is unusable for any of us. Your library should be a damn library not just a blocky list of playlists. And please please make it vertically scrollable because I want to see as much as possible on the page when I'm selecting.
This new music UI just completely ruined my library and i can only see a fraction of the artists i had previously saved. i cant find a way to revert it back to the old and BETTER way either. after using the premium service for years if it isnt changed back i think ill have to find a new service which sucks because ive liked spotify for so long.
"Premium user for many years. the app has become slow to launch and load songs. Songs break apart all the time. The UI keeps getting worse, and it just requires more taps to do the same action. Podcasts don't properly sync with desktop. i still miss the radio nav item."
"Songs keep pausing randomly, multiple times per song unless I leave my phone unlocked and open. Maybe get your dev team to work on that rather than pointless UI changes just for the sake of change."
"So many bugs. Eats away your data in a flash. Saving the songs and the cache into the sd card requies so much work. Songs will disappear if you turned your phone off while playing a song, it WILL NOT USE your bought data from Globe, and downloading songs (not an entire album) requires a roundabout way rather than just simply clicking 1 button. Terrible terrible app. Highly not recommended"
"For some reason the latest update wants to connect with Waze... seems like a built in new feature. I need an app that plays music, not navigates."
"terrible. you can't listen to what you want when you want. there are no play buttons, skip buttons, nothing. it seems like you can actually listen to music only in a very limited shuffle. you just have to hit shuffle and let it go. ridiculous!!!"
My account got hacked and when I tried to get in touch with customer service I just get a message saying please send screenshot of payment made. Even after sending the rquired screenshot I kept teceiving the same message and my problem was not resolved. Absolute Rubbish app
"New Update, BAD CHOICES.. since this new update I purchased Spotify Premium again and i can't listen to any of my music, all my music saved into my library is now gone, not downloaded at all when I've had them all downloaded before, to follow and artist to even download their music.. that's just stupid, thinking of switching back to Apple Music, unless the update gets reverted back to the previous UI.. 😐 not happy at all."
"I'm very upset that you can't actually listen to music (unless that requires premium). I love Spotify and I always will, but that's kind of not okay."
"Look. U guys are doing amazing with this app except one thing that makes me give the 1 star so I can get ur attention. I'm on ur family plan and whenever another member on the same phone model, Sam G8+, plays music the app shows running in the background. if I go in and stop the music, the other member gets affect and I cant listen to other songs on my phone. looks like this is a common issue among many users from a quick Google search and I wonder if u guys will ever correct it."
"Offline doesn't work (the button just disappeared, tried reinstalling - 4th time doing it since about 2 months ago from all the problems), streaming doesn't work (all you get is pauses every 2 sec). Used to be something I enjoy on the way to work but now I would rather listen to the sound of the train"
Constantly stopping mid song. wakes up only after pressing a button on the phone. Hope they fix it soon because it has become useless.
"the new UI is absymically terrible, doesn't list all your saved songs but groups them only by albums or artists. What idiot came up with this? The app also frequently deletes my downloaded music, forcing me to redownload everything every other week. i will not be paying for premium for much longer unless these are fixed, but i doubt they ever will."
I'm quiting because i can't chose the song i want it adds song that i don't even want! i downloaded this because my cousin was using it and it was putting the song he wants and not any random song this app sucks. If it didn't put random songs in my playlist i would really apriciate it and give it a five star rating
"Rubbish, I don't know why so many people download it. The UI is completely, just wrong, it would be so much better if it was done in a different way, the actual songs are.... Well I couldn't tell you, BECAUSE I CAN'T LISTEN TO THEM. That's right ladies and gentlemen, they are so greedy that unless you get Premium it won't let you play the songs you want in your play list! So instead you're forced to use the, ""Shuffle,"" which plays a song at random, AND EVEN THEN after every song there are adds!"
"To keep it as short as i can DO not waste your hard earned money on this app. Spotify used to be amazing up until about February. they have Completely ruined how you listen to your saved music you CANNOT listen to your saved music by artist any more for some reason and from what i have seen they have NO plans of fixing it. i have had their premium service for years and it has been great up until this point, their community has sent many complaint s and still no news if its going to get fixed"
"Garbage app, constantly buffering, even when I have full 4G signal. I'm having to restart it constantly, and the new UI is terrible. I feel like the app used to work so much better."
"Spotify isn't downloading my music anymore I've tried clearing my cache, turning the up the download quality, turning off and on the download button EVERYTHING. I'm almost completly fed up with this. Spotify used to be one of my favorite apps, but this is how you LOSE custumers Spotify, not how you gain more."
"I'd like to ask the developers, as to why the 'Repeat button' for a song or playlist been removed from the app?? Spotify has been a good app for music purposes but ever since the repeat button has been removed it's just a total waste. There's no point in being a premium member if it doesn't have the requisite features a music player. I'm unhappy with the current situation of the app. I'll be uninstalling the app if nothing is done about it."
I am not the only one who thinks that spotify is close to unusable with the new update. the new library ui is so bad. cannot sort by recently added artist and have to follow artist in order to see them in your library? what are u guys doing?
"Every update it seems to lose important features like deleting all played podcast episodes at once (or just hide them more, but what's the purpose?) it uses more and more RAM so theres a delay in selecrting Albums for example and also just turning it into an optical version that's mot appealing at all (why keep taking away tabs and simply just make every button bigger??) Stop trying to ""improve"" things just for the sake of improving."
"The latest version turned everything into trash. You cannot search your library of liked songs with a simple swipe anymore, wich was my most used feature.U cannot swipe left or right on the song view on P20 pro as the window always seem to scroll a little down. Also i dont need a stupid ""lyrics genius"", put the real freaking lyrics or dont put anything, or at least add a DISABLE button that actually disables this and those weird videos that eat half of my mobile data.App gets downgraded evrytime"
"you can use google account to use app, but you can't cancel subscription using the same app. Support page is useless if your question doesn't fit narrow list of questions in faq and there is no option to ask a question. you have no control over your personal and payment data from the app and it is hard to find it on the web page. Poorly designed mobile app in general. So if you are not sure, that you will be able to cancel your subscription without detailed help do not download this app."
"Spotify, can you please provide a rationale behind the drastic format changes in your app? Take a look at all the recent reviews, and it won't be long until you realise you've made a mistake. No users have something positive to say about the changes. Not only did it remove artists from my library (a library which I build over years of being a faithful premium customer), but the app now contains major bugs which impede songs from being played Time to be smart and backtrack on this nonsense."
"The app used to be good. I could go to ""your library"" and click on artist or quickly access a station I had made or ""made for you"", now it's extremely frustrating to navigate through just to play what I want to hear. Please just bring back the old library."
"Latest update is absolutely horrible. Listen to your loyal subscribers Spotify, change it back. It is not intuitive, and a pain in the ass to search for downloaded songs now. I am ao frustrated every time I need to use Spotify, because it was so great before. PLEASE listen to everyone, NOBODY likes this update!"
Takes forever to open a playlist or album. Often doesn't load at all and have to kill the app. Top that off with an awful and unintuitive UI. Garbage.
I wouldn't even give it a star. But I have too in order to post a review... This App sucks I pay for the family plan and it won't even let meisten to music every time it shuts off and tells me Spotify has quit working. When only 1 device is using Spotify... Sick of it. Waste of money in my sense
I live this app but I will cancel my subscription and quit using it if it doesn't fix its latest problem ever since update music stops unless you're phone is constantly unlocked or it will stop then 30sec later go then stop etc
"No good. I am not able to log in at all. Every time I try, it quickly bounces between the loading screen and the ""main menu"" before eventually throwing me back to the login menu."
app now rendered useless. music cannot be played whilst phone is locked. i have to click my phone's sleep button to restart but only plays the song for 4 seconds before stopping again. please fix asap. samsung S10
Spotify ruined its library feature. It is now completely useless and the main way I and many of my friends use the app. Luckily a friend gave me a heads up before I updated the app. I still have the old library feature. If I'm ever forced to update I'll be moving to Google Music.
The UI for this app is terrible. Spotify is so bent on shoving premium down users' throats that they have a whole tab in the app just for convincing you to buy premium which is a tremendous waste of space for someone like me who has not interest in getting premium. It is mind boggling to me that there is no place to view a songs history in this app so if I like a song that was just played I can't go back and see what it is. Spotify deliberately handicaps non-premium users' app experience.
"Used to love Spotify, now its just tedious and so ""time consuming"" to use? Artists not listed in alphabetical order, hard to find saved artists quickly etc.. Other reviews show that so many premium customers are finding this new update frustrating for the same reasons! I have the family subscription and we're all constantly moaning about it, so now looking into other services, shame as we'll lose our playlists! (although we've lost the ability to scan saved artists easily)"
"the new UI on the mobile app is absolutely ABYSMAL. It used to be great and easy to use, but now that theyve gotten rid of the Artists tab i honestly couldnt even tell you how it works. Maybe time to switch services unless they fix this FAST, as it seems like there is not a soul on Earth that is happy with this new UI."
"the new UI is terrible, no alphabetical order, I cannot find the albums that I downloaded, the albums thst I have previously downloaded are being shown as if I have never downloaded them and I have to do it again which is thousands of them. Before this update, it was so easier to find whatever I wanted to listen to, now, It is all gone. thanks a lot for ruining one of most used platforms of PS."
this app is getting worse and less usable with every update. last victim is the top search box in the playlist. Seriously did you hired usability and ui engineers from Microsoft?
"As a premium user, the UI is the most terrible of any music app. No ability to search for songs in a playlist, no ability to view all downloaded songs and the search feature gets stuck in a permanent loading cycle if you're internet drops out for even half a second and is incapable of getting out of it without rebooting the app. These were these features previously there. The design team seems to consistently remove features with every update."
Worst app ever. I can't even create a playlist without any interference with the UI adding it's own tracks. It's just an app that doesn't cater any free users at all. Any users trying understand the app shall never purchase the app NOBODY SHOULD EVER INVEST IN THIS WORTHLESS APP.
"My spotify stops playing when the screen goes off and sometimes it takes a really long time for my playlists to load. Also, sometimes spotify doesnt sync my playlists. I have to log out and log in multiple times to overcome this. This is quite frustrating"
"New UI is awful. Can't find the saved songs for each artist have to go to a playlist with all the songs. Stupif redesign, making it a lot more difficult to use. This should never have been approved and rolled out!"
"The UI was very bad and i hate it! No need to explain cause they/ someone already said the reasons....😪 you disappoint us Spotify.. I'd like to say I prefer the preview update version😀, i hate the new model the new one🙄☹️....."
"since the last update, I have not been able to play any songs through my aux cord. I am on the family plan and paying a good amount. I've been dealing with this for 3 days now. I want compensation for the days that it's not working. I have been a paying customer for the past 2 years and I am not happy about this!"
"It was the perfect music service until they completely ruined it with the last update. Ive had spotify premium for over a year now, but if Spotify continues to be like this, it might be time for a new music service."
"This is by far the most user unfriendly app I've ever used. No soundtrack played history, the entire ui is a mess of buttons that are completely at random. Yuck."
"One simple question and I really hope its heard! why would you remove the search in playlist function and put it in a sub menu, such an unnecessary step to search a son should be quick and easy when the only thing your service offers is music streaming"
It seems like this app is getting worse with time. I can't sort my library by artists in alphabetical order now? Songs will just randomly pause for no reason? The app gets updated but every change is negative to the user experience.
"Not a music app but a social media app. Extremly user unfriendly. If you just want to listen to your music dont even bother. Everytime it updates, it gets worse. Now it has reached a point that the interface or menu is no longer usable, you cant find the song or artist you wanna play in ten minutes, who ever designed this interface ruined the whole app turned it into complete garbage. Im surprised an popular app like this can have such retarded design. Menu is complicated and 90% of it is usless."
"The app UI as well as selection of music is GARBAGE. Swipes don't work. Can't shuffle. Half my favorite artists are missing. Not even sure why daily mixes stopped working. I definitely won't renew my subscription after the free trial. But the biggest surprise is how bad Spotify is, after hearing about it for years."
"The latest update has ruined Spotify. I liked listening to random songs from all the albums/artists i had saved in my library as a way of discovering new tracks. Now i can only choose albums, artists or liked songs. some tracks stop before the end and i thought it was an issue with my phone/wifi but can see from other reviews that its happening to other subscribers. i am thinking about cancelling my premium membership as this feels like a downgrade and i would rather spend 9.99 with Amazon"
The latest UI update has ruined spotify. I've used spotify for years and my personal library had every song I've ever liked since high school. Honestly there's no point in having Spotify anymore without being able to select the songs you want from your own library. Rename the App to iHeartRadio Jr. and just call it a day.
Absolutely stupid interface. Can't turn off shuffle mode. Totally counterintuitive. Come on Spotify. it's not rocket science. I've seen on some blog advice to drill into the menus to the song that's currently playing and tap the crossed arrow icon. but I simply don't have that on my galaxy A9
awful especially if u r trying to add ur family to premium. so many issues when trying to create their account especially if theyve had a previous account. still not been resloved and the customer services is pretty rubbish as no one guides or contacts u!!! very frustrating!!!!
commercials are twice the volume of the music. i have to rush to turn it down so my equipment isnt damaged. make it the opposite and id 5 star.
"spotify does not develop software for LG devices beyond one successful launch. this is the second time ive owned an LG device in 4 years, and spotify has been completely useless and unresponsive quite frequently on both. I have factory reset my LG V40 twice to now find out that spotidy is causing my phones UI itself to freeze and crash multiple times per DAY. been a premium member since 2013, this is downright infuriating. any direct feedback sent to spotify with error data has been ignored"
Garbage!  * Inconsistent buggy UI across device platforms * Over monetised model plays more advertisements than music * Advertisements get stuck in a loop (see the dreaded 'Stuck playing same ad' bug that continues to plague users for the past 3 years) * Amateur app and service with zero support when it inevitably stops working !!!AVOID!!!
"Please implement swipe to cue songs as you have done with IOS, literally no need to not include this feature other than being paid off by apple I suspect.. I feel the quality of android UI experience is lower than that of IOS users, and while I am very happy to have gotten rid of my iPhone, I simply cant deny that Spotify was nicer to use on iPhone, sort it out please! Swipe to Cue!!!!!"
"Is it me or andriod devices only face this problem . Restart my andriod phone , and spotify cannot log in again . It prompt spotify need to go online and just stuck at blank screen . Can't do the get around method provided as i used facebook as log in . I paid premium btw and only solution seem to clear all data at app setting for spotify which all playlist will be gone. Seem to be ongoing problem for quite sometime and no fixes done to it ."
"Another uncalled for update, stick with a UI for at least a while. Also test it beforehand, the scroll bar flows over the header in the Liked 'playlist'. Finally you hid the search under a menu, not by simply swiping down like it used to be. And newly created playlists still dont show up on the list, noy even after reinstall. Come on."
Latest update ruined the entire experience! app crashes and shuts down! It keeps offering me premium features when I already have premium! I'm canceling my subscription with a lot of regret. I worked sooo hard on my playlists...ugh
"since last update, I am unable to listen to music when my phone is locked. i have to wake my phone for the music to play. also, i am unable to skip tracks using the widgets. i have to click my earphones button. please fix. other than that itll he a great app"
"Up until now I have been very happy with Spotify, but since the last update a week ago, i have been extremely disappointed and frustrated! As soon as my phone locks Spotify stops working! I listen to Spotify a lot, while I'm running, in the car and at home. But unless my phone is on constant unlock it just stops working!!! I'm paying $15 a month for a terrible product!!! Sort this problem ASAP Spotify or I am cancelling my membership and will find another music app that suits me better 😡"
"The new app design is horrific. It's super slow, clunky and has removed much of the sorting fuctionality for saved songs. My liked songs dissapear and reappear apparently at their own leasure and unsort themselves often. It's like we've gone full circle back to a beta test or something. While its like this I cannot in any way recommend purchasing premium. Use another service."
"like most other people the update on May 13 2019 completly ruined it whether it be skipping song or now they will add songs to your playlist and not let you skip them. And on at least my phone it makes me suffle I cant play on song, if im looking for a song i have to listen to a ten+ playlist which sometimes doesnt let you skip. Plz fix this, this app was amazing before this update i dont want to have to switch to a different app."
fix this app the music keeps stopping whenever my display screen goes off and then once I press my home button it starts playing again. Regardless of my data being low I'm still able to play music without it buffering before than
My account was constantly being hacked and used by someone else. Then my playlist that I had built for years started disappearing. Beyond pissed!!! Wish I would be reimbursed for the past few months...
Since the update yesterday i have this terrible UI I hate this new layout and have to search for artists i know i had saved but Spotify decided they know better and force this layout on me. it doesn't work the way i want and have enjoyed for years and i don't seem to have the option to revert back. im going to cancel unless it gets sorted. i absolutely hate this app now. At least give people the option. After all this is a product i pay for and if im unhappy i will go elsewhere.
"new update has ruined my spotify experience, library is unorganized and it's harder to find my downloaded music. seems more of a downgrade than upgrade."
"After this recent update, it's become a struggle to use the app. In general the UI is so much more clunky than it use to be, removing the recently played section is such a pain now, I now need to go through and follow every single artist I listen to otherwise they don't show up anywhere useful. The largest issue however is the fact that when I tap on an artist to open up their page one of two things happen: 1. nothing. the app freezes. 2. it takes 5-10 seconds to open. not worth the money now"
"the free version is unusable. you only have a number of skips, you cant listen to individual tracks on a playlist, 30 seconds ads that are annoying, playlists are undownloadable, seeking the previous track is impossible, and UI is literal garbage. over all of this it nags me to use spotify premium. unless you're willing to invest ~10 dollars a month for spotify premium (artists that use spotify as a platform dont see any of the money you give them) this app is garbage."
"the update is literally the worst update to any app I have, never has an app gone from great set up, lay out.........to nearly unusable, 7 years I have had spotify premium and built a great collection of songs and albums, now they are nowhere to be seen, you have to search them all, it's so bad I'm moving onto Amazon music, to start fresh as this update just annoys me that bad, who ever thought this was a good idea was having a breakdown mentally"
"New UI is so much worse, makes trying to find songs or albums much harder. Aesthetics shouldn't take priority over functionality. Highly considering stopping my premium subscription."
do you want an app with a user interface that somehow shows less usefull information than your average antivax pamflet? do you want an app that mixes music in your playlists handpicked by a algorithm that cant even tell the difference between a rock song and a medly cover? do you want an app which add system is so broken it can show you 10 for 3 minutes of use? do you want all this designed by a dev team that thinks that skipping said unwanted songs should cost €10/m? DO I HAVE THE APP FOR YOU!
The recent update to the library section of the app basically ruined the app for me. It was so clean and easy to use before and now it's a mess. Also taking away the ability to remove songs and artists from daily mixes definitely hurts my enjoyment.
"freezing issues, stopping in the middle if songs, having to push the forward or backwards button. I used to could play unplayable songs. There was a button I could push to play them, and it would work, not anymore! I'm so over Spotify!!!"
"HELLO?!?!? SPOTIFY ARE YOU TAKING YOUR SUBSCRIBERS INTO ACCOUNT? I have the same problem as many others have complained about. when the screen locks, the app stops playing. it does it even when I'm on my cars bluetooth. I have a premium account which means I'm paying for this shoddy service. fix it or I'll cancel my account and uninstall. Having to pull over to start the music up again defeats the purpose of using my hands free functions. That's a liability for U. I smell a lawsuit looming 😯"
"Since the last update, I can't pause or skip songs on the lock screen. Plus, although I quit all the apps, it keeps working in the notification panel and doesn't allow me to exit. Great disappointment. I think I am gonna leave spotify forever and try alternatives."
"since the new update I have been having issues with the downloaded songs not being there UNLESS I have data or Wi-Fi enabled. as soon as I'm offline, I have no music. quite the hassle when I'm paying to be able to listen to songs offline. won't be renewing my subscription if I can't have the music 🤷‍♂️"
"5 Star When using this app Free. Then try buy the Premium, several days and there is some unknown playlist and music in my Spotify. Quickly disconnect all the device and change my password. Its the first time i have experienced being Hacked, i search the community and found that Spotify is having trouble with its security. There are many report with similar incident, just google it ""Spotify Account Hacked"". Hope Spotify can improve it and please have Customer Support, not some community member."
bad i have to keep pushing the play button.which is dangerous is on Bluetooth while driving start a song it stops and i have to push play .next song it starts stops i jave to push play .it is dangerous and distracting to drivers.if not fixed soon i will cancel. it is inconvenient and unsafe thanks Spotify.and i pay for this smh
"The worst Android app i have on my phone. inability to ""connect"" when every other app on my phone is fine, widely known issues that have been discussed and known about for years with no efforts to fix them. Downloaded playlists are still unable to load while the app is ""connecting"" rendering the feature useless. Inconsistencies when skipping tracks and awful inconsistencies in UI. Will be switching services as I've needed to use the app more than desktop recently"
it's irritating adds sticks on the page even after playing the adds and you just can not change the song or you cannot do it only shows the adds like the adds didn't had dinner just came to see my face irritating adds irritating spotify and adds does get pass even if it has been played it just shows dismiss button which does not works it is just for showcase please even if I'm not using premium after seeing the add I should have been continue listening but you just there make money by premium
It says free music but unless you pay for the app it's designed to be a nuisance and impossible to enjoy. Doesn't offer anything over the competition. Is absolutely false in it's claim to be free
"since the last update, I only get a black screen or the log-in screen, which doesn't work. I was logged in before, but can't access any playlist. Stop messing around with something that works instead of ruining it for everyone. I'd like to see my premium access compensated for the affected period, but i doubt that will happen."
"It's hard to use When I want to listen to one song, there is no button to press play, all it has is a shuffle play button.. And When I press it, it doesn't play the song I want to listen to... This is really annoying, please make it easier"
"You guys really need to fix this app. The last few updates has completely ruined my experience. I am not sure if it is a S9 Plus specific issue or all android phones, but the song keeps pausing frequently in between (even downloaded and streaming on good internet) and it's frequently ruining the experience, especially in bluetooth mode when I am driving and the screen is off. Will really consider changing to another music streaming app if this keeps happening."
"issue 1 - my friend shares a song. when i click on it, it plays another song. happened twice. issue 2 - theres no way to play previous song. tapping Previous button restarts the current song. issue 3 - theres no way to see the songs queued in the list / played in the past. issue 4 - doesnt let me add songs to the list. horrible experience. if media attachment was allowed in review i would show you a recorded video!"
"Before the update, this was a brilliant app. Since then, the app won't open. On the rare occasions when it does open, it's unresponsive. I pay £9.99 a month and have done for quite a long while. I really hope that I don't have to uninstall and cancel the subscription. I have emailed the developer many times. The reply is always the same.... 'our very best technicians are looking into it'. It somehow feels as though I am being fobbed off and that actually they couldn't care less."
"I used it before Google play and for the last year I've been using Google play. I don't really like Google play that much but coming back to Spotify, I realized even though Google play sucks, the user experience on spotify is considerably worse! I can't even delete the queue all at once! I have to individually delete the each song stupid!!!!!!!😂🤣 cancelling never coming back!!!!!"
I can't dismiss some ads so then I can't control the screen. The app is working in the background when I press the buttons but I can't click anything on the screen because the ad is in the way.. ?
the new app is brutal. you can no longer viewed your saved songs by artist. the new design basically encourages the user to make playlists but sometimes you just want a convenient way to listen to your favourite songs by a specific artist. very disappointed in this redesign.
keeps getting stuck on the story of the clash ad. just stops playing at the end of the ad and plays nothing. if i quit the app and re open it makes no difference. if i disconnect from Chromecast it works on phone speakers until i reconnect to chromcast at which point it starts the clash ad again then locks up again. driving me crazy!
Changing my mind after gerring tired of constantly fighting with this garbage. Not even starting with the new awful design - the app refuses to work after 30 min of using it. Completely! I am sick of it. Will you ever fix this damned thing? All the last updates - and a new phone - and it's still crashing my whole phone like crazy!
Still no better than my last review. UI sucks please bring back the old one. Can't look up artists from what you have downloaded ( you have to play a nice memory game to remember and search yourself) and liked songs dont play in a nice linear format. it loops back after you play around 20 tracks. (I can see it now. your 2019 most listened to hated tracks as you never got round to listening to what you want). all round an awful app and the worst part is they're not even monitoring the comments
"Had the free version for quite a while and have enjoyed using it, but the latest update has made it unusable. Can't go to the home screen, library or search screens. The app crashes when I try. Poor testing with this version evidently."
"UI is extremely unfriendly. Initially, I was planning to upgrade to premium to get rid of ads. But after an hour trying to navigate the search engine, so I may create a playlist, I'm not so sure I want to spend my money on this app. Very frustrating!"
"pause buttons are unresponsive in lock screen. i use a samsung device (s9plus). hope this gets fixed, I'll change my ratings when that happens"
"The latest update ruined everything. I could only open the app and it showed nothing but the blank menu. I used to love this app so much and wanted to support it so I purchased premium app, and it would be such a disappointment if this keeps going on for days."
"can't listen to my downloaded music offline, can't even find the""offline mode"" button anyone with so many updates. I used to love this app, but at the moment it just sucks."
it keeps pausing I've ensured that my battery saver/optimizer does not affect app and its continuing to be an issue. if not resolved I'll have no choice but to pay so a different premium service!!!
I have been using the free version for quite sometime and this has been the worst update so far. I can't use in lock screen properly on Samsung S7 and can't skip ads anymore. Very frustrating!!
if i wanted to be agrivated id have more kids not pay for spotify. there is a long list of things that should be straight forward and intuitive but instead they make you push far more buttons than nesessary. as with many apps the more buttons you push the more money they make. well i not paying them to make them more money. i will be unsubscribing.
"horrible experience, no matter what I ty to play, a random dubstep song called ""acid"" in a radio edit playlist, will start playing, it will even start itself when I close the app including the notification bar. and they call that a premium experience? had to uninstall the app just to get some quiet."
"app wont load. have restarted both my phone and the app and have even uninstalled and reinstalled the app today, but it still wont load. has been squirly lately anyway, but this is ridiculous. I pay for this subscription and cant even use it. I am to the point of if this isnt fixed quickly, i am canceling my entire family's account. please help"
"Did not let me log in. i have tried to reset password multiple times at difderent ocxasoons. every time i clicked on the link, it openwd app and notified that link expired. 3 times in a row, till i quit trying. samsung galaxy s9."
"This new layout is the worst. Who thought this was a good idea? Because honestly, they need to go home already and stop ruining everything. All those songs i saved are in some ""Liked"" section??? I'll die before I scroll long enough to reach the R's. Why does my saved artists take me to their page? Saved artists were to access their one good song more efficiently. Someone needs to come up with a free apk again because this ain't worth paying for."
"Have been using the older app and loved it. Then my phone had an upgrade, and Spotify changed EVERYTHING. Support page no help. Everything that is supposed to be there, such as download button, nothing under settings but legal and something else. ALL if my library is go e, which was co miserable. Its mainly an app with no functions. An d I pay $9.99 a month for this??? And there is no way to talk to anyone. I seriously suggest rethinking this. Oh, btw, cannot sign in no matter what I do."
The app is good but customer service is horrible. Spotify was offering a free google home to its premium users. I pay for a family plan which cost more per month and when I reached out to Spotify to inquire if I could receive the same promotion I was told no. Even though I pay more per month than premium users to. I will be switching to a different streaming service as I refuse to pay a company that will not offer ALL its paying customers the same promotions.
Makes driving SO MUCH MORE DANGEROUS! Samsung Galaxy Note 8 USED to actually work with Bixby but now it won't for playing any music. Spotify kept getting in the way with nuisance requests to try to connect itself to Wayz which kept making me take my eyes off the road to dismiss. After installing it my phone no longer will recognize any other music service or commands to play any of my stored music on my phone. Instead it opens Spotify and plays some bs track I don't want while wasting my data.
"Why is the app icon different now? Why does it have a black border. Looks a lot less clean. Ive decided to go back to google music. Not because of the icon, but because of how the app is laid out and i just dont like it. Even the desktop website i dont like. Also a lot of the albums i want to download mostly older albums only have deluxe albums and what not and the tracklist is all different. Thos really kind of pissed me off. Will not be getting spotify premium again."
Lots of bugs. I literally have to uninstall the app when I'm not using it because it randomly opens itself and starts playing random music that I would never even listen to. Most of the time the buttons on the lock screen don't work. Way too many issues for a company of thid size.
"I've lost my password so of course I need to reset it. I enterd my email, spotify sent me a link to reset the password but every time I hit the button it would just say ""Link expired"". Are you kidding? You sent me the link just now. How am i suppose to use spotify if i can't log in."
"Whenever I click on a song in a playlist, it automatically puts the single song on repeat when I want to listen to the whole playlist. Makes it annoying having to click the button so that it'd actually play the playlist."
"First thing is dont force people to try stuff. ads i can understand. But the app is forcing to get free trial and if I am trying to dismiss it it won't happen i ll be taken back to current song and if I push BACK button, again free trial thing. . and that moment I decided to remove this app. its okay there are lot of other applications available. and now uninstalling the app."
"This app is rubbish. Don't get me wrong, I like Spotify just not the app. How can they get it so wrong, a five year old could design a more user friendly app. Too much wrong to describe. As a majour international entity Spotify should be a leader in app development but instead we get rubbish. You can have all the content in the world but it's pointless if customers can't easily access it."
"Spotify all of a sudden logged me out of my account so I tried to sign back in but I forgot my passward. I simply just chose the reset password option but every time I click on the button given to me through the email, it says the link is expired. So now I can't even use my spotify account."
"Newest update is so trash, the UI is inconvenient and the removal of the saved songs section is so annoying... Wish i could revert back to the old version, this is horrible."
The Spotify app shouldn't require the internet to browse artists. It should allow users to browse downloaded music by artist. The only way to retrieve music by artist when not connected to the internet is by search using the artist's name. But search doesn't group the somgs by album. To search you have to explicitly put the app in offline mode. The app should automatically go into offline mode when not connected to the internet.
"Crash on Kitkat. I run spotify first and play song. Then I try open Task To Do and suddenly spotify crash. I do the same again but using whatsapp. it crash again. I do the same but using Google Play Store and it crash again. DAMN. FIX THIS BUG! IT'S SO ANNOYING. I HAVE TO REOPEN SPOTIFY AGAIN, AGAIN AND AGAIN. If this bug is not fixed, I'll quit subscription and persuades the internet to do the same."
i admit when i first got this app it was an amazing experience. i could search and listen to all sorts of bands from mainstream to obscure. now however it seems that all i get are hindu hits and nature sounds mixed in with native. you have cerrainly ruined a good app and its been uninstalled and I will tell all my friends not to bother with spotify anymore.
"Hate it. it won't let me chose the song I want in my playlist,I click the 'more' button but when a click a song on it it gives me the stupid preview part. worst app I've downloaded and a waste of space"
Spotify stopped reacting to steering wheel button. I've tried uninstall and reinstall many times. But still the same. Spotify please do something. Thanks
"over a year usage, still cant learn my taste. worst song suggestions than free apps. why do all song suggestions must be sad, graveyard songs? in youtube, you can plan one song, hit the playlist button and you'll be send places, for hours!"
"this used to be the best paid music streaming service for me, now Spotify Premium is indistinguishable from the free version. They removed the all songs option which I used quite often. Now in offline mode I can't see any playlist or albums since I haven't downloaded complete albums or playlists yet, even though I have 16 gb of music on my device. Why would you remove features like this? I'm going back to apple music if this doesn't change."
My music keeps scratching and it ruins the whole listening experience. I keep having to constantly turn my phone screen on to stop the scratching noise but a few minutes after the screen times out the scratching starts again
"Can't even sign in. Can't change password, can't send support requests w/out signing in. Password reset links ALL ""invalid;"" email address alternately shown as either ""already taken"" (ahem. my account) or ""no account associated w/that email."" Forums direct me to support link that requires signin... UNINSTALLING GLADLY."
"Only gave one star so I could say how badly this app sucks. What I did like about the app was ruined with the latest release. It's infuriating to not be able to see all my downloaded music in one list and as of today I don't even get to see my recently played anymore. As soon as I can talk the rest of the family into it, I'll let my money do the talking and find another music source. Let me listen to music the way I choose."
"Super duper, eurodance! UPDATE: REDUCED TO 3 STARS: the app freezes so much, constantly either waiting for it to respond or closing the app. I will delete this soon if it continues for much longer. UPDATE: REDUCED TO 1 STAR. Freezes with one button press, android notification that tells me spotify is running wont go away, android notification that Spotify is using battery wont go away, freezes and crashes if you try to use any functions of the app, it behaves like a VIRUS, uninstalled."
"after last update on my Galaxy S8 the app suddenly stops playing music. I have to open the app and hit play button. Also when I want to restart the current song or go to the previous song with the widget on lock screen it is not possible, I have to unlock the phone and open the app."
"I love spotify but this app is horrendous. no other app has consistently encounters so many different problems when on my devices. locking up, thinking im offline, closing then continuing to play sound, failing to cast, not loading search page, failing to find friends, randomly changing to another song/playlist for no reason. So incredibly frustrating at times it takes me to breaking point and makes me want to go to the play store and leave a scathing review"
The app used to be amazing but now its absolutely rubbish with the new version. Now when I add a song it adds about 15 more so then I have to delete them. Making a playlist is way too time consuming. Now when I make a playlist its on shuffle mode (its impossible to change it without premuim) so I cant choose what song to kick off the playlist. This is a minor concern but still bad. Also when I play my playlist I often end up listening to some stupid 9 minute long song and you now cant skip songs
"I've had spotify for over 5 years, but this new update sucks. GIVE ME THE ABILITY TO TURN IT HORIZONTAL WHEN LISTENING TO MUSIC AGAIN!!!!! My aux jack is on the bottom of my phone, just like everyone elses, I turn it sideways so my chord doesn't get all bent."
Waited for it to launch in India for ages and the moment it launched signed up for the premium membership... Even though the audio quality and the app is perfect and intuitive but I'm really disappointed because majority of the songs that you want to listen are greyed out or not available... Even some of the famous chart toppers are greyed out... The membership fees is more than all the other competition and many songs are not available which results in destroying the experience.
"After the update its not the same anymore instead of the '+' it had a little heart to show that you 'like' the music rather than add to library, the albums don't show up properly i have duplicates of the same album and some are missing and it os not well designed anymore since the update yesterday, I pay for premium and I really don't want to pay for this change."
"keep asking upgrade premium to get beter experience, lack many futures in free user now, the old ui was the best, can't suffel more music now and can't play music from play list what ever you like to start , your apps is good on practical term only,"
The new UI update is sheerly sluggish. The albums in the albums tab take more than 2 sec to open. Like the old UI better because it's fast & fuild. Please take this into consideration.
"Just became a premium member, and you guys changed the layout. the layout isnt a problem to me but i really preferred the like dislike button before I took the premium subscription. also there seems to be some issue when you disconnect Bluetooth audio accessories, random muting, sudden play/pause. Specifically if i connect or change my Bluetooth headphones, the song plays for like 1or 2 seconds and just pauses and repeats the same every time I try to play it..."
Not only is the app non user friendly but now you can't seem to skip songs in your playlist because they made it a premium feature. Unbelievably bad UX coupled with a desire to get as much money out of you as possible. Don't bother. I've been a free member and paid in the past. It's on the way down and out with this attitude.
"used to love this app. but the bug that auto logs me out when in in offline mode *paid service feature* and i close the app. only to have to login and get the you cant login your in offline mode please connect to online to login. How can i be offline when im logged out, should be a simple fix. oh wait no online button at the login menu. only fix they have is unistall and reinstall all your music this has happened 4 times in a month as soon as my suscripton is done its goodbye spotify!"
"the pop up ad to advertise premium doesn't go away when i press ""dismiss"" so it blocks my feed. i can faintly see that I'm moving my feed underneath but i have to restart the app to see what im doing which is a nuisance"
"The last update has completely deterred me from wamting to use the spotify app. All my artists have disappeared, and i cannot find my music in my library through artists anymore. Even if i follow every single artist in my library, I cannot view them with only the songs I have saved to my library. In addition, my 'liked songs' or what should be my songs library, (but in this update, it is now counted as a playlist) deletes itself on average about once a week, requiring me to re-download"
very annoyed with the app lately. constantly freezes take forever to skip or pause tracks. nolonger shows quick controls on my lock screen. i have lg styo 4 with android 8.1.0
"the new UI made it so I cant sort through my downloaded music at all, even if I'm online, and I cant sort through my library at all it sucks change it back. AND I WANT AN ARTIST TAB THAT SHOW ARTIST AND THE WORK I HAVE DOWNLOADED BY THEM NOT THE ONLINE PAGES"
"Randomly disconnects from my car bluetooth and won't allow me to change the song on my stereo or steering wheel buttons- only by going into the app and skipping, in our out of the new garbage ""car view"" feature. Not very safe or useful in a situation where you need to be hands free. I'd love to be able to listen to control my music without either having to risk my safety to change a song or listen to the same 3 songs before it crashes again."
"Very displeased with using Spotify now. As a paid user I dislike the new view of albums, downloads and searching. The UI for the personal libray is now very frustratingly large and slow where it used to be concise and fast. Now, I might aswell put the kettle on and make a coffee in the time it takes to wait for my already downloaded albums to load. Not user friendly for the people who appreciated being able to listen to more than just playlists and podcasts. Very dissatisfied, lost customer..."
"Ruined the app for me, I rely on offline mode when im at sea, now I can't play music by artist😐. Honestly what a stupid change. also every update seems to make it harder to use, keep it simple, it was better years ago, don't think I'll be sticking around much longer!!!"
"cant use this application. I put my birth date month and year to register and it says I do not meet the age requirements, I was born in 1973. i tried several times. I am looking for a music program other than Pandora. Everyone told me to use this. Deceloper needs to fix this."
skips songs left and right. i use pandora all the time and songs never skip so i know its not my car or bluetooth issue. please look into this and fix it. i ruins my music experience.
"I renew my premium 2 days ago, March 27, then today the service I'm getting is like a free version since I can only skip up to 5 songs and I cant even click the previous button on the current playlist."
A majority of what I want to listen to is only available with pay service. The inability to skip is annoying. It seems the app is designed to get you to want the pay service. I don't appreciate the knudge.
"Functionality is absolutely terrible compared to the desktop app. Try to just load the website? They still nerf functionality, even if you select load as desktop. I will find another app that isn't purposely degrading user experience."
why the heck does this app require to unlock my phone every 20 seconds (literally) just to continue music playback. I pay a subscription for this as a premium service and it just does not perform. It has also recently ceased functionality with my smart watch too. Absolutely pathetic!
Most recent update ruins the experience of the app. Can't access artists in your library anymore. They want to emphasize Spotify-built content instead of allowing users to listen to what they want. This is going to be the update that pushes me to another music streaming service.
"There's a bug where the screen would be stuck on a blank page with a loading circle in the middle. This happens usually when you are in the app screen where you are in the page where you can see the album cover, the song you are playing, as well as the media controls and then you navigate to the previous page by pressing either the the button on the app itself or Android's navigation button. This happens even when I have the whole artist playlist or album downloaded for offline use."
"New UI for free users is the worst experience. The playlists are stuck in shuffle forcing the user to listen to whatever is thrown at them, whats worse is that there is a six skips per hour limit. Every update just makes the app worse. Dont even bother wasting your time on this app. Go download something else."
Music is quiet to the point of maxing out speaker volume to hear it. Then ads come on and they're obnoxiously loud. SoundCloud is better at this rate
"I hate the new update, you have ruined it, I can no longer view my Recently played, big mistake. And what you did to the artist view is just moronic. What a way to get people to cancel our Premium Subscription, I'm off."
"I've been on Spotify since it was invite only and paid for premium the entire time. I'm leaving for a different service as soon as I find one. The new UI is horrible. I don't need Spotify to tell me what music it thinks I'll like. Thanks, but no thanks."
"NEW INTERFACE IS AWFUL. Whoever thought it was a good idea to approve this update should be fired. Completely changed my using of the app and now all the features I liked are GONE. Whole different app. Probably going to cancel and uninstall. EDIT: Glad to see so many other people as upset as I am over the new UI. SPOTIFY FIX YOUR TERRIBLE ""NEW"" UPDATE AND GIVE US BACK THE OLD LAYOUT AND FUNCTIONALITY"
"Really bad song GUI. They have now these tiny videos for the songs which you can't DEACTIVATE and now you cant see the queued songs neither the duration of the songs because of these feature. It is shocking how bad a company like Spotify can design a GUI so bad Full of bugs, they really don't care about the bugs.."
"Poor recommendations, the ui constantly changes and sometimes doesn't work at all, the audio clicks and distorts due to Spotify's audio normalization. There are better options out there."
"I really liked spotify before it forced the track view open on songs that have video instead of normal album art. Also spotify has a problem that if you use it offline, and have to restart your phone, you cannot log in again because ""you are offline"" . Having to re-install spotify and download my music every time I restart my phone doesn't give a good user experience."
"since the latest update my songs pauses in the middle of songs,using through the car bt and sometimes at home with the soundbar,S8 user,fix it quickly or will cancel payment. In 1 week....."
although the sound experience is good and its a great app. There is no repeat or shuffle button. How can you not let me repeat a song or a playlist. Its annoying to not being able to just listen to the playlist continuously without having to hit play again and again
"I don't like the new layout that you guys put in, I mean instead of downloaded songs you guys changed it to liked songs. That's not only the thing that I hate about the new update, I also hate about you guys changed that when you're gonna search the songs that you've downloaded that you should the find linked song button, It's easier back then that you should only go up and then swipe down your thumb then boom! Also some songs that I've downloaded it just won't appear on my liked songs."
New UI makes the app extremely impractical. Accessing songs and artists through the library is now inconvenient. It appears a lot of people do not like this layout if you view the thread on Spotify's website. Seriously considering a different music streaming app.
"Spotify doesn't work with the new Samsung One UI/Pie 9 update. Songs stop randomly, the previous/next/pause buttons on the lock screen don't function half of the time (which in turn makes it unable for me to change songs whilst driving). Hopefully a minor glitch!"
"Ever since the new UI update for my S9, it had been absolutely awful.. while connected to my vehicles bluetooth, half the time it will either stop playing music or I can't even change the audio through my vehicles hands free buttons.. I've never had this issue ever since the new UI update for my s9. Please fix this issue."
"Recent update has absolutely ruined the app! Used the service for several years now, but now I can't listen to artists where I've downloaded songs, half of my saved content also seems to have disappeared. Very frustrating! Updates are supposed to improve the experience, not ruin it! Disappointed!"
The latest updates sucks. I couldn't open up my playlist. Some of my songs isn't downloaded through album and how am i supposed to listen to them. Previous updates in my library was better. It was easy to you. I'm going to look for another app and cancel my premuim subcription.
crashes constantly. since the update it no longer allows me to skip songs unless the app is open on my phone therefore when connected to bluetooth in my vehicle I cant change the song using the audio buttons on the vehicle.
"The on screen widget player crashes constantly after the new samsung UI update, so frustrating, if fixed i will keep using Spotify if not fixed i will look for another better app."
"They don't have half the songs that other streaming services have. No coldplay, no Twenty One Pilots among many others. Very disappointed with this app. Going back to saavn after the free month ends. The only good thing is the UI, which really suffers because of lack of songs, artists and podcasts too!"
"The most recent UI update is awful. All my downloaded songs can not be sorted by artist anymore. Instead, you have one massive unorganized playlist with all the saved songs. You have to add an artist just to get taken to the artist page, and not the songs you saved from them."
1 star review from a long time user of Spotify. New UI is garbage and really unnecessary. I don't know why you felt the need to change an already perfect app to something that is clunky to navigate through. Please consider changing back or I will definitely consider finding another streaming service.
if this new update isnt fixed I'll be finding a new music app. I have loved spotify but now when I save songs they dont go to my normal library. I shouldn't have to click 100 buttons to listen to the music I PAY to listen to
Since updating to the latest Samsung UI the latest version of Spotify is completely broken when streaming via bluetooth in my car. Audio cuts out every couple of min unless I unlock my phone. Please fix as its currently unusable
"new update has ruined it, was working perfect up until a few weeks ago. now it constantly stops working especially while connected to bluetooth devices. today's update has now completely broken the app for me, wont even load the app and just force closes within 5 seconds of pressing the button. fix it or revert back to old version."
"Many of the songs are not available in India. The same songs which are not available are there in other music streaming apps. So I dont see one good reason as to why I have to go Premium. Plus, the app has a lot of freezes and it crashes quite frequently. Freezes and crashes every bloody time. :/"
"was trying to figure out if this app is good to discover new bands when an unsolicited unannounced ad started to rape my speakers and my ears at high volume, i almost broke the power button on the radio. Felt just like picking up the soap in a prison shower, bbc surprise. going back to buying random music, i dont tolerate invasive and disrespectful advertising or support those serving them"
this is probably the worst update I've seen. I can't sort my downloaded songs offline by artist anymore. I have to scroll through all of my songs and even then it still isn't put together well. it's not near as intuitive as it was before.
Was great until this new update. Had no complaints. This recent update ruined controls for Bluetooth headphones and everything has to be controlled in app now. Spotify fix this.
"when using in the car, it stops and cuts out, my steering wheel controls no longer work, I also can't use the app on the lock screen the skip and back buttons just are not working :( and I pay for this!???"
I dont quite understand what has gone on over the last few years with this application.In over 4 years every update has made the App progressively worse. This is the first time I've ever put a critical review about an application but this last update has now made me want to cancel my subscription. Saved songs buried away in library now....why? You can no longer skip songs with bluetooth if the phone locks and you cant skip songs or even pause songs if the phone has locked. Please go back 4 years.
"I used to love Spotify and it's the main thing I play music/listen to podcasts on. The most recent update has ruined it, I can't skip songs on the lock screen, the songs keep cutting out and I have to press a button to restart. A song paused 13 times when I was trying to listen to it earlier. completely ruined my love for spotify"
"I have premium but new update is very frustrating. New design is hard to use and now the Songs section is thrown under Playlists as 'Liked Songs'?? Biggest problem though is that all full albums I've saved don't show up in the right order in Liked Songs list, so album order is jumbled. Ridiculous. Also Album and Artist sections are useless now. Have problems changing songs from lock screen. Not sure what happened to the recently played list at the bottom of the Music page on the older version."
"The latest updates have ruined the app for me. What was possibly wrong with the old layout? They've definitely killed the ease of access to music saved on the app. Why ""fix"" what wasn't broken? Hopefully they fix the issue or I'll be canceling my subscription.."
"latest update in the beginning of March has ruined this app. It never loads, constantly stops playing music and blue tooth never works properly. I want my money back, I would have never paid for such bad service. Spotify use to be good and I'd recommend it but now I tell people dont bother."
First time user of this app and I cant figure out how t play albums in the correct order. It doesnt appear to be a premium feature from what I can glean. The UI is confusing and options are all in non obvious places. A crime against UI design. Not sure what the hype is for spotify but if I cant play an album in the correct order then it's useless to me. That's a crime against music.
"New update is God awful. Some idiot decided to ruin the app completely. All my artists that I saved are completely gone, you can't save single song or a few songs by the artist anymore. Whoever decided to do this should be fire. Canceling my service from this BS"
new update is horrific. all my artists singles i have saved randomly saved into a favourites playlist. what ever happened to being apple to scroll through artists. The answer is to apparently select every artist and then follow them to have this feature. utterly rediculous. spoke yo them on twitter to give me no guidance on using the app. that's me moving back to Apple music
"One of the worst performing apps on android, Unfortunately seems to be gettong worse, randomly gets stuck in offline mode requiring a reboot in order to work. takes upto a minute, sometimes more in order to load the same playlist, im guessing spotify have never heard of offline caching. Sometimes scrolling through a playlist, the app will freeze and willl refresh, putting you back to the top. Very unhelpful error message ""something went wrong"". Search is very erratic"
"Latest update has made it unpredictable when bluetooth navigation works - when connected to my Bose QC35, button commands no longer work (play, pause, switch track). The same goes when i connect my phone to my Nissan Leaf, unable to switch track using cars navigation, and to my computer. Sometimes, for no reason i have discovered yet, navigation suddenly works. Updated devices but problem still remained. Tried another music app (shall not be named) and problem was not there. Issue with Spotify"
"I am waiting for an update with either Spotify or my Note 9, because I can no longer Pause or Skip a song when my phone is locked and the buttons show up beneath the time. please help?"
"I can't login using my facebook account. Neither can I signup using another email address. It says ""doesn't meet spotify's age requirements"" -.- and when I tried to reset my password, the link showed ""time out"" multiple times. please help."
"hi , if anyone from spotify is watching this , i used Spotify free for 2 days and bought premium , then the UI changed to this crappy version and my daily mix from the free version is missing also i can't able to use any of the online radio service please rectify this !!!!! Bought the premium for the love of music and also the very high quality really is not good You guys are not doing a very good job in india!!!! Your's sincerely A Music Lover !!!"
"Great service, terrible app design. Lags during start up, lock screen widget doesn't work and companion app for Gear S3 is bugged as well."
My card was overcharged back in December 2018 for an equivalent of 2 months of family subscription. Until now I haven't gotten any acceptable answer from spotify's customer service (since there's none) and they haven't refunded my money which they basically stole. I'm really disappointed with how poor this company's billing is handled. I'd give half a star if there's such a thing.
love the app but the new update has ruined music listening for me. I switched over from apple music because i can listen to my podcasts on spotify. But its not even worth it if i cant listen to my music and am only allowed to listen to Liked songs and songs spotify recommends to me for playlists. gonna delete my subscription and switch back to apple music if they dont change it before my next bill.
"Reposting as my last review got removed. New update is TERRIBLE. Will definitely be leaving if it's not fixed, nothing needed to be changed anyway! Now the majority of my artists are missing and you can add SOME of them back under 'artists you may like' along with a load of other suggestions that no one asked for. I may like them? Of course I like them, I saved them to my spotify for a reason, but now I can't even see the majority of them. Beyond stupid. It's also really buggy. You've ruined it."
"Recently can't pause music with lockscreen or headset and when I block a song, it keeps playing it... This app has gone downhill quickly and I'll be looking for alternatives for my money."
"newest update ruined everything. all my saved songs and artists disappeared but are still downloaded onto my phone, cant skip songs from my lock screen, constant crashes will be unsubscribing from my premium + hulu account if it isn't fixed soon."
"Spotify used to be really good but they keep changing the UI, removed the browse page, removed new releases. It's just confusing where things are located now."
"Great service, horrible app. Slow launch, too dependant on an internet connection, even for playing downloaded music and bringing up your library and the search UI. It chews up battery life faster than any other app on my phone. Literally the worst app I've ever used."
"can't pause the song via my bluetooth headphones sometimes. the device registers the button press, it plays the pause sound effect but Spotify keeps playing the song."
"Spotify: Premium Pushers The Good Old Spotify would let you put any song on that you want, let you skip unlimited times, not put trash songs on your playlist and let you choose where you want to skip to in your song. None of that is available without premium. Spotify gives many free trails but you have to pay if you dont spend a day finding the cancel button. I hate spotify now and i have converted to iTunes. Thanks Spotify"
"i got an an update a day or 2 ago and now i can't play all my saved music by a single artist, it just goes to their search page when i click on them. on top of that only artists that I'm following show up under artists to begin with... so frustrating. after paying for this service for years im probably going to have to switch to something else because this completely ruins the way i listen to my music 😖😖😖"
"Horrible new UI update, can't view my saved songs by artists anymore, offline songs unreachable unless theyre in a playlist. What are they thinking?"
"they take the best features away and tell you you have to buy the premium. its is difficult to enjoy user experience with out premium, and this app is just terrible you cant even watch music videos."
"Update ruined my experience. My artists tab is empty suddenly when it used to show all artists in my collection. I just want to listen to the music I have added, idgaf about finding new music via algorithm. I can still search my collection by album but there are way too many and I only like specific songs & albums so the artist page is annoying to use as well. Why force me to make playlists for every artist if I only want specific songs/albums from them?!"
This last update changed the design and i can't play music I've saved by artists. Only artist I've followed show up and even then it just takes me to the artists page. Please go back to the old design
"Spotify, Spoty fm. It's in the name. Briefly loose service it quits playing. Audio quality isn't even that great. Looking at other alternatives."
"The first time to try Spotify, i was feeling uncomfortable for the quick flashing images, which cannot be stopped , and I couldn't find any lyrics."
"Love the app, but the 1 star is because it becomes completely and utterly unusable after cancelling premium. Cannot hit a single button without a pop-up: ""you've discovered a premium feature, click here to upgrade"", even when doing things that ARE available to bon-paying users. Very nasty way to run a business."
"Ever since the last update the app keeps crashing, I can't skip songs using my Cars steering wheel buttons and my Bluetooth headphones(which worked before). The only way I can change is by going into the app itself and changing the song, but when I go to do that the app crashes."
"The app doesn't show repeat & shuffle button on the play card of the song, there's just like and hide this song button available and nothing else. These buttons are imp for daily users!"
"I'm really disappointed with Spotify. A lot of songs are missing in India. I mean a lot. The thing which I don't understand at all, why the hell does the free version have a better ui than the premium one. I used the free version for a few days, loved the interface and bought premium. And when I bought premium, the ui changed to this ugly old design. Please fix this fast!"
"The mobile app is unusable. You cannot choose a song to play - the single most basic feature required of a music streaming app. Users can only play an artist on shuffle, and skipping past a song more than 6 times in an hour is a paid premium feature. Less than worthless."
"The app just quits, at random times. Sometimes when I'm using my phone, sometimes just when I'm listening and it's on the table. Very annoying. Already reinstalled, idk what to do..."
latest version causing lots of issues. Samsung watch warning of high power drain. totally messed up with Android Auto in the car. please fix and update quickly!!!
Way too many Ads. Makes me feel forced to go Premium which is exactly why I won't. There is also a big difference between the volume of your Ads and the volume of music playing. If I listen to soft music your Ads will burst into speakers like thunders on a quiet rain. That sucks! Update: It seems like the Premium Service commercials are for people with real issues. Going to countryside and not listed to music?? 😲 Flying for 6h and only hearing own thoughts?? 😲 That must be unbearable... 😏
"Constant ads shoved down your throat and an almost unusable interface. A person links me a song, and there isn't even a play button?? No thanks."
It doesn't show me replay button anymore It doesn't have genius behind the lyrics part now Top Hits songs don't go full screen Video ain't supported. Not even mentioning the menacing ads overall completely disappointed.
I was cheated during the premium payment. I paid the amount and premium membership was not activated. They said that they haven't received any kind of payment from my card. After more than a dozen mails to the support team when the point was finally raised they stopped replying me. That was a monthly subscription and now I have to block my card to quit that automatic payment every month. I warn everyone to be careful and don't just blindly pay for the premium membership.
"new update is terrible, took all my liked songs and put them in albums. so I cannot shuffle. it also took the premium version off my account and now i have to wait 3 buisness days to re-register."
"I am mariner and using offline mode. application log out by itself and at the this point it's impossible to go online from online. you have to uninstall and reinstall. also all downloaded songs gone. it's same since 2016. it's happened to twice. next time I will quit Spotify. it's unforgivable error but especially doing nothing about it since 2016, this is totally not user friendly approach and not cool at all. shame on you Spotify"
Spotify just launched in India and so many songs seem to be missing from the app and apart from that there's no shuffle button anywhere in the player. The desktop version has the shuffle button but the songs are still missing. Fix this please.
You've ruined my entire experience of using Spotify by shuffling the songs and adding random tracks to the playlist I've created. Why can't I just pick and play a song and why can't you leave my playlist alone?
Can't download individual song being premium user. I was excited about its launch in India but I must say it's going to fail big time in India if you ask users to download entire playlist when you only need one song offline. I know Spotify is great at recommendations and UX but lack of this basic feature (which is available in every other music streaming service) will give away its potential market. Already planned for cancelling premium at the end of month.
The app experience is jarry by itself and needs few improvement . After placing songs on various playlist and downloading them there is no option to play them all at once . You have to individually play all playlist . No option to put another playlist on quee while other is playing . also the app needs some different UI background palette too . hope you improve until then my rating would be less .
"the ads wont disappear once you click the dismiss button and instead it would just click on the part where the music is playing. it had a fair amount of ads wayy back in 2013 but now, there are 3-4 ads that interrupt you before you can listen to 1-2 songs. if you get premium, you'll have to waste your storage downloading music to listen offline plus, you only have a few benefits when you get premium. i personally dont recomend until they fix these problems"
"Even though Spotify has provided high-quality songs and impressive playlists, I've found something quite brothering on its application. - unimpressive UI - Struggled when switching offline mode to online - No option for turn off the video loop in the blackgroud (it's very annoying) - Unnessesary transition when pressing the option menu (three-dot button). It's very slow."
"Absolute trash thst forces you to either buy the app or listen to what they wsnt you ti hesr fir the next 20 hours, you can't listen to a single song that you want to listen to but instead they put it in a Playlist where you have to listen ti 10 other songs before it amd you can't skip, you have to pay to be able to skip or listen to music, this is NOT a free app, this is a payed app in disguise and they are pushing it so damn hard"
"Ever since the one UI update, spotify just stops playing during a song or podcast. Please fix this as it is becoming increasingly annoying to use."
Had to uninstall because the shuffling was so bad. Do you need me to code you an algorithm for randomization? Get it together and give yer balls a tug. I really tried to give spotify the benefit of the doubt but you cut off one of my favorite songs by Pink Floyd to tell me about garbage. I will never try the premium because of that. Also tons of people I know are switching from premium back to basic because of the UI. I suggest you start listening to your users or keep piloting a sinking ship.
"Why do you only have credit card and paypal as payment method for a monthly subscription? Before I was subscribe to your premium and every month my monthly mobile load allowance is being deducted automatically but now, you just have that option for one time payment for a month upto 6 months for mobile load payment option. And the price is so much higher than credit card and paypal payment method. Do you just want to acquire credit card information with this."
"new update has ruined everything. it use to be great but now i cant even use my wirless headphones,i cant change songs using Bluetooth. it wont even let me change songs on my phone while locked. FIX THIS ISSUE!!!"
you cant skip songs on your playlist unless you have the paied subscription. also if you're looking for a specific song and want to play it the app will play a playlist of similar song on shuffle instead of the song you want. the only reason i use this app is to have an easy way to skip songs or look songs up on my PS4 while im playing games so i dont have to stop my game and bring up the spotify app tab by holding the ps button.
"i dont know what happened with the last update, but its ruining my phone. if the app is opened, it controls my volume settings, skips songs, stops songs, fast forwards in songs and sometimes completely changes to another artist/song radio all on its own. i cant just close the app either, cause it will reopen itself and make my phone difficult to use. i have to force stop it. ive tried rebooting, reinstalling, changing my settings. theres no point in me having spotify anymore."
"1. My playlists get changed without my consent, witch disturbs my peace. 2. You only get 6 skips, and when you start a song, you can't stop it. Why? This was a good app, but it's been ruined."
Doesnt have good service. i tried using two different gift cards to pay for subscription and both do not work. I've never seen this before in any company that use prepaid gift cards. one is one thing due to peeling but two? then the company has no accountability and way to ask to fix things. i am not continuing when my cards are up if they are fixed.
"i did love it but now that it throws ads in your face all the time and sometimes just shuts off for no reason its no worth using. i suggest any one with this problem just make a free youtube account and build a album/list there, at least it allows you to skip ads or have very short ones and doesn't shut off or suffer any glitches. i have and a galaxy s8 but my friends phones are doing the same thing (galaxy note 8+ and note 9)"
"Downloaded this app to create group playlists via Facebook Messenger, I logged in with my Facebook account but still couldn't ""connect"". The ""Create Group Playlist"" button was greyed out so I couldn't click it and underneath it read ""Connect to Facebook to create a group playlist"" I clicked this several times, it did nothing. Spotify help page just told me to do what I was already doing, no info on what to do if that didn't work. Useless App, may as well listen on YouTube, sane amount of ads!"
"spotify is an industry standard however that doesnt make it good it just makes it one of a few options. if you dont have premium then the ads are purposefully monotrnous and annoying, quite clearly they found that the more annoying the ad the more people paid. even when you pay the app refuses to load alot of the time and frequently to do a new search youll have to close the app. awful."
"I just want to play a single album for my son, can't make the suggested songs go away or even just pick my songs just preview... either the ui is too difficult on mobile or the app is just a worse version of pandora on mobile. either way, I'll stick with YouTube and pandora."
I am trying to upgrade to Premium but when I hit the button its not connecting. Have checked all my settings and have no idea why this is happening. Used to use this app but losing patience with it now.
"I have had a paid subscription for years, recently every time spotify is connected to my car I have adds coming on screen to use Waze, I select turn Waze off and 2 minutes later it prompts me again to use Waze, I dont even have Waze on my phone. The bottom line is a paid service should not have interuptive ads. One star for poor user experience."
"Spotify, please quit changing the settings on the app without my consent. If I want the stupid stranger things mode or lyrics on, I'll choose it when I want. This is so annoying!"
"The latest few updates completely broke the ""shuffle"" option. If I add a new album (12 songs) to my playlist of 2000+ songs and click the shuffle play button, all of the songs in that new album will ""randomly"" come up within the first 30 songs that the shuffle option. The odds that happening are extremely unlikely. So I tried it again with a new 10 song album. In the first 60 songs, the ""shuffle play"" button had both the most recent 10 and 12 song albums selected ""randomly"" in the queue. Awful"
"It's a great app if you have premium, but it's an awful app if you don't. Why do you force me to listen to songs I don't have any interest in what so ever because ""my playlist isn't varied enough"". I made the playlist like that because it's what I wanted to listen to. It wasn't like this before so don't say ""we are required to bla bla bla"". And the new layout is awful."
"i dont know why I'm paying for this super slow app version. it takes 30-60 seconds to play a song or to even respond to a pause or next/previous command... all my other apps work fine, to load a playlist or the search button or even my saved songs it can take more than 2 minutes, I still have more than 50% free on the SD card and it doesn't load, tskes forever to skip rhe song."
"this app is just horrible, I would search up a song and it would show up on the results, when I press it I can't play it, there is no play button, there's a shuffle option which plays a random song for you, but I can't play the song I want, this app just sucks, I'd rather stick to the app I was using before."
Nice service but the worst User Experience ever. I really cannot believe how this app can have such a terrible interface. I cannot find anything. I am constantly lost and really having trouble to access any function when I need it. AI and streaming are ok but UX is really terrible.
UI on Pixel 3 is terrible. Unable to play songs independently. Only samples and shuffle work. Can't find songs in search.
App is useless to me at this point. Freezes everytime it tries to play an ad. Requires fully shutting down the app and reopening.
"spotify is the worst! the cue system for songs is so non intuitive and difficult to use. they could literally just copy iTunes' cue system. when i close the app it deletes my cue! plus, they pay royalties from our membership fees to the most popular artists. not to artists youre actually listening to. talk about a corrupt and broken platform.."
"Awful button placement, poor user management options. If I make a playlist I want what I put on there, not whever the computer, wrongly, decides I want. Can you turn that off? how? I don't want to play shuffle I want them in order. Why can't I reorder playlists? Why is it so hard to just play, one song. Wish i'd never got this app and will delete soon."
This application does not function well with my Galaxy S9+ it is the worst user I interface I have experienced with a streaming app.I may try again with a different phone but I am done with spotify for the lack of fluidness with the app.
"Keeps crashing while opening since the last two updates ""unfortunately Spotify has stopped"". I'm very disappointed because I used to love this app and have been using it for 4 years now. Please fix this quick. I don't need any extra stuff in my app I want it to be quick and smooth so please fix this issue!!!!"
the new interface sucks. it lists artist's albums out of chronological order and doesn't even just some albums. the show more button doesn't work.
This has become the poorest music app I have ever seen lately. Sometimes when you kill the app the music will still play and when streaming music this app will rarely show the correct song. The app almost always shows another random song from the list and often streaming doesn't even work. The amount of times I had to kill and restart the app just to pause or play a song because the UI was out of sync and unresponsive is incredible.
It breaks my heart to Cancel my subscription. I love the UI spotify has and have been a premium user for quite some time. Since the Beginning I have this problem where my downloads keep disappearing. I have tried all the fixes i could scour from customer support and the internet. the problem still persist. Goodbye.
"Ever since the revamp I've quit using Spotify. I'll happily watch ads, buy forcing me to listen to 5 suggested songs per each song I WANT to listen to is ridiculous."
App keeps bugging out and skipping songs. Repeat button is slow to react and casting is always difficult. I'd expect much more considering I'm paying for premium and almost solely listen through the app.
"ok. why do you need to run so much in the background? My phone has a built-in battery tracker, and is this app that's consuming 73% of my battery even when the phone is not beig used. I constantly get reminders to force stop this app so my battery can last through the day. I don't know what game you're trying to play, but you have lost one user and one paid subscriber. Uninstalled."
"No matter how desperate you are, please, for the love of god, ONLY use Spotify on the desktop. At least there the UI makes sense and you can listen to what you actually want to without sitting through spotify's god awful ""reccomendations"". For now, at least."
"unable to logout, or even c!ose the app. Battery drains rapidly as a result. Really does need an on/off button. I can mute the sound, but cannot switch off except by uninstalling."
"I have to rate this as 1 star since it fails at the first hurdle for me - integration with Google Assistant is atrocious. Google Assistant finds the right song every time but the Spotify app just opens up but does not play the song. It seems to be stuck on whatever song it is already playing & doesn't respond to the signal to start a new song. And the Web UI on PC is buggy as well - most of the time clicking the Play button does nothing & I have to refresh the page. Great catalog, poor apps."
Bring back playlist sorting and search. Moving sorting and search to a menu makes the user experience so bad that I don't want to use the app any more. I used them all the time. Now I would find my self using the desktop client most of the time. Please bring them back to the top of the playlist.
one star at the moment spotify constantly quits playing my music and then proceededs to display that my whole downloaded library is loading. sometimes it takes 10 minutes to be able to play music again. I find my self fighting with restarting the app more than listening to music at times. considering canceling my subscription.
"great for premium users. unfortunately I dont want to use 10 dollars a month. for free users, they constantly play ads and will tell you to tap a button on screen to play an ad for 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening. if you dont tap, they play it anyway and you dont receive the 30 minutes. I dont know what they use for a song algorithm, but it sucks. they overplay a song to the point where you hate it. keep in mind, this won't happen for premium users. Also, free users get worse quality sound"
There's a thing I can't live without and that is Music but u guys make it so I don't want to listen to music because every 2 to 3 songs i hear an ad is clenched against the end of the song aswell as say i accidentally skop a song I can't even go back to the song since it's now required for someone to pay 9.99 just to even see the next song you will be listening to
I tried out premium. This app filled up all my 32gb internal storage. There is no option to move the cache to SD card. Very poor design and development choices.
1 star because the app is degrading by every update. No more search function on the top of playlists? Not possible to remove a song from a playlist directly from track menu (need to search for it in playlist and remove it there). Small things that make the user experience of this amazing service frustrating.
"Bring back playlist search! Spotify is my most used app. I love it to poeces, but 2 weeks ago they removed paypist seach. And now life is horrible. When your playlist is 1500+ songs long, search is a requirement. Bring it back, and I'll change this back to 5 stars."
"The fact that the app harasses you while your listening to music to pay for a membership ruins the whole thing not to mention random songs being added to my playlist that I think suck that I am forced to listen to because there is a limited number of skips (thanks genius) to get an actual song that I put on the playlist I also cannot select songs individually and have to ""SHUFFLE PLAY"". Do not get this app unless you have nerves of frickin adamantium or can pay for the subscription."
"Awful! since the last update it pauses every 10 to 15 seconds! Been using spotify for 10 years and the latest update has ruined it! Cancelling if its not fixed ASAP! Other apps that charge dont have this issue! sort it out, and no, deleting and reinstalling the app doesn't resolve it and my 200mb broadband isnt the issue!! Seriously disappointed!"
"i hate it, kind of heavy. ads too long. sucks ux. accidentally remove a song from playlist and can't re-added that. searching the same song only lead towards same playlist which is I can't listen because the song was removed"
"you can't really play the song you want, you have to wait for several songs to play before hearing what you wanted to hear. quite useless for listening to music, as it doesn't play what you asked but it plays what spotify thought you might want to hear. idiotic concept for people that search for particular song. it is not ""search for"", it is ""search like..."" which brings it down to one star. do not call it music app, call it a suggestions app, so users aren't mislead."
"Where has the option gone to search for songs in my playlists?!? What a ridiculous design choice, absolutely no thought given to those of us who use large playlists."
Your stuid app keep deleting all my downloaded music from the libraries. So I have to delete the app and format my SD card over and over and then download everything again . Why won't you fix this issue ? I mean you charge 10 dollars a month for a premium service and this is not acceptable.
"Ridiculous app. Starts playing songs through my Roberts totally randomly, plays ten seconds of a song before moving on to the next, sometimes works through Chromecast/Spotify Connect, sometimes doesn't. Totally unreliable. Won't be continuing premium subscription unless it gets better."
"Unless you have or are willing to buy Premium, the mobile app is worthless. You can't choose which songs to play easily, have a limited number of skips per hour, and only lets you preview specific songs. Couple those with a strange UI with no explanations of anything and you have a recipe for a garbage app. Maybe it's better if you have Premium. But I'm not going to buy Premium because a company deliberately makes using their product actively painful unless you give them (more) money (outside of the advertisement block every half hour)."
They removed the search bar on mobile playlists and moved it to an inconvenient place. Other than that the overall mobile design is horrendous.
Shuffle and repeat disappeared. Also I can't log out because they buried that button somewhere. I had to uninstall and reinstall to log in with a different account. Super dumb engineering. Even if it's a bug it's a pretty stupid design that features simply disappear.
The latest update is a lesson is horrible UI design. Have to go through a menu to search for a song within my playlist and to even sort. Why in gods name would you hide needed functionality behind an additional menu? How did you help in anyway?
"Please move the filter bar back to its rightful place on playlists so I can actually find songs I want. The ""find in playlist"" button simply makes it harder to use."
Load and search times time out with full connection contantly. Navigations miss basic needs and require going through pointless menus to get to things like just navigating to artist or album. Complete garbage software.
"I used to love Spotify and I am currently paying for a family plan, but it has unfortunately stopped working! I have reached out to Spotify and also tried searching the web for cures-- nothing! I have uninstalled the app and will be discontinuing service with then and switching to Pandora or Amazon. Truly upsets me because music is my life!"
The latest update broke Android Auto offline mode as now it requires the Internet connection to work with Android Auto. It has worked without an Internet connection prior to the update. Hope Spotify will FIX IT.
"you can never choose the song, untill you pay. and trash songs are coming next what I am listening and I can't even change it. unless I pay also. Go For Soundcloud, at least it doesn't require continuous payments."
"Really bad app. I am a part of a family account and get absolutely nothing for it! It's constantly trying to sell me premium even tho I'm on a family one. It Rams adverts down my neck and I literally can't get it to just play the song I want. It just says ""shuffle"" I open the the playlist to play a specific song and it plays 5 seconds of it? Horrible user experience and pointless having a family account"
"Now I may not be an app developer, but I think it's fairly safe to say that if I need to Google ""how to play music on Spotify"", then you've failed as an app designer. I added one song I wanted to listen to, hit play, and it proceeded to play 3 songs I've never heard of and have no interest in. I don't ask a lot from a music app, all that I do ask is that it plays the music I want to hear. This doesn't."
"My phone has a quite decent specs but it takes too long to respond to buttons and seek, even stops midsong. I tried every ""fix"" I can find thru google and nothing fixes it. RIP"
Current update really pushes normal users to go premium to gain back the old normal privileges... Also good attempt to modernize the UI but it's messy and they add songs to playlists apparently.
"Unless you pay $10 a month, good luck ever listening to the song you want to since shuffle will ruin your day and the trash songs they force into any playlist you make so you can never listen to the music you added is a great feature."
"Haven't been able to properly open this app for a few weeks now. When it does, I try to select a playlist and then it just freezes. Then, if I don't force quit it in the background, it significantly drains my battery. I've tried many troubleshooting steps, but I'm about to pull my subscription for premium."
"The app is quick and easy to use but uninstall is a horror show, basically once they have your money you better say goodbye to it and be thankful they don't Increase the amount. For some weird reason amending your account has to be done via a website not the app, login to said website is awkward to say the least and refuses to acknowledge your user name or password, might as well just say stand and deliver. Notice the handy link stating they care about your opinion and no hard feelings... Well they have no feelings and like sky or virgin once they have you just pay and shut the f.. K up"
"Won't stop playing suggestions I hate. Too many ads, can only listen on shuffle without paying, changed settings did nothing. Sadly I have to say this ruined my experience."
"Lackluster and unintuitive User Interface. Missing shortcuts makes you click a lot back and forth, and with all the limits to free accounts, the sound quality could at least be decent. Would pay for the better sound quality if UI didn't suck. App hasn't developed notably since release, apart from reducing the quality on free users."
I still do not have the app on my screen to tap and play music. I must go to spotify and log in to get to music Why can't your system transfer an app when the system is downloaded I'll probably have to quit soon because its doharf to get to the music
"Used to work fine, now takes extremely painful amounts of time to load searches and my library. Whatever song I play first upon opening the app stays on the bottom bar of the app even when I play other music. Somehow they managed to break shuffle so it now only shuffles within the most recent songs in your library. Why am I paying premium for your devs to ruin perfectly basic things about the app that should be good by standard."
"Am a premium customer and have lost the ability to use ""Radio"" due to UI testing. I'd spent a long time refining my radio playlists and they were the main thing I'd listen to."
"a) the current version drains the batterie like hell!!! b) even if a song is downloaded, but there is temporarely no network connection, it stops playing. c) it has no usefull ""back"" button."
Since yesterday it just keeps crashing no idea why. It's so frustrating cause i just renewed my premium foenthis month. Wishing i had just paid for youtube music tbh 😡😡. UPDATE** they seem to have resolved the issue at least they fixed it quickly 😊😊😊
"Guys what have you done, I have used Spotify for ages but your latest update has ruined the experience. It takes forever to load my music and when posting the songs buffer. PLEASE sort it out"
"really irritating that alllll that played are suggested songs and not my playlists... I mean i made a playlist because that's what i like to list to. definitely deleting g this app. and no I'm not a premium user because that's something i dont have the luxury to afford, but it used to be soooo much better. tolerable at least"
"I want to change my review to a 4 or 5. But yesterday I began having a bug where the home tab shows nothing but a black screen, with the settings, search, home, and premium buttons on the bottom. The other screens work, and streaming works, but the home screen does not. An unistall and reinstall did not fix the issue."
Since the update on October 22nd the app crashes about every 30 seconds. Spotify released another update on the 25th and nothing has changed I have another phone with an older version of the app pre 22nd update on it and it's flawless but on my other phone which has automatic updates turned on I really cannot use the app anymore. Which is quite disappointing. I'm really hoping that they get this fixed as soon as possible because I'm about to DJ an event with 250 people of friends and family and I'm hoping that I can load the older version on my tablet to plug into my DJ equipment.
Latest update removed the radio button. When I choose to view artist or album of current song playing it just takes me to the home page. Equalizer causes sound issues at the start of each track. How could such a popular app be just so terrible!?
"Ads are far too frequent, highly repetitive and seemingly designed to annoy the consumer into purchasing premium. Occasionally get ads in other languages too."
"I used to love Spotify but ever since the recent and quite drastic updates it crashes on my phone (Samsung S7 edge) every 5 seconds, rendering the app useless. I would be interested to know if other Android users are experiencing the same thing."
Persistent offline bugs Spotify randomly deletes songs Don't buy the modern doctrine of poor performance products and services that seek to maximize user experience. It is inherently bad.
"what's with shuffle? i make my playlist but out of nowhere another song came out. only add 2 song to playlist, click the shuffle button, an unkown song played. what the.. and the organizing system is complicated af. cant choose song to play! i want song A but there's no page for me to choose just one song to play?"
"They took away the browse button. What? Yeah, I can't just browse podcasts or genres anymore. Instead it's, home, search, library. Now they just force feed what they want me to see. Give me back the browse button"
"This keeps crashing on my s8 constantly since it updated itself!! please fix it because it's driving me mad, I pay for premium but can't even listen to any songs!!! I've cleared the cache, I've uninstalled and redownloaded it, I've logged in and out, I've restarted my phone, I've played around with battery settings and NOTHING fixes it. you have broken it, now fix it quick!!!! I don't pay you monthly for 20 seconds of a song!!!"
"Most recent update(s) ruined the app, it crashes at least three times before you're able to play a song, then after finishing said song, you go to select a new song and it crashes again. Please go back to previous patches."
"I've been a loyal Spotify premium user since the service was first made available in Canada. Since upgrading to the Samsung Galaxy S8 recently, though & doing the latest Android update, the Spotify app has become useless for me • a quick Google search turns up LOADS of similar complaints from other S8 & Android users, too & it doesn't look like anything is being done about it. This is absolutely unacceptable!! You're about to lose another customer."
"They ruined it by forcing you to shuffle play every playlist and by limiting the amount of songs you can skip per hour. The moment they bring this ""feature"" over to PC is the moment i leave Spotify for good."
Downloaded app and signed up for trial. App refused to load. Rebooted phone and uninstalled app. Reinstallation got stuck. At top dollar pricing I'd expect FAR better user experience than this. I'll stick with Google Play music.
"To limited free version. Plays multiple ads in a row. Got a hold of premium version. Worst suggestions on market. Both Pandora and YouTube do much better. Disliked 10+ songs by artist, liked 0, still get songs by that band. Web version YouTube broken. 90% core features don't work: one can't just like/dislike a song on web version. One can't build as songs to playlist. I wonder if my username is so rare, but multiple questions online make me sound that. I'll update list eventually. In general: by now better pay Pandora if you're ok with their selection, or YouTube. Spotify is worth it only if you can get drastical discount, or have no other options."
I've been using premium for a few years now and for about a month the app has been deleting my music and not letting me save. I'm ending my premium here pretty quick along with a large number of people I know. you had a great thing and now it's ruined
"The privacy settings keeps opening in a browser. When I resume the app, open it from the menu etc. This is either a bug or a poor design."
"Spotify on desktop pc is fantastic but the app is just the the worst, horrible UI, does a lot of weird stuff it shouldn't. Adds random music to my personal playlists, can't play songs out of my playlist, instead i can just listen to a preview. Suddenly my on wheel commands would not work (never had this problem with other music apps). An app never triggered my nerves like this one did, on the other hand many people seem to be ok with it so let's say it's just not appropriate for my intended use."
Sound quality is quite poor. Even at premium it's best 320kbps. Interface is not simplified and too much work to navigate just to listen to songs. Streaming audio isn't quite there as we're limited to data caps so quality has to be sacrificed.
"Constantly pauses music on its own, or says its playing but produces no sound. Often requires restart or reinstall to do its primary function. Convoluted, misleading UX. Good thing - it has songs, when it works"
"Omg, this has to be the worst UI I have seen. Terrible, hard to find anything. The controls you want are difficult to find and use."
"Look, Spotify is undoubtedly the best music streaming service... for consumers. It's a great service. Here's the thing though: Spotify may be the best and biggest, but it doesn't pay even close to the highest amount of revenue to artists per stream. The amount artists make from Spotify is a miserable tuppence compared to other streaming services that are inferior in every other way. Napster, which is an unintuitive, messy app with a far, far smaller user-base pays a uniform ~1.7 cents per stream -- about 300% what Spotify pays to artists. Spotify, I love you, but there is no reason why you shouldn't be better to artists than this. The artists deserve better from you. And when you decide to get your act together I'll be back, but in the meantime I'll be buying music straight from the artists and streaming on Napster. Hope to see you soon."
"This app is terrible. Spotify use scumbag tactics to annoy the hell out of you so you pay for their premium service. The app layout is awful and awkward to navigate and they don't let you choose the songs you listen to, their horrible algorithm chooses for you! They force you to listen to ads and waste your time as if they're entitled to it. Use the desktop and don't bother with the app. These songs are also available to listen to elsewhere for free, and SoundCloud is a much better mobile app as even if some songs do require a subscription, free users aren't harassed, you can skip ads and what do you know, actually choose the songs you listen to! Yeah, this app sucks."
UI sucks and the free accounts have better looking one lol. And if it is strongly in just music why not have higher music quality I know of apps that provide a better sound quality. Spotify sounds like they muffle every song
"Absolute rubbish, ive used this app as my only music software for years but they've introduced these stupid music suggestions, which is fine, but even when you're listing to your OWN music from you OWN premade playlist they pop up inbetween your songs even after you click the exit button to say you don't want to hear it they play another one... 10 minutes later i was wanting to throw my phone at the wall and on top of that I've pressed don't play again button about six times on a couple of songs and it stopped, played adverts, and started again, all i wanted was a nice relaxing shower as im hot and bothered at the end of the day... NOT IMPRESSED spotify you better correct this cos that makes your app pretty useless that no one can listen to their own playlist 😡😡👎👎👎"
Ruined in the last patch. I used this app for six years without a single issue and the last update has bricked this app completely on my galaxy s7. Fix your stuff Spotify or my premium subscription will be finding a new competitior.
"Finally got around to leaving them the rating they deserve. Thanks to them pressuring me to leave a 5 star review via popup. I am appalled by so many aspects of spotify - their persistent vendor-lock-in attempts first and foremost, but also their dreadful application UX, bad performance, lack of proper Linux support (broken blobs), ... As it so often is with these things, I hate it - but with them being a monopolist, what choice do I have?"
"Broken. When switching back to app after it being in the background, it can't establish a connection and thinks it's offline. It also doesn't respond to my attempts to change volume with hard buttons. Constantly have to close app and start up again."
"Ok, listen I wanted to listen to queen, so i chose the playlist ""this is queen."" When i hit the shuffle button, cause there's obviously no other way to play it, it started. Ok, so it's fine, right? Guess what, i wanted to listen to queen. Not abba. So why are you randomly putting them in the ""this is queen"" playlist? I really don't get it. It also happened when I tried listening to the beatles, and when I tried listening to other musicians. You just push songs into playlists, and yes sometimes it helps but like come on in a ""this is {musician name}"" WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SONGS THAT THAT MUSICIAN CREATED, you cant push other musician's music! Its stupid, unhelpful, and just annoying."
"Every version is worst I have a pixel 2xl and the app is really slow, difficult to use and have a lot of UI issues. Spotify does not care about their customers use Google play music"
"I am incredibly frustrated with only one thing on this app but it completely ruins the entire experience. The ""search"" function. Each and everyday I open this app, I am unable to search for songs. It states I am offline when I have Wi-Fi and on 4G. The only temporary fix I have found is uninstalling and installing the app again and again and again but the issue consists. The fact I am paying for premium monthly when there are free apps out there shows my love for this app. But if this issue doesn't get resolved, I'm stepping away from Spotify."
hated the latest update. why do you have to redirect me to the song radio when i select a song? i want the actual song page so that i can put it in loop. this is a wrong move for user experience
"Bugs everywhere on Android 8. It stops playing for no reason, the UI loses track, the song playing is not the same being shown, .... And many more."
"Keeps on locking in offline mode despite settings all to online. Need to uninstall and reinstall and fix, which then requires redownloading all songs. Very frustrating."
"On android, you have to uninstall and reinstall between each song because if the offline/online bug. At this time, spotify is worse than worthless and a 7 year user has just quit."
"Shuffle Controls Everything, And App itself force Music and artist on you without relevancy. Why not just listen to the radio? Only reason I'd recommend this app to anyone is the simple fact that it has quantity. As far as user experience I think it the worst I've had yet."
App wont work if I'm not connected to wifi (even then it likes to pretend I'm offline) I've searched and searched for a setting to fix this. App is either broken or just has awful settings design.
"So so many bugs on Android, and a terrible user experience. I'm forever waiting on things to load, in online or offline mode. And it often thinks I'm offline when I'm definitely online. I expect more for such a global, and paid for service. Awful."
"Its a software nightmare. Songs stop playing randomly every 10 min, or 3 songs. After skipping songs in a playlist it gets stuck visually, 50% of the time I can continue listening but the other 50% it just crashes/stops playing. Listening to podcasts and I for example pause it ""externally"", either via locked screen or a play/stop button on my earbuds, it doesnt't start where I left of but where I started to listen (so basically it starts from the beginning). The locked screen interface to skip songs or play/stop doesn't work majority of the time. Spotify is supposed to be this pristine music service with solid bases that may not be perfect, but it is solid. To pay for this horrible service is a slap to the face. It feels like a crappy free app. It says alot when it feels like that for frekin Spotify."
"Fix you broken app. I've been paying for premium for over 2 years and all of a sudden it won't load any of the windows or searched items. And your dislike function for Spotify playlists is rubbish. I have literally thumbs downed the same artist since I got premium and to this day it still pops up in every Spotify playlist that is ""tailored to suit me""."
The app used to be good. The app now is so bad I'm switching to sound cloud because I can't even listen to my playlist correctly without shuffle play. There should be a button that says turn off shuffle play.
"What the hell is going on. Since the update the next song cannot auto play, oftenly stop at the end of the song and i have to press next button to listen the next song . Im a premium user. Please fix this soon"
"What is going on with this app? Latest update has ruined it. My music stops for no reason. I am not able to see the devise shortcut in the homescreen and my playlist often lags on music that is downloaded. Please fix, before I switch to apple music"
"When you search for a song and select to play it, it doesn't play that selected song. Instead, it plays a song in the ""song radio"" feature, which is in itself already a horrible feature design that should be removed. What kind of paid music steaming service won't play the song that you specifically search for and selected? Does that sound intelligent to you Spotify?"
"The recent update has ruined my user experience. Like others have noted, the app stops playing at least three times an hour, controls have disappeared from the lock screen, shuffle library doesn't work properly and continues to play when disconnected from Bluetooth headset or speaker. Hardly premium service"
It doesn't work right but used to. It literally starts playing whenever it wants. It will change songs but 95% of the time it doesn't update to say what song it is super annoying bout to quit paying for it
"Latest update has caused nothing but headaches. Shortcut in the app notification bar disappears, android auto requires the app be open before you connect it or it lags out and you have to restart your phone just to get capabilities back in regards to changing songs."
"New update for android is terrible! Please fix! I have spotify premium but i wont continue to pay for an app that keeps randomly shutting down, keeps playing when bluetooth is turned off or auxiliary cord is removed. My phone isn't recognising spotify as a media player at all, and i can see from other reviews that im not the only one! Fix it!!!"
"Spotify you have massively screwed something up on the latest updates, weird behaviour all over the place. Pausing itself, unpausing itself while in different apps, lock screen bar always incorrect, play button in pull down menu doesn't work!!! Geez great app love it but this has got to the point of considering another service after a few weeks of this! OMFG it was completely closed and has reopened itself and started playing even as I type this! DON NOT PAY FOR PREMIUM WHILE THIS APP IS PLAYING UP LIKE THIS!!!"
"Music control not showing in notification center, bad Chromecast connection and the ability to make a queue. Also, shuffle play button not working, stopping playing after 3 songs."
"Very often it looses the connection to internet and says ""Sorry, something went wrong"" though connection is perfectly fine. UI needs work as well, finding things takes longer than expected, some albums are not even there and discover weekly gives me songs that I trully hate.. Sometimes you get ads on premium (drakes latest album) and support is not very helpful either, the only good thing is that Spotify has albums listed as soon as they are released."
Garbage app. Terrible UX if you like listening to albums. Three stars until recent updates when it had been exceptionally buggy. Randomly stops playing.
These guys spend way to much time screwing up their app while they're saying they are making it better. That is not the case. Seems they removed the ability to thumb up and thumb down any song. I'm also having a very difficult time finding the cancel button for my subscription.
"App is getting crappier as time goes on. Won't load songs, slow to load on a good connection. Also randomly stops playing music quite often."
"Current issues with the app are: no notification, can't change music without entering app, can't skip more than three songs without it jamming, constantly thinks it's offline so cannot search or play non-downloaded music, doesn't recognise when Bluetooth is disconnected, can't pause/play from Bluetooth, cuts itself off every 20 minutes. There are complaints on their forum about this from over three months ago so it's really bizarre they haven't either patched it or rolled back to a previous version that does work while they rebuild an obviously disastrous update. When it worked it was the best music app - but not by much, and any one of the issues above should be enough for most people to use GPM or Amazon Music or Apple Music or YouTube Music or any of the other plethora of options."
"Piece of absolute garbage!!!!!Wouldn't let me search online ever again after one random day. I have premium and it keeps saying I'm offline. The ""offline mode"" button is off. I tried reinstalling, I tried logging out Then in. I tried turning my phone off I tried different Wi-Fi I tried everything. It still says I'm offline which is ridiculous. Now I can't play any songs I don't have downloaded. Ridiculous. Uninstalling. Cancelling sub. Getting Pandora. I'm sick of this useless app."
"Note 9 running latest edition constantly having issue after issue So far.... - widget doesn't display current song, -After selecting shuffle in my songs play I can only skip 2 songs and then the UI will bug out - browse will intermittently have an error till it fixes itself..."
Not a fan of the UI. Song playing does not match what's showing. Also noticed that recent reviews are not very good and that Spotify does not respond to their subscribers in the review section.
