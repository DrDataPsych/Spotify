review_description
I dont pay for many services but Spotify Premium is worth it to me. Ive been able to rediscover music I had forgotten about and can always find a playlist to suit my mood.
"My style of music, I get what I'm looking for and quickly"
Amazing user experience with plenty of options on music/podcasts
"Yeah what is to add, best app to listen to music. Premium users on family plan, which is quite reasonably priced. Appreciate the music quality options for download/streaming."
"Didn't realize how amazing Spotify is until I used Amazon Music (free trial). This app is far, far superior to Amazon Music. Very intuitive, quick, and does exactly what you want it to."
"5 stars, the only thing that annoys me is when you accidentally click the like button on an old song that you liked, so you remove it from liked songs and you can't undo it. If it at least wasn't right next to play/pause button..."
"so many bugs! remote playing basically does not work at all, the UI does often not respond and random playing does not work."
Recommendations are so damn Perfect. Interface is quite good and with the green and black theme it feels sick !
"I have been using Spotify for my family and I since 2015. And I never intend to stop. It is my most used app on my phone. I love having Premium. It is definitely worth the money, everything about Spotify is amazing, and I've already managed to convert quite a few people. Keep up the incredible work. The pre-made Playlists are great for indecisive people such as myself, that only know the mood they're in, and Spotify does all the rest!! They literally have everything you could ask for, and more!"
"I take this app for granted! Thank you Spotify for making a good app. After using the disgusting app of YouTube Music, I appreciate Spotify so much more! Great UI, good functionality, awesome features! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Spotify something is wrong with my liked songs when I click on the button it shows a blank space
I have enjoyed the ease of using the app. It's so easy to build a playlist. I have recommended the app to others and will continue to do so.
"I've had a couple problems with spotify over the years, but nothing major. Recently my Facebook got hacked which is how I log in and I could no longer access my spotify account. Their customer service had me all fixed up in less than 10 minuits through a text service. I was amazed."
It's a really great company. And I have a wide variety of music. I get the gift cards every so often so I don't have to pay a prescription. I really like that option. And also has good sound quality. The only thing I wish they had was a down button like some other competitors but other than that it's a great app. And great customer service I had a problem once and they fixed it within minutes. And we're very professional and polite. Keep up the good work Spotify
Learned my likes quickly! App is easy to setup and use. It's also exposed me to great artist I didn't know.
Latest update made some of my playlists on mobile inaccessible waiting on a fix I need pc just to press play button
"Probably the best music streaming platform...high quality music and very classy ui I love everything about Spotify And yes, the premium plan is very affordable and worth the money."
"Outstanding platform for listening songs , Spotify is the best app than any other ü§©üíï, love its features and UI very much. Very user-friendly (except those unwanted and daily same recommendations üòí) but like this platform should be listening our favourite songs as well as new songs."
Good ui interface
"Awesome platform, but, with all the ads (5 30sec ads at times) and still not being able to listen songs in order sux, even ruin listening to a single artist when the shuffle jumps to other artists you don't want"
"Now that the loading issues are fixed, app is great and even the free version is quite nice(granted you use the browser/desktop versions to create playlists)."
"Efficient, effective honestly one of the best apps I have ever used. The algorithm is spectacular always finds what I want. If you are looking for an app to use to find specific songs you don't know: Spotify is great for that or Shazam. 9/10 still needs ux upgrades and more control."
IOS app UI is better... please make it like that _ atleast add the swipe controls
Its been great as a deaf person i use special equipment to hear my favorite songs the ones i missed when i was a teenager. So thanks for the anxiety relief.
it getsmy style of music quick and authors that i forgot about
I love my Spotify. I love music from classical for Bubble baths ! I listen to Liberace to Rock and Roll for bangin' your head ! Thanks Quiet Riot !!! There's music for every mood ! For everyone ! It's just to bad premium isn't free. I listen to music instead of watching TV. Why watch other people doing something and getting nothing done when I could be doing something myself.
"Let it be the quality of songs, the suggestions or the usability of the UI, all the features are very attractive and lovable. Could have had more collection of old Telugu songs."
Amazing It's a quick and wonderful app . Works in a few seconds to find the sing I'm looking for it's just great
"I love Spotify. I can start with a old favourite like Zep, Floyd, CCR and Spotify gives great recommendations for other artists I might like. From that new artist I get further recommendations and so on. Its grown my listening habits considerably. As for Podcasts, last year I didn't bother with them. Now I have quite a few on the go. Great sport pods and my new favourite The Rockonteurs. With Gary Kemp and Guy Pratt."
Brilliant. Love this app so much. This is all I need to access the songs I ‚ù§ and its all I listen to. I no longer play cds as I have everything at a touch of a button here. Best thing ever.
Everything works well. UI is intuitive.
"Really what to say other than I've been using Spotify in a major way for the last few years and the experience is pure pleasure for the ears. I prefer having premium, but I have had to go back to the free version multiple times for financial reasons and I still keep my library and have access to all my songs while online which is great. I can even continue building my library for free. This one's a keeper üòÄ"
A reliable app for music of general kinds. Quite reliable and dependable for musical entertainment.
I really enjoy Spotify easy to use affordable easy and quick browse any music of your choice bigup Spotify
I always find what I'm looking fit to suit my mood.
"Excellent music app. I've been using Spotify for years now and it's really revolutionized the way I listen to and find music, the value for money is phenomenal when compared to buying individual albums, although I do hope the artists get a fair share of the monthly subscription. Most of the time the app works really well but sometimes it does have some issues with queuing & saving songs, etc. Also being able to que songs on Samsung galaxy watch would be awesome. Thanks for the great app Spotify."
Awesome. The best of all music apps out there. Love the data analytics used and the user experience.
"Spotify is the best music streaming service I have used so far. I hold a student account and it gives me the ability to have Premium at a cheaper price. However, if you are not a university student, Premium is quite expensive... Spotify free is quite good when using a laptop (can select songs, unlimited skips), but is very basic for mobile user (playlist order is random, only significant amount of skips per hour, you cannot download, and more). Spotify is VERY basic if you do not have premium..."
Please change back the play button to where it was! ‚èÆ‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚è≠ The new design (‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚èÆ‚è≠) is neither practical nor aesthetically pleasing. Update: it's back to normal :D
I love this app and have been using it for quite a bit now. It's a cool app and is cool how you can listen to your favorite music for free. I really recommend getting Spotify.
Amazing for streaming music reccomend you buy premuim for the ads to go away
"I am enjoying the music on spotify it is wonderful to have a whole new music experience, more wider variety of song request which is absolutely brilliant. I really like spotify and i wouldn't like to be without it. You deserve five stars from me because you are brilliant. Keep the good music coming, and thank you so much. I am having issues using the back button to play the same song again especially if i like it. The forward arrow is lit up but the back arrow is not which is quite frustrating."
I love Spotify. So much. I pay for premium and recently for the past few weeks Spotify was not working. At all. The app wouldn't even open. I emailed Spotify and they emailed me back very quickly and worked with me to get everything working. I did have to email twice to get it to work but it's fine. It's working now and I am so happy! Thank you Spotify!
"I like this app very much. There are quite a lot of adds but still, their music is the best. Love it so much."
"Believe me.Spotify is the best. The best of spotify is It's sound.Literally no any audio app can beat spotify in audio quality.In ""Very High"" or in ""High"" it's sounds are heaven! And the second best thing is: It's UI. This is one of the best. Literally the UI is so user friendly.and here comes the looks of the UI.It's too good and looking great in a simple look,with no hazardous thing in the UI. And the another one is: It makes a playlist or remix type based on your played list.This is good."
I've only started used this app.along with my new phone and I'm finding the music available quite good thank you
I'm giving you guys 5 stars for not cancelling Joe Rogan. And also because your streaming service is quite good üòÖ
"Great app. Also love the fact that one can listen to any song for free if one isn't ready to upgrade. And the app does well to recommend daily mix and albums that are more personalized for the user. And by the way, the UI is great. Keep improving."
Great... fantastic...SPOTIFY was designed especially for me (With me in mind). Thank you.
"I really love the app, i get to explore more music and quite a number of podcast without any hinderance"
"Brilliant thanks, I love using Spotify. It is so easy to use and adapt quickly to my laptop, mobile phone and Fitbit watch. My music everywhere with me. Peace and love"
"very quick on search and low data usage .. ,üëç"
Amazing versatile app. Totally suits my needs for my work as breathwork Facilitator and for my personal use.
Queue button is blurred out. Why?
Pause button works again as of today! Happy with the app again.
"It works, seamless, pick a song or build a playlist, change it up."
"Beautiful graphics, lively navigation, refreshing designs, and sound clarity. I've been using Amazon Prime Music for over a year because it doesn't have ads but I abandoned it for Spotify; you could imagine why would anyone drop an ad-free app to come back to a limited service: quality!"
My most used app. I love sleep mode and being able to change playback speeds. The only thing I wish would go away is driving mode paired with maps. It never is intuitive or helpful for me with my Samsung. It's more distracting.
"Had Spotify premium for a while now and love it. Especially the lack of censorship to the podcasts that don't quite follow the mainstream narrative (if you know what I mean) Recently had an issue on the Android app and Spotify were amazingly quick at helping... Thanks guys for the help, thanks for not censoring like everyone else, you have my money"
"Great clarity,easy navigation and useful buttons"
Please test your ui in dark mode time slider is not visible. Overall app and your service is best.
It's not without occasional quirks but I can always find my happy place with the amazing variety of music!
"The new UI is awful. Put the play button back in the middle, please"
"I love Spotify,It has let me build my library of music back up in digital format.Very Cool App.Highly Recommended!"
"Love the musics, the applications ui and ux are awesome"
"Best music streaming service period. The best UI for both mobile desktop and TV, that makes it great. Also, all podcasts are there. I did test out tidal, youtube music and deezer but this is just the best."
Quick and easy to get songs and artists
"I like the app until, when I go offline and play my downloaded songs. It pause itself when it reaches in the middle of every 4th song, I keep clicking play and then when it reaches 4 songs again, it pauses it self again in the middle of the song. Please fix this. PLEASE FIX THISSS üëÜ Additional, I didn't turn on my shuffle but the song keeps on shuffling even if I turn off the shuffle button."
"The premium is definitely worth it! Quite inexpensive as well for students :) P.S. Very disappointed that the preview songs option while creating a playlist is removed. Just why would you do that! It was so good, now it sucks! If the changes are reverted back in a month or so consider me unsubscribed. It's not like there are no alternatives! Please fix it! Else you risk losing a lot of your listeners for sure... P.S.2 Thanks for giving it back!"
All great muisc in one place.. Very nice
"For me Spotify is perfect. Is quick and easy to use. You can listen to music online or offline, just download the music and volai! Spotify has basically every song you could ever want, though they are some mashups and remixes that don't exist here but instead on YouTube and SoundCloud. But otherwise, 5 out of 5 for me"
"Best recommendation system, best UI best streaming service on premium if u don't have premium it's bad"
Love being able to build a playlist of my own.
Great app quickly adds new songs I like it I recommend my friends also
"This app is SPOT on. (no pun intended. Well, maybe a little) As an audiophile, I really appreciate the ability to fill my ear holes with whatever suits my mood at any given moment. The side Hulu subscription is a nice bonus. Keep upthe good work and kudos for locking down Last Podcast on the Left."
"Good for designing a playlist, bad for c sides you can't find anywhere other than the tube"
I do say it is simple exquisite and I was in awe that it played more songs than my Gucci cassette player
"Quite a few commercials which is a bit annoying, but then again you can skip them!? LIKE WHAAAT LOL got to say that's dope lol . Anyway I do like Spotify overall I switched from YouTube play music to Spotify recently n my oy regret is just not switching sooner"
Great app! The enhance button was the best thing ever to find new music. Bring that on back now ya hear? üòÅ‚úåüèΩüíö
Good app for hearing music and podcast. I love hearing songs and I always use this app. Premium subscription rate are quite less and there are many offer though with you can subscribe.
"What's up with the button positions, who decided it was a good idea. I get it if it was on Android auto or something but on a phone seriously. Sometimes the decision you guys make baffle me. If this keeps happening you will lose customers."
"I love this app because I love to draw while listening to music before I knew this app existed I always used YouTube and I couldn't listen to music while looking at my images in my gallery so this was a really big help, I just wish there was a loop button so I don't have to keep restarting it over and over again"
Amazing app. Love the design and sound quality. Premium is 100% worth it.
"Spotify is the best way to listen to music on mobile or tablet. Search for any track, artist or album and listen for free. Make and share playlists. Build your biggest, best ever music collection. Get inspired with personal recommendations, and readym"
I build lists of the music I love and explore new music without limits. This is my best music buy in years.
Spotify is the best music app ever. It give only one ads of 30 seconds and you can listen uninterrupted song for 30 min.‚ù§Ô∏è And this app has quite smooth experience üôÇ must download it.
"This is the best music platform, I admit to that especially when the user subscribes to it. But certain problems I'm not so happy with is that it doesn't refresh and show recently released hits. I'll have to see them in other apps them download them on Spotify or follow the artist. I'll still give it a complete rating, 'cause the updates lately are good. It'd be satisfactory if I hear an artist dropped a track and I see it quickly on the home page. Please work on this. It'd be acknowledged"
"New UI with the play button in the left most just feels weird, please fix it to the standard button layout."
Best music streaming service I have ever used. UI is simple and sophisticated. Spotify also features many personalization options that makes the app feel like it was built for you.
"Can't listen to music, playlists for ALL are showing empty. Tried Uninstalling, clearing cache, rebooting...nothing has helped. I have a paid subscription and can't use the service. Update: Customer support was quick to address the issue and offered an easy solution to the problem. Thank you."
"Great music,all the songs l grew up with at the push of a button."
"I Love SpotifyüôÇ they have every song in the world, love graphics and lyric option"
Simple to use...suggestions are easy to use and easy with a simple üëå play button
"I love the Spotify has Personal he designed playlist, That it releases weekly helps me find good new music, it's a great app"
Spotify has a large library and you can almost find every 9 out of 10 songs quickly. Spotify has become my favorite brand because of the service and overall experience. I've Premium Service so I never get hit by any ads while enjoying the music in very high quality. üëå
Spotify is a very good place to listen to music but it's not the best without premuim. But on the bright side premuim is not very expensive and in fact quite affordable it is a clever business method to earn and I'm down for it
This is the best song recommendation app. Also you can listen to podcasts which are very well designed.
Great user experience with a cheap premium option that make listening very enjoyable without ads. The AI is fantastic and suggests songs I have never heard of that match my music taste
"I am fully satisfied with the musics heard during my work, actually not listening to the words but encouraged with the rhythm for continuing my work....."
"No adds, loads quickly, and all the music I like!"
"Most recent update is the worst yet. Extreme lag, constantly having to restart the app, and the new Library feature is 10 steps back from the previous UI. Please address these issues or I will no longer be paying for this service."
"Phone remote to tablet to stereo(s), excellent programming. Excellent entertainment. Spotify is so good you just might quit watching tv...Fantastic playlist generator, and perfect operation with only 2G of freespace. And You, You will have fun-guaranteed-and thats just the free version. Home cache clear."
Outstanding music streaming. Even obscure music can be found. Rarely issues and when they occur they are fixed quickly.
"Perfect -- extremely well designed, seamless across all my devices, fast/responsive, simple interface. Kudos to the development team and UI designers."
"Was reading some reviews and im quite disapointed, so many complains about skiping or ads or songs added to a playlist, please upgrade to premium. The COMPANY and the ARTISTS are not making any money from free accounts, and then you hear most complains from these individuals, if you cant afford it yet pls dont give 1 to 2 stars to an app that you are freeloading from. Our plan is spot family, P214($3.8) for 6 fam members, that is P36 ea person/ month. Doesnt even dent ur monthly income friends"
"This app is great. The only problem that I have with it is that it is really laggy. Some of my songs won't play will use my skips. Also, I'll use one skip and the app won't let me use any more of my skips. This was all a while ago but I thought I should let you guys know. I have premuin now and it works great."
I've been listening to music with Spotify for well over a decade. It's been really cool watching it grow into the app I now know and love. It's super helpful that I can search for songs by lyrics and song recognization. I do wish the player would automatically show up in my push notifications like it used to on my old phone but I think that's more of a design flaw in my new device's software.

Personalization is their Forte love having Playlists designed just for me!!! DAILY
Gives great music at touch of a button
Very useful in a quite time
"I want to know what happend the collaborative button because now i cant add songs on others people's playlist. I updated it many times but the collabrative button wont pop up, and also can you guys put a spotify chat system on there its gettin really boring trying to talk by putting songs on other people's playlist Overall its great."
Love the quality and availability of my favourite by a push of a button
"Spotify changed my whole world after my son told me about it years ago. What? They have full albums? They have albums from the 70's?? Tears were shed as I would have a musical memory, do a quick search, and bam! The Best of Bread, Twin Sons of Different Mothers, Rumours --it doesn't get any better than this. Totally worth it people.üíóüíóüíó"
"Thank you for returning back normal position of media control buttons. Please, avoid this kind of experiments in the future."
very good with all types of music to suit everyone.
One suggestion: Add shuffle and repeat buttons to the mini player in lock screen
Pretty easy to use and organized UI/UX
Exceptional application and exquisite terms of use.
"I don't if it's just me or what, but I hate it when the share lyrics button removed on my spotify, I'd suggest to put that feature again."
Doesn't have streaming issues n it quite entertaining and you gotta get it if u don't already have it
"Quite easy, not at all what I expected. But, as they say never expect have hope."
Please bring back the notif button for offline mode. Huhuhu. i'll give you 5 stars if you do that üòä
"this app is good, but sometimes there are bugs, like recently the buttons are kind of not in their right positions which is weird lol."
Been with Spotify for years now and love it the app is amazing especially on tvs great services üëè really impressed with it done a good job especially the premium listening i to offline where ever i go its amazing 2022: recently with the new update the sound quality has gotten quiter and idk y it must be to due with the update I compared it with sound cloud same song and on sound cloud its louder. Spotify can u please fix this.
"The overall experience is good. Asian songs, especially Chinese songs have less resources. The UI of the lyrics display module can be more beautiful."
"One little bug where what was playing wouldn't come up, preventing the ability to pause. Fixed quickly, and been absolutely great otherwise."
All in one service that allows me to access my library across devices. I love the UI as well as the easy to understand functionalities this app comes with.
"Later edit: Ok, this was fixed, after some updates.Please leave the + and - buttons near each other, in my list (library) for adding/removing proposed songs. Also it would be nice we could have some filters or a way to arrange the songs in the created lists"
Very quick and easy. Love it!
I love Spotify so much. Although I would like a customizable UI to make it better.
"So far, so good. Good design collection as well!"
Great selection of music and the ability to quickly create your own playlist that can be public or private.
Spotify has always worked just fine for me just wish premium was free but hey Rome wasn't built in a day
Love the intuitive play lists.
"Everything is really good. easy to use, good design, big community and song collection. Hope for better sound quality. And maybe some social features, could really raise the time spent on app. More widgets please."
"Awesome!! Thank you to the creators of Spotify!! I fu ki' love it!!! You guys have introduced me to the most wicked singles and subsequent albums. Truly, emphatically, I'm virtually certain I will never require another music platform. (Perhaps the integration of artist videos would be appreciated by many of your 'loyal subjects'). Again, Dear Spotify constitutents, THANK YOU!!!!!!!"
"The easiest music player I have ever used....original and cleaned music and songs are there...You can create playlist as your preference and list manually....especially in laptop web version and for tablets, it's fully free but cannot download music....there are ads available but which is not much annoying...So, newcomers why are you still waiting here...just tap the install button & explore the unlimited music universe..."
Recent update has ruined this app. Good UI and app was great before. Now music constantly stops and app crashes or doesn't load.
"Idk what are people on. Awesome app as always. Just pay 5 bucks or just stay quiet. Five bucks is nothing and by paying it, every door opens up. And no, there are no adds on Spotify Premium. Never was."
I find the app quite pleasent. It has nice music and it gives you songs you might like according to the previous songs you have listened to.
"Amazing, easily the best UI and music app in general I've seen anywhere."
Excellent app. Music to suit everyone and every mood or event. Love it.
This is really interesting app because this help me as motivation guide
Best songs collection and UI
"Been waiting for the update with lyrics on phone for quite a while but I still don't see them even though I have Premium. I have clean uninstalled and reinstalled the newest version multiple times, logged out back in twice as suggested in forums but no luck. It works on all my friends Android devices. Desktop version shows them for me. Unfinished/broken features on paid subscriptions is a big red flag for me. Gonna drop the rating to 1 star till fixed."
Great service! And a pretty crisp design
"The coustmer service is the best...they reply the mails quickly and it takes maximum 2 days for them to fix any problem within the app ....well it was 2 days for me. I enjoy the premium, and to be true i loved that they have premium for University students, and it's very cheap."
Thanks for reverting the playback control buttons to their initial places.
The app has been quite easy to use. So far I have had no issues with it.
This app makes finding the music that suits you easy. It can also pair with several devices enabling you access to the convenience that it provides. This app truly is a masterpiece and I encourage the developer's to keep adding more cutting edge software into the interfaces and security aspects.
Simple and easy to use design. Grrat for looking up new songs. Especially for when i need that hype somg for new PR attempts inthe gym. Plus podcasts. Its good.
Hi I love this app so much but there is only 1 problem why I can't open ishowspeed shake song can. U please fix this ;( i can't quit this app I love it so much
"Been a Spotify Premium member for years and wouldn't change a thing. It's the gold standard in streaming music. Quite simply, Apple Music was too late to the party and I've never felt the need to switch. Spotify gets everything right, hands down."
"Seamless streaming, intuitive recommendations and every artist you could hope to find."
Crystal clear quality of sound and quick update of new release
UI is back to normal now but I keep getting a premium tab even tho I already have premium. Doesnt affect anything and just returns me to where I last was but kinda weird
Thanks for bringing back the playlist button. Now it's perfect.
"Love this app & the team behind it. Once I had a problem on my PC: Arch Linux, Gnome desktop environment and they managed to fix it within a single day! Nothing I would expect from such a big company."
"I love being able to make my own Playlists and listen to my favorite music. Amazing ui interface, and easy to navigate with a plethora of options."
Great UI and good Playlists
"Great music App and sharing platform. Menus/ choices are a not intuitively placed requiring you to explore but, works well."
I have been using many music aps in the past 10 years or so... I find Spotify the best one in terms of functanality and ease of use... Still few improvements required like usage in poor network areas... Need to fix that
Spotify has become my go-to music platform for a while now. Really appreciate the work that goes into this app. I got premium and spent 20k minutes last year listening to music on here üòÖ. I have one genuine feature request - blocking podcasts / removing them from suggestions on the home screen. Love you guys!
"Get rid of the "" Hidden"" button. I accidentally hit the button but I could not find an option to bring the song back. Thank God, I was able to figure out the name of the song to add back to my Playlist."
"Love it! The interface, UI UX, stopped using all other music app... But I am finding it hard to make payment tho .."
Very neat. Really good UI and very enjoyable
"Wonderful! I would love a bit more intuition for the Android app like the Apple version is, but it does the job. Most of my songs recommended aren't similar to what I listen to, but you'll find a nugget or two. Neat stuff"
Overall good experience nice interface I am totally satisfy with spotify every experience but if you reduce 1 month charges 89 rupees genuinely i am glad and It's become a more good option for music lover and I will recommend
"I love Spotify it is really good to use. Although the shuffle button has been driving me crazy. Every time I go on a Playlist the shuffle button is always there, and I hate the shuffle button because I put my favorite songs in a certain order, and when I shuffle my music it goes out of order and then it plays only five songs and then goes on autoplay when I know I have more than five songs on every Playlist. I want the version where we just had the play button. Not just the shuffle button."
They changed the now playing back thank God!! Old review: Why change the now playing page UI and take away the lyrics button? What backwards A/B testing is this???
Super app it recommended song which suits our mood
"The app is great but sometimes I'm indecisive of what I want to listen to, I just want to listen to something. Can you maybe add a button like the one netflix has (surprise me) or something. That would be really great especially if it plays something related to the kind of music we listen to. Wonderful app nevertheless."
Great app to listen to mdu favorite music. Simple and premium price is affordable. Sound quality is fantastic. Its a great feature that we can download songs. Also i have a suggetion to add playback speed buttona
I been on Spotify for years. Continue to build with multiple classics...
Top notch Features with Clean UI. Just Amazing ü§©
"Thank you for fixing the button order, that's the way it should be :)"
Thanks for placing the play/ pause button controls back to it's original position!
"Since I first started suing Spotify at the turn of 2021, I have actually been flabbergasted at the range and variety of music that is on here; there is literally nothing that I can think of that I lhave not been able to find boatload's of, it really is mind blowing; I have enough to listen to 24/7, and that for me is a big deal. I rate Spotify as worth every pound/dollar, or Euro, and then some. Angelo GB."
"Still Great! The new changes, and improvements you have made are stellar. Thank you for continuing to work so hard, to make all the music available, available to all the people. Jam On!!"
Quite easy to search the search the song I need and that's all for now
It takes two attempts to open this app in Android Auto. If I am using I heart radio it won't switch to Spotify on the first try. It always takes two pokes at the Spotify button to open Spotify. This has been corrected.
"I've only just started using it, but it's so much better than Amazon music. It has a wider range of music and it's world music library is amazing. I even found an album by my old music teacher Luis Morais from Cabo Verde. Check him out, you won't be disappointed."
I refuse to switch services and/or use ANY OTHER MUSIC APP. I love Spotify SO much I low-key recruit people to join the team. We're all winners here. üíöüñ§
"Been playing a different 'mood' every day . Spotify is quite smart like that. Today, 'Calipso.'"
I love Spotify! The music selection is a music üíï dream. When Spotify put The Faragher Brother on it's stream I was thrilled. With that being said other streaming app have music I enjoy that can't be streamed on Spotify. I have discovered music mentioned in films because Spotify name was linked to the song. I enjoy how Spotify pay attention to my listening pattern and build excellent playlist for me.
I've used Spotify for a long time and it's never failed to remain consistent. It's also been extremely quick to notify me when my favorite artists and bands have new music releasing.
"The service is easy to use. The UI is simple, yet elegant, responsive and easy to navigate."
Music comes out very clear but when connect to Bluetooth headphones gets very quiet can barely hear the music even with volume turned all the way up
The best app to listen music online i use free version but I didn't a lot of ads it's better than others music in ADS and ui
"How can you not give 5 stars to your own personel jukebox for $10 a month! As a music fanatic from a very early age to playing guitar for almost 40 years, this is the greatest thing technology can do for me, in my car, at home, on my phone, and they even have my album on here! ""KEGASAURUS WRECKS"" c'mon man! Thank you Spotify!!"
"Incredible app, i myself as a EDM artist, song writer, producer and Dj love this place. Great place to start off as a new artist, and also a great place to build reputation."
"Edit 09/06: They fixed it, thanks! Who ever signed off on having the ""go back"" button replaced by the ""like"" button in the notification bar please reverse it. People don't click like on songs nearly as much as they click on previous track."
"Spotify meets all your need and music you like to listen to on a daily basis! no matter what Genre, spotify is accessible and available to all and has a great premimuim monthly deal for those who do not like adds and skip songs on the daily."
Better recommendations than any other music service providers. Nothing's quiet like it!
Really like it. Quite intuitive.
"Phenomenal selection of music, excellent quality and a user friendly gui makes this a great app. Thank you the Developers."
Wow! Spotify is so wonderful üíï it works quickly and it's very easy to use itüëèüëè
"I don't have anything bad to say a far as the app is. It's a little bit pricey for anything other than the free account. It could have less adds in between but I know that's how they keep it free. A shuffle button for all the play list would be great so one could access longer music play. I still think it's the best app to listen to really anything but Garth Brooks, and maybe a few others that don't release for free, understandable they got to make up for tickets master fee to simply print."
"Spotify is the best, if you're a music lover I recommend you guiz to download this."
This App is perfectly fine dark theme mode i love it suits me wonderfully love everything of this App But recently i don't like what it does it undownloads some of my albums i have enough storage but it still does that than i have to download them all over again for why if i already downloaded them Spotify is upsetting me lately. But what i llike actually not like but love the fact that it gives you a few days to pay your account because sometimes my money isn't in the bank right away AWESOME!!!
Need for an audio search button for music.
"I loved it It had best experience instead of other applications. But after latest update, When I open it it automatically closes Please fix this quickly as possible......"
"Spotify was the best thing that happen to life. Work and studying are so much easier with spotify, and I have music for every mood Im in, even if Im not awake, and if I need something to fall asleep too, I only hape to press one button."
Great sound and the way a person can build a playlist fantastic!!Superb!!
I'm looking forward having the equivalent of qobuz within Spotify some day. But until then I very pleased from the app and the recommendation engine and the Playlist generated for me. Already 6 years a customer;-)
This app Is Amazing overall That's why I give it 5 stars I'm not going to take away a star but how come You can choose to listen to a specific song on pc/laptop but not mobile seems quite unfair That we need premium
If you love and even NEED to have music on your phone then you NEED this app. Cannot say enough good things about these guys and their well designed app.
"Great music service. Loads quick, easy search, works on all of my home devices. Fast downloads."
Speakers to your best liking equalizer they should have an equalizer on this app to where it's built in to where you can modify the music
Great music app except the adds all other things are quit well. My experience with Spotify is really mindblowing.
I use the free version so far. I'm trying to learn how to make playlists. It's quite confusing. But I love Spotify.
"I have had Spotify for years...then as my children grew, I took the family package. We absolutely LOVE Spotify. We each use it on a daily basis. Music is a must in our home and to have absolutely everything under the shining sun, at the touch of a button...just brilliant! The app is easy to navigate and I love how the majority of the songs have the lyrics below. Quite honestly, if I had to, i'd give up any other luxury before even contemplating giving up Spotify."
App keeps crashing when I press play the play button after the new update. Will change my score once this is fixed. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it still doesn't fix the issue. Using a Vivo X70 Pro. *Updated review* Issue fixed
Music lovers dream app. Truly exceptional and expands ones Musical pursuits in ways unexpectedly.Brilliant.
"Awesome app! Love it! Easy to use and search for different songs and artist. Many good functions that makes it an all-around app. To put it simpel, it have almost everything you need and its easy to use. Just hope they bring back the ""dislike button"" you could click on songs or artist you don't like so they won't automatically play anymore, that was one of my favorite futures! Great work otherwise! :)"
"Spotify has been the best music app have seen in my entire life, kudos to the originator, from the graphics and composure all are top notch üëåüèæü•∞"
Spotify is the best! I've never come across anything like it. I've downloaded many of these music apps but I always end up deleting them cos they don't exactly suit my taste and at some point I concluded I'm probably not a music person but not this time. Spotify it is!!! Where have you been all my life!
I quite like the usability of the app
"Long time user. First time reviewer. As a listener I have always had an excellent user experience and I love the contextual listening it provides. I have discovered a lot of new artists, who I then support by buying their merch, attending their shows when they are in my area. I have been using (paid) for almost a decade. I love the the flow between devices: desktop to mobile, tv to tablet. Very easy to move with from home to vehicle to on a walk."
I am quite pleased with Spotify üòä learned about it from a friend
"This is indeed the best music platform you'll ever find on play store. It has a high quality music audio, amazing graphics and much more, definitely recommending it!!"
I've rated 5 star before ... But now the app is crashing constantly can't play a single song ... When I hit the play button it crashes. I'm a premium user and for the past week Spotify is utterly useless for me. Fix the issue
A quick music app which not buffer like others
"Great app. They play latest and old music to suit every client. The app plays smooth and doesn't have connection interruptions. I actually appreciate the adds on the app because the service it provides saves me a lot of money, time, and research. I just love Spotify. Great work guys"
I highly recommend this app for anyone that loves listening to music. It's offers you the chance to listen to any song that best suit your moment.üî•üíØüöÄ
Great music choices! Sound is great! Love it! Keep the sound playing in background but be able to mute or pause button control could be added forvconvenience!
"Love this app. Great library, great sound, very nice and intuitive interface. Tried Tidal and it didn't compare with the User interface. A seamless experience.... Just waiting for the HiFi edition now! üòä"
"Its been my main music app for years, love that it gives you suggestions for new stuff to build lists with and makes it super simple to find more by artist/genre etc."
"This app keeps crashing when using any GPS app. It will crash, if not left open and my GPS apps are on picture on picture. If I have the screen to my GPS apps, Google maps and Hammer, and Spotify in the background, Spotify will play for less than a minute then crash. To get Spotify to work again, I have to hit my pages button, hit the Spotify app, and wait up to 3 minutes for it to come back and continue playing, but it will continue playing 3 minutes before it crashed. Update: its been better"
"Guys literally, do you want to delete your app or what?. TOO MUCH ADS. 3 - 4 ads in a row, do you even know how much disturbing and disgusting it is. Ruins the mood completely."
"Very quick and easy to use, can listen to music anywhere I go through my mobile."
I am very happy with this app. Playlist are very easy to build edit and use. You have music I am surprised to find and can't find on other sites
"Very nice one complaint is sometimes it requires you to buy premium to play your personalisation but it's kind of rare so overall amazing platform, great songs,podcasts and other related items!"
I love Spotify but I can't shuffle my music anymore it just has that play button
It's available on so much media equipment that you can listen to your music everywhere.
"One can create multiple play list, and each with different type of music. Very flexible and intuitive menus and more"
"Well designed app, great music and podcasts. I appreciate how well it is put together!"
great way to choose music to suit your mood
"I left Spotify for about 2 months to try Amazon music. Worst app for music and now back using Spotify again. Doesn't crash, doesn't pause for laooding each song streaming, doesn't require restarts multiple times."
If it ain't broke don't fix it. I stand by this. So don't go messing with the UI now we've all gotten used to it lol
"The only drawback is that the app doesn't allow to go to the previous track (if i use a headphone/earphone that has only one button) When i actually use the one button earphone it works by pressing twice to forward to the next track, press thrice to go to the previous track, press once it pauses the song and so on. Please developers make this option available. Thanksüëçüèº"
Best UI experience for any Music app out there
The best music app ever. Very intuitive
"What is there NOT to Like?? -- This app is Very Intuitive as to what I am thinking, what I want, & when I want it, -- wish I Could say the Same About my Girlfriend. Lol"
"I absoloutely love Spotify, It's so easy to use, it's quick to work etc. You can listen anywhere, and if you buy Premium the whole experience is even better. Everything you would want to litsen to is on here. 10/10 would recommend. I love listening to music on here:) The only thing that could use improving is the amount of adverts for people without Premium. There's quite a lot of them. Apart from that, it is absoloutely perfect."
please revert the play button placement ..
"I like this app very much. But unfortunately, I pressed the button that puts the song in the TV. And I didn't want that to happen. But now it's all good. So, thanks for making this app awesome!"
Excellent!!! I ‚ù§ myself some Spotify music! I can fix my music to suit my listening ear. I ‚ù§ it. Try it for yourself.
Why can't I access the search button easily in my liked songs section without having to scroll all the way up to search?
It great state of the arts ingenuity that makes the app one of the best that has verities selections.
"Great app. Has almost all the songs I look for. Their premium family plan is so so worth it. There's absolutely no restrictions on playlists and other such organisations for the paid plan. Useful features are added quite frequently. Love the swipe to add to queue feature. Song and playing radios, and other song suggestions are quite apt"
"It's awesome experience,it is on point when it comes to fresh music üé∂ no hustle just a ticky of a button"
Ez to use and very quick app
"Best music app, i have ever use. I really loved the design and specially that almost every song has a lyrics. The fun thing is that it helps of make playlist share with friends and families and it also has a option to keep it private. I love this app"
Mind blowing app my all favouite song available in this app
"For the most part, and I mean about 95% of the time, I don't have any issues. Only issues I have are typically with the connection and the program saying there is no internet connection when there is, but the issues is typically solved fairly quick."
"The App is easy to use, the algorithm also sorts out your song preferences very well. Its GUI is also pretty impressive. The premium version is top notch perfect"
"It's a music app. You can build your library from literally thousands of titles and a multitude of bands across every genre. Small detail is you have to be a paying subscriber to download and play offline. In these times money for a lot of us doesn't come easily, and there are more important things to deal with."
"I use Spotify Premium, and it's great value for money. Spotify has a diverse range of curated playlists, making it easy for you to find the musical genres that you enjoy. It's also clever enough to make playlists designed just for you, based on what you typically listen to. It has never been easier for me to discover new artists and songs that I love!"
So easy to choose music and is so guick
"Been with spotify for 4 years and I am quite fortunate to have had no issues, so new users come on board the spotify train."
Just love the vibes and ui of this app. Plus the audio quality and music recommendations and the overall user experience it's top tier. Just love this app
"Spotif is indeed the best, i play all my music on this app, it's really enjoyable, no ads disturbing the music, it's really quite interesting"
Getting the song to play is as easy as pressing a play button on your music system. THE SONGS PLAY VERY CLEARLY. ITS SURPRISING. KEEP UP THE GOOD QUALITY WORK
Easy and quick to use. Keeps my job tolerable. Thank you!
A paid user No problem in streaming But new update with play/pause button at left corner isn't a good UI . You are spotify man. Maintain the simplicity.
"Youtube(regular) along with this, gives the best music content . Before I started using this app, I had a horrible time finding songs as the only website/app where I found a good collection of music was YouTube. This still doesn't have all the songs by all the artists(some are country restricted ) but I feel that it still has quite a major collection. Edit: I tried premium and honestly, there isn't much difference in audio quality a... Thankfully, I've only opted for the 3 month free offer..."
It's a great app...easily one of my favourite music apps but it's got some bugs...sometimes ads appear and the dismiss button doesn't work and you have to restart the app and sometimes it consumes a huge load of data and memory than usual...overall it's an awesome app .... would recommend to everyone....!!
It require 5 stars first if we want to listen song and then was amazing app
Best music streaming platform I've used such a clean UI and easy to use I recommend Spotify
Easy to use UI and great music selection.
I quite enjoy Spotify and its wide range of music genres. I also like the option of downloading songs so that I am able to listen to music offline when I am taking a walk.
Love being able to listen to the artists and songs I like and then building a playlist off of that. Nice job
"I absolutely love this app.For sure, it's the best music streaming app there is.From the sleek UI to the crisp and beautiful audio, the app is simply a work of art."
"This is very best platform for listening quick songs. Whole world's songs are available here. Spotify doesn't take big internet data and songs play easily. But, Spotify subscription is very expensive."
Best ever ui .please some less ads. I love it
"Has been great, using this app. Imo, I prefer the older version of the app, I do Not like the updated UI."
I love the app and I even subscribe to premium but the latest updates caused some inconveniences. Why remove the fast scroll function on the right side of the screen. I believe there is no reason to completely remove a very useful function. The experience when browsing without fast scroll is horrible by having to swipe countless times in a playlist with over a thousand songs. The addition of quick access to search is quite nice but it defeats the purpose when it doesn't play the playlist.
Directs one quickly to music without undergoing many steps
Exceptional experience. Well designed. Great collection of music. Couldn't ask for better.
It is the best music listening app even if you don't have spotify premium you can fade into songs the audio quality is amazing when I have my airpods on I can hear I guitar on one ear and Other instrument in my Other ear I recommend you buying this.
Genuinely very useful and entertaining app...
The latest album art updated design with curved edges is horrifying. Pointed edges looked amazing and flat. Pls roll back.
My experience with Spotify has been great. I love that you can download and listen offline and the amount of content on this music app is quite expansive.
An exceptional excellent app which has potential to create great history in different applications of musical industry. By improving one of the quality is uninterruptible adds service provision. Thanks. Best of luck for future goals and variable characteristics that would be brought to enhance its genuine authenticity.
"It's the best music streaming service out there, especially if you're a student! The only real downside with this service is that it doesn't have HIFI support that it's competitors like Tidal have. But excluding that, it's a great service that has a very wide selection of artists and a great UI."
"i love spotify but this update is so uglyyyyyy, recently my app has been showing the play button and the skip/replay buttons differently and it bothers me so much because it doesnt rlly make sense to change the basic set up of any music app"
Quick tip: The free version is quite literally unusable
Perfection. I use this app as a student. I use the free version and I don't know why I don't get the ads. I never saw them in the app. It's an excellent app for a student and also for other age groups. I listen to the music to concentrate in my studies and listen to podcasts too. I think it's the best music app. UI and UX is nice. Till now no complaint. It has many tremendous features for free no other free music app gives you. You can go for it! Satisfied üòå üëç.
Would love this app even more if they came out with a 5x1 widget to fit my screen and maybe song facts on already downloaded songs with no internet required üòâ. Other than that I love it üòÅ
LOVE it! Listen whenever we are on our golf cart (which is quite often)üòäüéÜ
This app was the beater thing I ever had it is good than any other app other apps are fake they think they are 4.8 they are not they play your voice messages dont download them spotify is better as you can listen to good tracks like tranquility(my favourite)by m huncho and you can connect to your xbox
"Great app - just a few problems and I know the answer to one of them; 1) on Apple devices there is a loop button that should be on android that isn't here 2) please don't add songs to small playlists, it can be annoying. 3) add the loop/able to change where in song you're at and able to chose what song is played; HOWEVER these options work when opened while another device such as a computer already has Spotify open. Besides this, great app!!! üòÅ"
"Thank you for adding lyrics. Now you are really the best for me !!! P.S. please, put play button in the middle again, it's very inconvenient"
"I'm totally agreeing it's a great app for my swingy moods,,,,,,,,I still remember the day when I didn't find any suitable app for my choice of music ,,,,,,then I got it ,,,,,,,it's provides you variety of music of every genre,,,,,,,and also provides podcasts that helps you to know yourswlf in a better way,,,,,,so download it and enjoy what you love"
Spotify is the best music and podcast platform web design is easy to use and no hassle payment at a reasonable cost. Keep up the Awesome work!!!üëçüòäüòä
"The functionality of Spotify on devices such as Android Mobile,and Amazon Tv is excellent! there's a wide variety of music for everyone,creating playlists is simple,quick,convenient and multiple versions of the Spotify interface are user friendly tooüëç"
Best app around for building playlists and listening ad free. I've tried them all but Spotify is number one for me.
"Free or Premium, definetly the best music app provinser, with a simple and mest design"
Affordable and has every playlist I searched for. The only set back is I can't put a timer so the music can stop playing after a designated time.
Top tunes at the touch of a few buttons.
Great options. Intuitive and easy to use
I will be a loyal customer. Very intuitive and easy to navigate.
"Music content and quantities, and UI/Ux is better here. Spotify also gives better recommendations."
I'm enjoying itüëçüëåüëåüëå. I'm not having any discontinuity or noise while hearing Spotify music.
"My stress reliever, my addiction, to be honest this is my true love, at the end I'll be like "" it started in 2019 and Now it's 2050 am 45. And my love is yet not gone for you (spotify) "" üòÇüòÇ The way App is designed is comfortable for me to access the color gives me some kind of warm feel and lot more good things to state ,my only problem is ads"
Please put the pause button back where it belongs...
"Great app, only wish I could use the volume buttons to switch between music Edit: Going several years strong and 700 liked songs with Spotify now, there's really not anything else as good, just wish certain songs were on it, but the local file import feature is awesome for songs not on here. Also, I don't really care about the volume button thing, it's kind of a moot point now lol."
"Once I bought premium, it was just luxury listening. Sheer brilliance in the recommended playlists. I couldn't have paid less for such an experience, magical."
I am a frequent Spotify USA listener and also a Premium member Your app is exquisite as always A big Thanks to your universally vast music archives and artist selections But as I also subscribed and use the YouTube Music unlimited subscription App it sounds better when you compare the audio quality to Spotify apps music quality Could it be because that app costs more per month?? Anyway Spotify is too good
"Really, it's like all the other ones out there that I've tried, they all have there quirks and sometimes issues but it is what it is. But I do prefer it over Pandora."
"Nice seeing some recent work for android. Swipe to queue, and love the new squiggle progressbar"
"One of the only services left where I can freely create, listen, and build playlists new and old."
When I pause the song with earphone button while the phone is locked the song did not resume when I again press the button
"I'm a premium member and for a good price, we have so many great features. I pledge my customer loyalty to Google but sadly Youtube music doesn't suit the standards of what music apps should be e.g Spotify."
My requirment of music ls limited to the time of walking and exercise. Plenty of Choice and quality of music is very good.
"Best app experience, the UI is very simple & easy to use. The app runs smooth at all times & up to this far I haven't experienced any glitches."
I love this app! I love the collab playlist feature too. I think somthing that could be added to make it even better would be a way to replay a certain part of a song. I know some people just want to hear a certain part of a song over and over. Maybe hit a button on the menu when you look at a song and adjust the sides of the time bar to decide what portion of the song you wanna hear on loop. I love this app and I go to youtube when I want to hear a part of a song on loop.
"I used to listen for Music through YouTube apps for almost whole day before I met this app, when I moved to here, I got some great experience from UX and UI inside this app, everything's great and I believe it could beaten Apple Music (iTunes) popularity becaused what we found in here was so close to what we felt in Apple Music apps (In listening musics experience, UI and UX too) eventough wasn't the best in his line but at least we could find the same between both..."
"I don't like music, but, I do like podcasts at times, so for that it's good. 'Queuing up' audios is a conveniant feature. Nothing much to say, very good app that's all. :D Oh and the recommendations are precise according to one's taste."
Besides the ads....I'm quite happy with this app considering it is a free one.
"Really good for casual listeners , one of the best features and the feature to difficult ui ratio is also kinda high so yeah it's the best"
Has all the songs you can ever want / think of. You can comolie your own personal playlists or follow playlists that suit your music taste. Good music app 10/10
"App keeps freezing and shows ""no internet connection"" in the recent update despite full wifi connection. This is a bug. It leads to thumbnails of the albums songs playlists not being displayed. I need to quit spotify, clear recent apps and reopen spotify several times to fix the issue. The audio also stop playing randomly."
I'm new to Spotify and only just became a premium member so I'm still going off of my three month trial but already looking forward to my first payment. Everything I have heard about Spotify is true ! The designers and creators of this app know their stuff and must love music themselves. Cheers to the designers of Spotify I am a very happy Spotify customer and definitely won't be cancelling my sevice for a very long time if at all. Thanks to the team for creating one of the best music apps ever!
This is actually cool but the repeat button is gone
"I love Spotify..it delivers on what it says it delivers on.No problems there..my only problem with it though is why the app is not allowed to run in background if you remove it from your recent apps..i mean i used to use deezer before and it worked seamlessly like that, no issues..i just want to be able to choose music i want to listen to and then listen to it without having to not mistakenly remove it from my recents.. I'm used to do that with all my apps and so it ruins the experience for me"
My favorite music app by far. One of the very few subscriptions that I enjoy paying. I've literally convinced my whole household of it's glory. Spotify's interface is probably one of the most intelligent designs I've had the pleasure to toggle with. I love you Spotify. I truly do. I use this app all day long and all night. It is the digital Adderall to my all to real ADHD.
Best music platform I've used. Thats not saying much tho. The only thing I hate is one cant thumbs DOWN a song to remove it quickly. Wish they would add that
This app is quick and easy to use if you understand... But this is one of the best music apps I know in my opinion...keep on with the lovely apps üëå
Absolutely brilliant. Never had problems with it. Quick and easy to use. Love the playlists option where you can make your own. Pay for the premium. Best ¬£10 a month I spend for no adverts.
Good music streaming service with user-friendly UI. Not encounter any bug so far...so i gave 5 stars for now.
My absolute favorite app and most used app that's worth every penny for the membership cost! I use Spotify every single day and love how it recommends and creates mixes of songs designed just for you. My favorite feature that came through a couple updates back shows the song lyrics if you click on them while it's playing and I'm so grateful for this feature!! Love Spotify and will be a lifelong customer!
UI is lo minimal and easy to use. Should give option to download songs individually.
Just an fantastically designed app. Really well done.
"I do love Spotify! Even pay for no ads, some days the app is finicky but gets resolved pretty quickly so no complaints here üëç"
"This is the best music streaming app of √†ll time. Fantastic UI is there. Everything is great. But you can make downloading songs available for the free version, but I know it is the reason for subscription but you can make it."
Best music streaming platform. I love how it organizes my favorite tracks in my own personal category Spotify has got to be the best music streaming platform ever. Especially now that they sync with Samsung music on Samsung devices you won't have drag of going to download music on other apps on Play store but I wish that they could have made a play next button on listening to offline music.
The music is amazing there's a free and when I mean free I mean FREE 15 day without adds which I love but there's ads after there very quick tho so if you like music I would recommend
Best steaming service by far. Only two small complaints with the UI. Only complaint is the settings menu. It's hard to find and can only be accessed from the main screen instead of from everywhere
"I had issues with my app on my phone so I emailed and it was fixed so quickly, same day I emailed. Great customer service :)"
"""SEE UPDATE"" Thank you for fixing this application it is better than the previous 3 updates. It is back working near on perfectly. Great looking UI, nice, clean,, easy to navigate with probably the most extensive library of music from any provider. *UPDATE* downgraded to 1 star from 5 as album art is missing from all of the downloaded albums. *UPDATE* cleared cache and uninstalled and installed fresh and everything appears to be working okay again, fingers crossed that it retains the album art."
"Excellent music app, the new design finally works flawlessly and am having 0 problems with it. Thank you!"
Best streaming platform for music lovers with premium UI
"The sound world in palm of your hand. Quick, objective, and Incredible."
This app is actually good so far and I'm new I started 2 or 4 days ago and so far it's doing great but there is a issue there is not a speed up button so I can speed it up I would love to speed up the music I'm hearing .the audio is pretty good and if your wondering Spotify let's you listen while offline unlike YouTube music.
"Quite convenient,and global in tast of music and sounds"
"Good quality audio files ! To give you all round experience of music , selection of music is quite decent , but some genres needs more content!"
"Brilliant, intuitive and smooth"
"All the music I want at the press of a button or two. It's brilliant, thanks."
Love the library you can build and the depth of choices but miss Neil and Joni
Intuitive to my musical taste. Easy to use. Simply the best!
love itt maybe cut the ads for free or have a skip button for ads like how youtube music has and your rates probably will go even higher no disrespect by the way <33
"I love this app. It gives great music and I love that you can see some playlist others design. And the fact that you can find more music like the music you like. Also, I can exit the app while listening and that's what makes me appeciate this app. Also the ads are a good amount reasonable and also there are plans without ads.üòÖ‚úåÔ∏èüèæ"
Been using this from 2019.. It's the best music streaming app.. the UI is user friendly both mobile and PC.. only complain is ad but if you have premium then all sorted!
"Finally! An app that has all my music, and an Uncluttered, Elegant GUI. Well worth a few c3nts a day."
c'est tr√®s sympa et j'aime apprendre une chanson intitul√©e blue eyes c'est TR√àS sympa donc c'est pourquoi je lui ai donn√© 5 d√©parts :) (it is very nice and i like to leson to a song called blue eyes is VERY nice so thats why i gave it a 5 starts:))
Great. Not impressed with ads built in to podcasts though. I pay premium to avoid these intervals
"I love Spotify it allows me to listen to all different types of music to suit my mood or vibe each day. I'm constantly finding songs I enjoy listening to from Spotifys recommendations & play list, made just for me I then add them to my own play list."
Love spotify! Very intuitive algorithm.
"Spotify is the best app ever! It made me thankful for living in this era of time. I really love how the algorithm knows which genre and mood to choose for me based on only one song I search for! I love the Daily Mixes and the recommendations, the huge number of playlists and categories, the design and user experience, and a lot more features. Thank you for this"
"i love this app, the automatic playlists based on your listening history ,music recommendations so so user intuitive"
I still can't play some songs even though I paid for. Premuim please give some response!!
I love ‚ù§Ô∏è this app a lot because it has a best collection it has a collection of all song around the world and recommendations of this app is superb it makes perfect blend of your favourite beats I use this app mostly than other social media apps 'cause of its perfect UI than other music apps I personally think that the Spotify is the best platform for streaming online songs sometimes for free accounts adds irritates the most but In-spite of this It match with my all expectations perfectly.
"The horrible, invasive and insidious power of ads. I never understood how tranquil listening to podcasts was until these tv like ads now invade your senses. Typical ads, they are done in such a way to provoke your senses, even insult them with annoying, disingenuous voices that linger long after the ad is over. The reason is so you'll remember the ad, they make an absolute prostitution of your attention. Will this be like YouTube soon where extreme censorship came down on all content?"
"Great app, especially on PC because there's less ads. On Mobile it's not bad either, the 30-Minute Ad-Free Video that you get certainly makes it better and more bearable. Hopefully in the future once I get a steady job I will get myself that sweet, juicy premium that I've been wanting to get."
Bestest app for all the songs It requires less internet speed it also works on that It gives the best sound quality I prefer you to plzz download it nd use it then plzz give us a good review
"Great experience, just built and downloaded my first playlist after subscribing for my 3 month premium free access."
"Spotify is my only go to when listening to music at home, away and in the car. The songs that you select after my list is finished is a great idea as quite a few I have added to my list."
"Intuitive app, without many ads and the original podcasts are very good"
"I've been using premium for 2 years now, and right now the app is better than ever. All the compact design, easy to navigate functions, I just love to use Spotify."
"Its quite lovely, paid subscriber for over ten years. Did not disappoint."
I've had Spotify for 3 years now and I love it. Awhile back I had some issues with the web player version of it but after a time of little to no use from the app it fixed itself and now works wonderfully and gives me everything I need at the click of a button.
"""...loading more music than Pandora"" and you weren't kidding! Lyrics to almost every song at least that I've noticed little video background to each song best artist backgrounds and bios you just can't get any more informative and better than this I've learned so much things about music and songs I've loved that I never would have known like certain guitarists and people collaborating with this person to create this song on this album never would have known..."
Excellent music app that builds a Playlist based on what you like. Love that feature! üëç
"It has been quite eventful, it has an efficient algorithm."
"Haven't gone the whole hog with spottify yet they have a really great range of music, that suits my appetite .. top marks üôÇ"
Highly recommended from the UI to the AI Amazing recommendations of songs And UI is easy to use and feels modern
Gui nice. Good menus. Usually works. Stop broadcast to my radio app for Spotify. But 5 stars nonetheless.
Best app .. song you can choose according to your mood ! And can save them also ! Required less data
"You guys at Spotify are great! You have made Spotify irresistible; it is now the greatest streaming service indeed! Device music playback, lyrics, beautiful UI etc it's beautiful!"
Latest update is really buggy on Android. It keeps disconnecting and it doesnt show on a locked screen quite often. Spotify is the best music streaming app out there
Quick and easy I just love the classics
"I'm always able to find whatever song I want at the moment, no matter how obscure, and Spotify makes it really easy to build my own playlist."
I listen to music all day every day and this gets the job done with an easy to use UI and sharing with friends.
"Love the app, I have used it for years but recently the mini player within the has disappeared and no really way to see what's playing,pause or skip tracks and I'm also have the problem of having to close down all apps when disconnecting aux from car because music keeps playing on phone. Spotify is this a bug from recent update or ......?"
"Need a little development like the app is so boring and if you want some advice on the design Contact me I will do it for for 10$ and if you implement it I want 1500$, deal? Is fun you know."
I have been using spotify for years I love it. One change I would like is a second like button that will not automaticaly add the song to a play list. Then spotify could make me better playlists without my main favorites growing so large.
Best musicentertainment streaming platform out there! You can really train the algorithm to suit your tastes ave you'll never run out of new music too listen to free or premium.
"I find this app quite good. I use it almost on a daily basis, and is very enjoyable. And for a very cheap price you can upgrade to premium and get no adds. Even with ads, it is still very enjoyable, and I highly recommend it."
Best music streaming service out there IMO. The app is very easy to use. Everything is very smooth and fluid. The playlists are pretty accurate most of the time. Sound quality its excellent. A paid subscription makes the experience even better.
quickly fixed the bugs brought on by the latest update after being notified! back to being an easy to use app.
"Its such a wonderful experience to have spotify ive tried other apps. But this is the best one yet ive had this account now for 5+years and love it . only small request, when weekly discovery comes out, if we have already hit the dont like button please dont send those same songs again maybe by different artists ok but the same song and artist, that does get old."
It can create playlist and add downloaded songs to playlists and there is a button where you get free premium no credit card needed for 4 months
"I cannot spend a single day without Spotify. I do not buy Premium subscriptions for anything, but I promise you that Spotify Premium is not a luxury, but a necessity. I will always recommend using Spotify, it is the best app for people who have music running in their blood."
Over time I have asked for some quite unusual music. It has played it every time. Never let me down.
"UI is a mess at the moment, does not show which song is playing and gets stuck on a song. Pretty frustrating."
"I love this app so much! But there's 1 thing I need to complain, I have Spotify installed on my phone and tablet. In my tablet I can edit the songs order in a playlist but in my phone, I don't see the option to edit the song order, why is that? I'm going to sell my tablet and I'm afraid I can't arrange the songs order anymore, plus I don't have a PC or Laptop to do so. Maybe kindly add an arrange button on my phone too? That would be great, thank you."
"I have been using Spotify for a few years now and have been pleased with the overall user experience and interface. I love that not only can find a variety of podcasts and music, Spotify recommends similar podcast topics and songs based on what I listen to, which only makes driving even more enjoyable. I also appreciate that I can be listening to something on my phone and then switch on my laptop / Smart TV and continue listening there. Great Job, Spotify! üíö"
Yooo! the pause button is bugged and and when i get on the app it the play bar at the bottom doesn't show as if im not listening to anything.
"The app used to be great but recent updates have caused issues with connectivity and playback buttons dissappearing! I now have to close the app to stop music. Wonderful. Surprising though, that there are no issues with billing whatsoever!"
One big problem right now is I can't see the player button in my app. So I play music by click on song and I can't see the button for stop/play music or skip. Why is that?
"Very well arranged , suitable for all ages , Choice And Music."
Great UI. I like how I can finally have all my favourite songs in one place regardless of when it came out
"The latest release it's causing a bug on my Samsung M31. Everytime I use Spotify and play a song, the ""window"" containing play/pause button (and where I can click to open lyrics) disappear. I've already tried to clear data, cache and even reinstall the app, without success. Sorry if anything looks confuse, still improving my English. Thanks from Brazil. ( I will change the 1-star when this is properly solved )"
Spotify premium (duo) suits all my needs.
"The app is user friend, fantastic ui look and great user experience, üëåüèø"
"it's worth it to pay for premium honestly. and there are ton of different plans for different situations. It's probably the best streaming app out there. it has quite a lot of bugs, especially with Bluetooth but usually just restarting the app fixes it so it's not really an issue. Some albums went missing for some reason (WHAT. -Bo burnham for example) but it came back, so I don't have reason to complain."
"I use to love this app, but that's been ruined,can't even get my phone to connect to my old account"
"I wish the system was more fluid and smooth like IOS swiping down on a song to move on to other things like finding new songs, playlists, etc. Other than that, its almost perfect UPDATE: THEY FINALLY DID IT. FIVE STARS"
I love Spotify! It has all the songs I will probably ever listen to. The UI is wonderful and easy to maneuver around.
The music options are pretty much endless when it comes to Spotify. It is only $10 a month for unlimited streaming but the free version is also nice. I love the design and the overall look of the app. It is simple and easy to manage my playlists and podcasts as well.
"Spotify finally listened and added swipe to queue on Android. Finally! I'm not the biggest fan of how it looks, I preferred the slightly blocky design, but the fact that swipe to queue is now a thing makes it all good."
Well organized intuitive interface.
"Exceptional. Been With Spotify For Years. Love That They Don't Up Their Charges Once You Subscribe To Premium. As A Musician & A Person That Treats Music Like It's A My Pulse. Spotify Gets Invested In Their Subscribers, Whether It's From ""Summer Rewind"",""Most Listened To Artist"" To ""A Quick Mix Of Songs You Forgot"". 5 Stars & Highly Recommended."
It's the best music app I have ever used it has everything you name it they got it I am I am an old school rocker they got all my high school favorites quiet riot wasp AC/DC Judas priest just to name a few
They should make this app adv free. Sometimes it just annoys the mood. Music shouldn't interfere buisness it should be free for everyone.
"I love spotify so much, but the last two days I haven't been able to skip a song like a normally can. The play/pause buttons and the skip forward backwards buttons are just not appearing."
i love it the only thing i would fix is spotify emailing me about there preuim... Otherwise it is AWSEOME i think it is awseome cuz all the songs are FREE :) if u are thinking of getting spotify plzzzzz follow me at _Isabelle_Sandler_ Thxssss
"The following review is coming from a hardcore audiophile. I've been using Spotify for the last 2 years but didn't get the premium since I believed it was too expensive for just listening to audio. Many times I had thought of switching to other music apps, but once you go Spotify you won't go back. No other music app can hold a candle to Spotify in terms of UI, recommendations and music stock. Eventually I subscribed to the student premium using my stipend money. I haven't regretted it since."
Spotify isn't playing any of my songs the timer is stuck at 0:00 but it is showing that the play button is on but no sounds are coming I have tried clearing cache reinstalling i have enough space but nothing is working worst app.
"Love the endless selection of all my favorites, especially when traveling. Navigate to the right corner to the ‚Äúlyrics button‚Äù and select if you want to enable Lyrics. Pretty cool feature üëçüèø"
The UI experience is very exceptional
"awesome app. I have the premium version which I buy every month. There is one thing that bothers me. When I'm playing my playlist on shuffle, and I hear a song I like, but I hit the button to go to the next song by accident. So I click the back button to go to the previous song, but it doesn't let me..."
"Almost always has the music I want, I enjoy the playlists created for me. The free version is okay as long as you have a stable connection. Had to unsubscribe for a bit due to financial reasons and the cancellation process was effortless and quick. All in all it's a great application and I will continue using it. It works well on my phone and PC."
"A music platform that is so extensive you'll never be bored; its got something everyone. Filled with the old, new and yet to be discovered diamonds in the rough. The muisc just goes on and on."
"The BEST music streaming service. The UX is on point. I tried Apple music and Deezer, and always keep coming back."
"I like that I can press the power button to switch of the screen, and the podcasts still play even though I don't use the premium version."
"Great app I am very pleased,pls don't make any changes, bcos if you do you will ruin this wonderful experience I have right now. This app deserves 5 stars from me great job"
Spotify displays lyrics for most songs that accurately match up with the vocals. High audio quality and smooth UI.
Still the largest selection of music. Opens quickly with 0 bugs or lag.
"I love that you can make a playlist, and hit the enhance button, and it pops up a bunch of new music like the songs on that playlist. I love finding new music all the time, and i feel like spotify helps with that. so much to chose from."
"Best audio quality, nice collection, simple and great UI, but some of the international artists are not available for india thats why I gave it 4 stars. But now its worthy for 5 Stars. Please launch Spotify HiFi in India."
"I've had Spotify since 2016 and I upgraded to Spotify Premium in 2020 and I honestly enjoy the app. Yes there are the obvious downsides yet all apps have pros and cons to them. I really enjoy not being hounded by ads every two-three songs and I can actually play what I want, despite a few of my favorite songs being unavailable to listen to I still find the vast amount of choices to be enjoyable. The new UI is easy to use and it doesn't take a lot of time to get yourself set up I enjoy Spotify"
"Spotify is amazing! The family option is really cheap, which is great. But there's something wrong with my Playlist, i wqnt the Playlist to run in order, not shuffled. I didn't use the shuffle button."
Fantastic app with great algorithms for finding the sounds that suit you. Also the Spotify Wrapped thing is amazing
Audio randomly cuts off and doesn't continue once the screen switches off - poor design.
"Spotify is exceptionally well made! I haven't found anything in this app that is in need of correction. Seamlessly intuitive and remarkable, that sums it up in my opinion."
I can not tell you how much this app has inspired me from day to day! I get up every morning and plan on being more productive than the day before. And even just taking showers I go from just a blah day to an absolute happy day in the span of 5 minutes!!!! So if you have not gotten Spotify yet I encourage you to go on your mobile devices and download it as quickly as possible. Because this app has changed my life and can do the same for you guys!!!!
"The app is very intuitive to the listener and seems to have an unlimited amount of genre, recommendations, and diversity. Keep up the good work Spotify!"
"Wow gr8, Just please make very interactive UI design for Spotify"
Easy to set up and quick response
Love the extensive music Spotify kept me up to date with. Very hard to quit after I have tried it.
Love being able to save my own play list. No matter what genre I want to listen to Spotify has the recordings built into the program of the songs I like. Thank you Spotify for giving me the freedom of choosing my music.
"I'm enjoying the 3 free months. I've even able to create my own playlist with tons of songs that I'm ashamed I know... I'm almost 40, in about 3 years but some of the songs like the TLC songs that included Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes do not compare to the stuff being pushed out now... Good good app to feel good to. Who's paying for this? (CQuinnzDaily on Instagram)"
"I love to listen to music on spotify it is really nice but I just have one problem, why is there no repeat button for me?"
Fantastic app. Being an afificiando of music it was a real pain having to look for the covers and different versions of my favourite songs. Spotify you can quite easily get what you're looking for and find stuff you didn't know existed. Keeps the soul well fed.
"Its a good little app, no problems with it. Just wish I could export liked song to a playlist of it own without having to manually build it by and add each song thats already in a list."
Love the app. It could use a GUI polishing but the functionality of the app is fantastic.
I love Spotify and music to list to the muisc.
Very nice. Just improve on the search engine as it requires you to be correct on your search query for you to get what you want.
I've had Spotify over apple music for years now and I'm loving the updates they've been releasing. All I'm waiting for now is a way to quickly filter to the clean version of songs. If there is a way anyone knows about please let me know. Still 5 stars for me.
I do like how easy it is to build a song list or find someone else's list that works great. I like the fun interface and the yearly sign up that gives me a discount.
"Spotify is best to be used on a Tablet or consoles like Xbox or Playstation so you can have more freewill choosing songs you love, unlike in the phone versions where you are required to choose a playlist to play with a six song free skip every 30 minutes."
"Its intuitive, easy to use, and the algorithm is amazing"
Best music streaming app. Easy to access and really good UI. Lot of room to create and asset playlists. Suggesting playlist from the app is really good too.
"Has the Range of music, suitable for all age groups & also for situations."
Very good apart from the ads every two songs...can we not make it 4/5 really ruins the vibe
"Pretty great, haven't noticed anything wrong with the mobile version. Would be great to have a built in equalizer on the PC, but there's already one on mobile."
"Love it!! It has virtually every obscure artists that I love and every great guitarist popular and not so popular that I could ever want to follow including some of the people I take lessons from on YouTube, really a fantastic service and you get a lot for free, I can't recommend this enough to my family and friends"
"Genuinely love the app, have found so Manny great artists, of course there's ads so if u don't want those pay but the app makes me so happy"
I expressed concerns about my account being hacked and they quickly responded by logging me out of all my accounts so that I could download and create a new password for my account. I was impressed.
Great app . Loads up quickly and selection response is quick. Very well set up.
"Had Amazon Music. This is a definite upgrade. I am a Gen X guy, so I am still figuring it all out, but it's really intuitive. I hear ya, ""Ok Boomer..."" I am not THAT old. Pretty old though. What were we talking about?"
Needs to have a speed button thing so you can make your music faster or slower.
"UPDATE: You guys fixed the issue! Thanks a lot! I love the app in general and the service behind it. One thing you needd to look into: once the user uses Android in dark mode, Spotify apps control and slider graphics are vanished from the UI. Or at least that's how it seems. Fix this please!"
"Conistently enjoyable premium experience. Any issues I've had were quickly resolved. I do wish some of the UI options were a bit less confusimg and hidden away. Oherwise, a great app."
Spotify I love you. I am a loyal subscriber. When you're at the song/album/artist main screen there should be a inconspicuous button for the artist. üëåü§ô
Absolutely an incredible app! Thanks Bill Simmons for guiding me here with your must hear Ringer Podcasts üòÅüòÅüòÅ
"I'm OK with the hole experience, I would love to have the lyrics available, I don't really care that much about the story behind the songs. Just give me the plain lyrics. Additional to this, there seems to be no feedback button."
"so so good. i've been using spotify for years and it's genuinely changed who i am as a person. i have access to so many different songs across so many different genres, and the user interface is just out of this world. 10/10 would recommend"
"I must say that for the last couple of months the app has been improved quite noticebly. Devs implement better playlist management (ability to add track to the queue with single quick swipe, ability to add an entire playlist to another playlist), interface works smoother and more responsive. There are still lags, but I see improvment. Lags weren't addressed for months now and got even worse. Finally I see some work done to fix them so I've updated my review from 3 to 5 stars."
"Music recommendations algorithm - 10/10 UI needs some work- An example: can't swipe down to bring down the 'Now playing screen' and reaching for the top most times be stressful. Another: The status bar isn't transparent, makes the whole app look weird, like it was designed poorly But in general- Really really good"
Better than ever. Enhance button for Playlist is good for discovering new songs
"Irritating that it frequently glitches, at the end of or in the middle of songs or podcasts, and requires restart of the app or entire phone."
This app named Spotify is a good app for listening to music üé∂ . I have so many music that I like I have to search the music in the search button. But now I can listen music without searching by putting my song in the liked song. It is a very good application to listen music I rated this app 5 star because this is a very good and perfect app for listening music..
"The menu button does not load and keeps telling me to ""go online to see menu"" even though I am online and streaming music. This issue persists regardless on my wifi and mobile data connection. Very unreliable loading for this menu makes it difficult to edit my queue or set a sleep timer."
More than just listening to your favourites it's the best service for finding similar music. Just has a really good algorithm. Plus the app has many features many other players/services I've tried either don't have or aren't as intuitive. Edit: This is how it is for Premium. I wouldn't recommend using it on a free account. It's plagued with long ads I think more as a nuisance to coerce you into getting premium plus you can only listen to shuffled songs which is almost useless.
I love spotify and I do not have preminum but that doeset matter to me because I still love this app. And it has so many different podcasts and types of muisc and thousands of songs. I love how you can make playlists and stuff and I also love how you can donload podcasts without preminium. I totally recomend this app and I am being one hundred precent honest. You need spotify in your life.
Perfect! Free with No ads. Build your own playlist. They have pre made playlists based off your preferences. I absolutely love Spotify and I'm not going to another app!
Spotify is the perfect application for Music streaming. Very simple but equipped with all the features you will need in a streaming application.
"This is a rewrite and reaffirmation of the quality of this application; if you're a music lover, then Spotify is for you. This app was designed for music first and foremost, and premium subscribers (like myself) have gotten many years of good times via music through its interface and discover weekly (without the ads that hamper the free users experience). The most recent controversy trying to take down Spotify is unconvincing for me; this is not a platform, but THE platform for music/podcasts.‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Excellent player. Would you mind thinking about placing the three dot button on the top right corner on the bottom, under the play / pause button? It might simplify things for bigger screen users üôèüèΩ. Thank you for making it better with every update."
"Some UX and design decisions bother me, but it is still my go-to music listening solution. Edit: After years and years of waiting, they added the swipe to queue gesture iPhones had for ages. Finally. :)"
I love Spotify! It even lets you use different screens on your phone while listening with no inturruptions and with any paid subscriptions. Also.. Very intuitive...
"Listen to your music will a full on emersive experience, they create specific playlists for you, where you can descover new music, or you can create your own playlists and have them designed how you like, Spotify is the best place to get your music and it is loved by so many."
Spotify always works for me when I go to use it and everything is quick to load in
Great UI with exceptional playlists tailored to my preferences.
I use to use apple music/YouTube premium once I switched to Spotify I couldn't go back. I love how easy it is to make Playlist! I've only had one issue within the two years of me using Spotify thar got resolved quickly enough.
"honestly my favorite app. - Contractor that hates commercials/Ads Can you guys please put a quick button to add a song to a playlist? So many great tunes, but a small pain to have to manually add them each time ^^ Thank You! Support Joe Rogan!"
Excellent easy and quick working order
"one of the best if not the best music app around. The UI is great, simple and easy to use. The selection of songs and the playlists that are created most use the music preference of the users.. keep up with the good job."
Such a vast selection of music. Very easy to navigate controls. One of many options is building different libraries.
One of the best app I've ever seen...clean UI and is compatible with my Alexa and Google assistant
I've had premium for quite a while now and it's good. But please add canvas in spotify india. Don't feel like paying anymore for premium if y'all not gonna give it to us
"The best music app anywhere hands down, have used this app for a long while and have never had any problems. Those trolls giving bad reviews who use the free version quit complaining, buy a subscription no ads and great music..."
"Well i like this app good muic im uing for 5 and more years now, if the price dont go up i will keep my subscrition"
This app is easy to understand but the ads sometimes ruin your vibe üòû
Essential option for one's major hobby as a music collector. Developers please ensure that every update retains the button that moves the songs up and down the Library.
Variety of music hence interesting selection that suits the listeners taste and preference.
"Superb. All the music you want on tap for less than the price of a CD every month? Absolute no-brainer. Great for finding new music, old favourites you'd forgotten about, or stuff you had missed at the time.? I'm genuinely puzzled by those who are saying it's slow or crashes and I can only assume it's their phones (I have a relatively powerful Sony Xperia 5 ii) and I've had no issues at all either with logging in or with performance. I honestly can't fault it at all, also switches seamlessly"
"I'm a premium user. And I like the way the app is build . It's very user friendly and the song suggestions an dthe playlists are really good. I really like this app. But there's one thing that i think if implemented in this. It would be good that's reordering the songs in playlist that I made. This is the only missing feature I found. If you can add it, I'd really appreciate that. And you guys have done a great job."
"I was all about every other thing, until a relative shared a song link and I began a wonderful journey through a variety of Hip-Hop tracks. And so came to be my first playlist from liked songs. When I built my own playlists, some enhanced etc., I became hooked. Now I'm playing music all throughout the days, switching playlists based upon mood or location. Overall great üëç‚ö°"
Love the ability to create a playlist song by song or by choosing an artists entire album. I like the similar artist/songs option when your playlist has run its course. Makes building a playlist a little easier as well as finding new music. I wish I could figure out how to combine one playlist with another though.
"Design, sound quality, features , everything is great. I just love it. üíï"
"Love the Permiun Plan. I cant stand when music stops just to play an ad. The continuious play does'nt do thar, its perfect, and the price per month isnt to bad either.."
"2022: works well these days with improved quality 2019:Bad UX and buggy. Sync issues, continuity issues on different devices, button states, disables buttons etc"
"Its a great app (in my opinion) because it doesn't require wifi, I ride on a bus to school and back and I don't have mobile data so it's helpful to have a way to listen to music on a long bus ride. Thanks for reading"
Easy to use. I love the music recommendations when I build a play list.
I am a premium user. Song listings & albums are superb. Collections are super cool. Awesome experience. But still I got a complain. Spotify declares it uses high quality audio but I think Saawan or Gaana holds much better sound quality & clarity. Dev.'s should look for the quality matter & I also think.... Spotify should add a preset equilizer for song varieties.
New to the streaming apps. Enjoying it so far. Building my playlist! üëç
"I can log in and gain streams I am happy now,I love spotify I RECRUIT HOT guys girls using this very app."
M using spotify from many years and m spotify premium user from 2020. Now m facing login issue using facebook which is premium account from yesterday. Now i dont have any clue to login or cancel my subscription. Please guide me
Thus app is amazing it let's you listen to your music. Yes it does have ads every now and then but to honest with you it is quite good I can listen to music perfectly and have to worry about a thing when I'm listening to music. Some people may disagree and that's okay but I just really love this app so I would give it 5 out of 5.
So so good to have such a wide variety of music and podcasts at the press of a button. Really love this app.
"This is such a great music app. It gets customized according to our tastes so flawlessly that the recommendations are so apt for you. The ads were a hurdle at the beginning but once you start using it constantly, the ads gradually decrease. This is the best music streaming app you can ever get and believe me, I HAVE tried out quite a few......."
Awesome algorithm and user experience.
"For me, Spotify is quite awesome."
"A good app not to lie all the song you need are there from the common to the uncommon. But it doesn't have it own download button like Apple music does, if you won't to download one song for an album you will have to download the album and that's not good. Plsssss fix that ok üëç"
"Fully satisfied with UI, sound quality etc. I would like if you add stuff like visualization of sound like in VLC Media Player"
"Amazing , especially device connect ui and system love it whenever go just connect to tv,pc on tho go and speaker switch is awesome man hats off of kn my fav üòç"
"Building playlist on google premium, i dont want commercials."
Love Spotify and they are very helpful and quick to answer enquiries.
"WHAT THE HECK SPOTIFY, I don't like this new UI for the home mobile app, it's bad enough that the recently played is at the home instead of the play queue, I hope you redress this issue NOW!!"
I'm assuming an update ruined my app. There used to be a bar that showed the song that is currently playing and it gave the option to pause the song. The only way for me to stop music from playing right now is to force stop the entire application. Plus I can't even tell what song is playing or who is by unless it's the song I specifically put on. Even then I only know because its the song I requested. Not because the app displays that information.
"Excellent app. Got all I need and much more. Keep up the great work. One snag though, the volume of the tracks on some albums are quite low while most are high. Can this be equalized across all the albums on spotify? Asides this two thumbs up¬ø¬ø‚ñ™ pls add Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five - They Said It Couldn't Be Done album to Spotify."
"Even without premium this app is amazing for songs. Before I downloaded this app (which was 2 years ago now) I would always have trouble remembering all the songs I like, but after downloading this, you can keep all the songs you like, no matter how many, in one place by simply pressing the white outlined heart on a song. The app has all the features you could ever need without premium, no songs require premium to listen to, and you still get 6 skips per hour without premium."
Spotify meets all of my music requirements. A great experience indeed.
Absolutely Amazing app... Its has a Great UI and Flawless streaming experience... Full 5 stars... If there was an option for 6 stars ....then i would vote it full 6 stars
"An excellent choice for your music station and more. With the premium feature - which is quite affordable - you can have the luxury of listening music with style and comfort that makes you enjoy your day more. There are thousands choices of music, artists, genre and playlist that you can choose from and make your own playlist. The joy and comfort of enjoying music at the tip of your finger!"
Issues since the last update on Samsung S21+. The music quits playing in the middle of a song and the music controller on the bottom of the screen in not there to skip songs.
Get variety of all types of music all at one touch of a button
"Great UI and functionality, looking forward to getting Hi-Fi quality tier. One feature suggestion would be sub-playlists (e.g. Metal: [Heavy Metal, Thrash metal, etc])."
"I have premium and I'd recommend it over all others like iTunes music, Pandora, exc. It's great and if you pair it with Shazam you can find new music and get music you are listening to quickly. It has hands free vehicle mode and voice activation also. It's well worth the price"
It's a great streaming platform. There are no glitches and it's easy to order your music in the way you like it. The algorithm also catches on quickly to your taste and suggests music accordingly.
If you can afford the premium Def get it. Free version is just as good minus adds and no back button.
This is a really great app i take the headphones and connect it to mobile and open spotify.. And my favourite rapper emiway buntai and listening his rap and in few hours . I complete my school and tuitions HOMEWORK . THIS A VERY NICE AND MOTIVATIONAL APPüòÅüëåüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
"If you're in an environment where you need to constantly play music, then Spotify is your best option. The app contains tons of playlist that you can choose from to suit your environment."
You can use it to get the podcasts for free. Their music playlists are quite nice. It is a recent discovery that this app is pretty rockin
LOVE this app. Suits all my music needs. Thanks for the amazing app.
Easy to set up for music I like. Have found every song I've looked for very quickly. Saves me storing music on my phone as I have started building a library on the app for instant access. Excellent app.
"4 years of qauilty audio, and an constantly improving system !"
The UI is a little wonky on the tablet (specifically the global nav being on the left hand side of the screen instead of across the bottom) but it is still a great app!
"Love Joe Rogan, and also a pretty good app. Please stop updating so quick tho, barely get used to soemthing before having to change."
"I've been a Spotify member since before 2010, used it on my iphone and now my Google phone. Any issues I have are usually with the Google assistant working with Spotify (ex playing wrong playlist) and my number 1 complaint is if I say ""play daily mix #"" it plays some album from Luis masters. I now hate Luis masters, but if you're not using voice commands it's fine."
Simply functional and intuitive.
"Very easy to use! Nice audio quality and time passer, I know most people don't have the money for premium but I completely recommend it! You get unlimited song skips, offline music listening, (via download button on playlist) next song image preview, better audio quality, ability to listen to songs not in your Playlist fully, and all for $10 CAD a month! Really great app, I even got my parents in on the perks and bought them both a premium account. Would recommend 10 times out of 10!"
I love this app it is great I even have the lyrics too I am so happy üòÅ also it is really quick to install even with low storage space.
Quick loading. Good free trial. Helps artists.
Spotify app is so beautifully designed offering a lot of choices and it literally knows what you like. üëåüëå‚úå‚úåüíØ
If you are searching for an music app Must try it . I love this application. Its design and search pool is amazing You will love it's working style .go and must try onceüëçüòÄ
"Lyrics. We finally have in-app lyrics. And they brought back the quick search within liked songs. For a premium user, this is definitely an excellent experience."
I give this a 5 star because the app is designed well for Teens and adults. I really don't mine the ads on this app. My favorite part about this app is it has a setting for Explicit content. It shows E so I know if itis going to say bad stuff. I really injoy that because I don't like bad stuff. Also thay have clean versions of songs that I love. Thanks
This apps just so good I've been listening to Spotify for a long time everything's good but there's just one problem with ads its just so disturbing while your enjoying your song there comes the ad to ruin your enjoyment üòëüòí
"I really love this app so far, it's very cool and easy to navigate, the UI & UX are extremely awesome so perfect"
"Fantastic. Works well with an Alexa, which was not very compatible with apple. Users can interact and share content quite easily."
Fantastic App! Subscribe! Very intuitive and excellent content! Listen to Joe Rogan all day long! Malone interview is very informative. We should be ashamed of our medical industries tyrannical ambitions!
"Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world. Basic functions such as playing music are totally free, but you can also choose to upgrade to Spotify Premium. ... Build collections of music and podcasts. And more! Spotify is an excellent streaming music service that wins PCMag Editors' Choice award."
"I can always find the songs, albums, and content I'm wanting. The app is quick to start up. And I haven't had but just a few glitches or freeze ups. Finally a music app that works...."
"EDIT: I have songs downloaded and it keeps telling me I need internet connection. I redownload the songs and the same thing happens. I have the membership to download the songs, so why am I paying it when I still need connection to listen to the songs. Enjoying all my favorite music. Quick to put new music. Love it"
Super op its is best for muice app and its really op i listen 2000 songs üòéüòéüòéüòé
An amazing app a close friend of all musicans..ui can say proudly..my self as a MUSIC DIRECTOR and FLUTIST...of ANYTICKETS MUSICAL EVNTS LONDON.
"It worked fine before but they updated it and its ruined always freezing, unliking songs etc. I bought premium and it was worth it but not anymore. Please fix your app!"
I have been using paid version of spotify for quite a few years now and still love it!
"Great app,, nice ui,, smooth experience,, great music quality,, less ads,, üëåüëç,, awesome app üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"This is the best music streaming platform around. I canceled my subscription as audio had weird, not-so-punchy bass, but I have now revisited the app and found that audio normalization is to blame. Now the bass is the same as other platforms. The app is stable and the overall experience is great. The music selection is quite rich and literally every device/OS supports Spotify, including WearOS. Overall, satisfied and will most likely subscribe."
Yall have translated lyrics integrated with the song's normal lyrics now. Helps in singing with feelings. Saw it on Dos oruguitas. Yall are winning and I'M here for it! Really excited to see what more you guys will bring to the table! Keep going!
"I cant log into my spotify, keeps telling me its set to offline, when i press connect it doesnt work and sends me a email link, when i press on the link it says it may have expired. Yet the link expires after 4 hours plz help i dont know what to do Edit: team was very quick and helpful and im back to listening to my music again:)"
I love Spotify. But the thing is that I can't see the playback and pause/play button bar so you can't look at the Musixmatch lyrics anymore. I can't rewind or fast forward. I found this out just this morning. What's up with that?
"Intuitive interface easy to use and understand. Some clever features, set up for more social interaction than other sites."
"Amazing music, love this app . This app is like a guide , When I'm sad and happy i hear music through this app i love this app so much"
"Got a minor bug: In the ""liked songs menu"" you can filter the songs based on the genre. I use the aforementioned menu to get new music to add to a designated playlist later. The issue is if you filter it to a genre, then un-like the all the songs in that filter you can't select a different filter even if you take spotify out of your running apps and run it again. The only way to fix it is to add a song of the ""filter genre"""
"I love how easy and simple it is to work this app and two ads every few minutes is pretty reasonable. I kinda find it frustrating that you can only choose a few songs until you have to buy premium or wait for a while. It also gets a little bit annoying that you can only select one song at a time to put on a playlist on a phone, but I guess you could easily hop on a computer to do all that. Thanks for the app even though it doesn't meet all the requirements I want, but I'm still pretty happy!üòÉüéµ"
"Despite the junk out there, there's still just nothing as good as a quality app, UI and massive collection of music than this one. I went back to another brand for a few months and found myself wishing they had the swapping mechanism and variety Spotify has and have just come back."
"Great app, I get to find and listen to all my childhood songs and new songs. And God bless these folks for standing up to the ""woke"" liberal media and agenda seeking to stifle our personal freedoms, by continuing to support and provide great programing like Joe Rogan."
"Best UI and User experience, also best algorithm. Please keep working UI, and please work on Windows app as well."
"Not perfect, but what ever is? Overall it's an excellent app that I plan on continuing to use and would recommend to others."
Ads aren't too bad. Would never spend money on music streaming but Spotify creates Playlist suited for you.
"I have spotify premium and I can completely recommend it. The algorithm is very good I discovered so many artists and songs thanks to him. The design is simple and pretty, the app has a lot of features and is very intuitive to use. I never had any technical problems either."
"It's spotify what can you say? Good app, good user experience"
"My one problem i have been having for quite some time is if i open spotify and click over to search or my playlists too quickly, the app freezes and starts to load forever. Thus making me close the app, open it and then waiting for the home screen stuff to load."
All Trending music and albums are available. Impressive UI.
"Go Spotify!! Don't let those Orwellian losers bully you into censoring the content you provide on your network! I really respect y'all for sticking to your guns and continuing to be a platform for all voices, not just those that certain people deem ""appropriate."" Also the app has greatly improved after going through a pretty big rough patch and I really appreciate the effort y'all put in for usability. My only quip is that Discover Weekly often has songs and artists I already listen to!! üòÜ"
music quality and user experience is superb but it will be best if there is option of downloading songs without paid and music is playing in somewhat low sound
All bugs fixed so I'm upping my review. Use it daily and love it! Sometimes the UI can be clunky though.
I love Spotify this has my fav songs expect one also the ads it ruins the moment but if u get premium there will be no ads but this is a fav app I will always listen to songs everydayüéµüé∂üéº
One of the best music üéµ in play Store. No one can beat Spotify. Some of the best features are 1. Less Ads 2. Very Smooth UI. 3. Best Recommendations 4. Almost all songs available in Spotify.
"Awesome app the most stable, well designed reliable music app"
Very easy and quick to use and straight forward
Simply the best music app picks on your flavour and dishes you extra precise suitable music according to your library
Good quality music quick and easy
"Spotify asking me to give them 5 star rating, personally I think they are equivalent to I-heart, Pandora, and the rest. They are all pretty good."
Great app very stable with a vast library of materials to suit most people's taste.
"This app continues to improve and premium is absolutely worth it. You can even play your own audio files. Problems get fixed, you can see your recents, UI is great, design is nice. Wrapped is always a highlight and you can mix yours with someone else. I love using it with maps too! Lyrics had been missing for years, im glad they're back! Problems rn: I might prefer if lyrics scrolled smoothly without the rapid change to the next line. I would also love to see which songs belong to which genres."
I pay premium i download my playlists and for some reason every few days the app undownlouds my songs and re-downloads them killing my battery and ruining my music experience at work where I don't have service and can't download them
There are some features in Spotify which I'm absolutely in love with : 1. Crossfade 2. Song gets automatically downloaded when added to a playlist 3. Able to control the playback from any device 4. Equalizer 5. Change quality of songs downloaded And the UI is just perfect.
"I've used spotify for years and I can't explain the experiance that this app has given me. The playlists it makes for me are great and I love every single song they have on there. I used to get told all the time that Apple music is better but with Spotify, you get what you couldn't from Apple music. With every add I hear, I find a new song that I like. Thank you Spotify for giving me the music I have and continuing this amazing app!!!!!"
Awesome UI/UX plus a lot of songs with lyrics ü§©
This is the one of best song app in the world‚ò∫. All have requiest to rate this appüëçüëçüëç
Great music selections. Easy to use and build great music Playlist. Have recommended it to all my friends. Check it out.
"I've known this app for quite a long time but was never interested in using it but the moment I attempted making use of the app, I never looked back. The developers of the app did a great job in creating such a master piece of an app. No wonder it's the 1 streaming app in the US.üôå"
Works quite well for my musical needs and has been my favorite musicial app for years now!
"I've been using Spotify for over 5 years for a reason! It quick it's reliable, my only complaint is with no warning some songs are removed and I can no longer listen to them....üòë"
I've had Spotify for quite a while now. I love it! It's my go to for my faves and searching for something different couldn't be any easier. $10 bucks a month and my umpteen playlists at my finger tips. Doesn't get any better than that. 100 stars!ü§©
"The best music application, i have premium with my family and its amazing, the new udpate with the lyrics is so good!! We have access to any music even unreleased and the app design is wonderful"
"Very nice.....I love the app, tha app is cool in design and shows new playlist everyday And of the singers which we listen the most üëçüòç"
"Hands down, this app is apart from the crowd, and in so many ways better that other apps I've used. Such as Pandora, you tube, and others. Great job Spotify, as a artist and in appreciation, Spotify has made a masterpiece, a work of art, that had me entertained and captivated for hours and days on end. Sincerely, and genuinely, thank you Spotify and those that created, run, and operate Spotify. You're the best!!!!"
"The songs are quite complete, unfortunately I have to Premium . If you want to be free"
"Never used the app /service before, but now I want thanks to Joe Rogan n Spotify backbone regarding this whole controversy thing. If they came cuz it was built, now let them leave if so they choose, real family and friends stay behind and let the new follow and support. (After all, all is being Censored, Monetized, and Perverted.)"
Even though a few or a lot of people choose 1 star I believe that Spotify will become better and great I will still download this app even though people call it horrible don't judge quickly as I hope that the next update will be better 10/10
This is a amazing music app! It has my favorite songs! But the thing is it doesn't have download button pls put some....great app I'll give this a 5 star
Nice music and lots of choice to suit every occasion
I still find the songs I want quick & easy.
"okay I like spotify but stop adding songs to my playlist. -update 3 years later, spotify is sooo much better w premuim and tbh its so worth it"
Ditched Pandora years ago and I regret nothing. The ability to customize and share a Playlist while getting the intuitive experience of having music (I ACTUALLY like) suggested makes it top tier. I've even gone on to purchase a family plan to spread that same feeling to my family. Thank you for supporting so many artist (some of them close friends of mine) on your platform.
"Please bring back the quick scroll bar on the side for liked songs, It really helps"
"Great ui loved it, you should buy premium its worth the price, amazing app overall 9/10"
"Great app and really enjoy the music and building special playlists to enjoy. But word of advice for Spotify owners, stay neutral from politics. These are ugly times. Folks just want to listen to music or podcasts. If they don't like what they hear they simply can turn the channel to something they do like. Do not cave to a small percentage of those who think their policies and opinion should be the opinion of the whole. Freedom is what endures forever. That, and keeping the price low too ;)"
Amazing UI ! Love the suggestions!!
"I love driving and Spotify. Singing while going on road trip is life altering. And Spotify has favorites, liked song list, and music scrapped together for driving, or gaming, or exercising at gym. Even meditative sounding audio play. I truly enjoy Spotify the best from other site designers others the the tubers and all source's - Spotify is champ of musical reach. Thank you Spotify teams and people. Happy New Year's"
I really love the app. Very easy to use UI. There's almost no limit to the customization of playlists and your qeue. Overall an amazing experience
I enjoy that Spotify doesn't run my battery low quickly & I can listen to Spotify while browsing the world wide web & I can turn screen off and Spotify continues to play while I exercise to my saved playlist.
"I've been using the premium subscription for years. I've never had issues with the apps, and generally find their updates to be intuitive. I live in South Korea and while some older songs are still romanized, most have the lyrics in Korean. It is frustrating that you can't change the language settings in the app, it follows the language your phone is in. But to me the music quality, quantity and download options make up for it. Overall a nice service that's worth the price."
Im specially after UI in every app. Spotify is so friendly and looks amazing. If there a option to hide and show the current playing music by swipe up and down would be very usefull. :)
"Once you find a song you like, you can click the three dots (related actions button) and start a ""Radio"" that will play similar songs. Best feature in my opinion. I give it 5 mics."
Using Spotify for years now and I have never enjoyed a music app quite like this!
"The app is good. I can play all the songs I want. And no adds, the songs continuing to play."
i have an undying love for spotify. nothing else quenches my thirst for music quite like this. i am Happy.
"Once updated, Spotify is the greatest music app I've ever used! I love the intuitive playlists crafted for you based off your listening to just a few vsongs - very unique!"
One of the best and helpful compliment... Dot see any bugs..! I am talking inside this app ads are very closed in after 1/2 songs but it's possible because ussage world wide and feels like a genuine....... !!!!!
"improve UI make it easy to follow artists, or to play radio based on a song or artist, etc."
"I quite like the student discount they provided :) Great functionality, and is user friendly."
"I changed from 1 star to 5 for supporting and standing by your content creators. I have also seen improvements in the functionality of the app. Please continue to allow free speech and freedom to express different viewpoints. If you work for Spotify and don't agree know that just because you don't like something doesn't mean you get to force censorship on everyone else. The minute you get what you want we all lose. STFU or quit, that's your right, nothing else."
"I love this app because I can make unlimited playlists, share them with friends, and explore new music! Spotify quickly learned my music taste and never fails to deliver!"
"Been using this for several years now and just love it. Easy, intuitive, makes great playlists easy, trending lists to suit your listening styles etc. Can't imagine life without this (and DIFM) ."
I have been using it since 2010 and haven't had a problem with it related to the app itself. Just realised how cool and intuitive App this is when I had to stop using it for a couple of month due to a problem with my credit card and had to use YouTube ... that's when I realised how much I missed Spotify *‚Ä¢*
Spotify is a user friendly app that preforms excellent. I am very happy to support their product and I will be continuing to use their app.
"Enjoyed the Spotify Premium service in particular. My most sincere complements and thanks to all of the very talented staff there at Spotify. You can tell much thought went into even the most minute detail. Spotify staff truly love what they do and in doing so, they show how much respect and genuine care they have for their customers."
Cool app. And with the latest update I can add some good 70s folk rock into my mix without having to worry about pressing the skip button every time Joni Mitchell starts caterwauling about clouds or SCIENCE!‚Ñ¢ or some such nonsense.
App is really well designed and intuitive. Music and podcasts sound fantastic. Brilliant experience all around.
"Very easy to use. Spotify makes Playlists suited to your music tastes, mood, occasions, activities, etc. Ads are infrequent and short. I highly recommend this app!"
"Love the App. The last update caused a glitch. After I play, say a podcast, and the close the app. When I re-open, the built in player does not come up. The podcast continues where I left off, but I have no way to pause etc, because the player isn't visible. I've uninstalled and re-installed to see if that would fix the ""glitch"", but no luck.To get it back, I need to restart my phone, or do a force stop on the app.Don't know if anyone else is having the same issue? FYI - MY Phone is a Galaxy S10+, fully updated."
A very reliable App. Helps me find the gospel songs quickly and contains songs i would not be able to find easily usibg other Apps. Thankyou Sporify.
Love this app so much. Have been using it a lot more since December as I got 6 months free Spotify Premium as a benefit when I got my Samsung phone in October. Will be continuing with premium (but paid of course) once the 6 months free of charge Premium ends. So happy that local files option is now on Android phones aswell as on desktop version. Keep up the amazing experience. Thank you Spotify üëå
"Great app and love the fact that Spotify actually will take time and use some technical thing they have, a simple thing that can see what type of music I like no matter how diverse my playlists and then recommend sons/ artists I may also like. Something other music apps haven't quite managed to master. I also like the fact that as long as the low subscription is up to date, I can still listen to my fave tunes without internet connection that's great as my commute in mainly underground"
"This is by far one of the best apps. The ui is sleek, suggestions work great , my family has no problem with paying the relatively small cost of the family premium membership (which covers our 4 accounts), great music selection, I've started listening to some podcasts. And it is just overall a solid app. The only problem I have with it would be how much space its takes up, but with how much I use it that's worth it"
"I'm giving Spotify 5 stars because it's one of my favorite apps. However, I'd suggest adding a feature to confirm if a user is sure when deselecting the ""download"" button on playlists. I accidentally did that the other day and had to download a whole 2 gb Playlist over again. Which sucks because data is expensive in my country."
"As a DJ and music connoisseur, this app allows me to store, play, and discover not only my favorite tracks but also my future favorite tracks. It is like having the ultimate record collection without the debt or storage space required physically or digitally. Spotify rocks!!!"
"Update: They brought back the ‚è™‚èØ‚è© AND driving mode. üíôüòÅ ‚Ä¢ 3/'21: Love Spotify. Had it for many years on PC. Would give 5 ‚òÜs if Spotify would include itself and the ‚è™‚èØ‚è© buttons on the drop down notification bar on Androids for quicker access to them like it used to. It was b/c of this feature that I deleted other apps. Having to minimize all apps to reopen Spotify app, and then reopen the track just to get the ‚è™‚èØ‚è© menu is a bummer... I need this feature back please."
"Moved over from amazon music after amazon just wouldn't play my extensive playlists over the alexa and also just on an aux in my car. Utterly frustrating when there long drives to be had to university and its my only alone time away from 2 kiddos, self care in important. Spotify has worked perfectly, the tracks it recommends are on point after only using it for a month it's got my taste down to a tea. Really user friendly, even my 5 and 9 year old can make their own playlists."
"I LOVE THIS APP, (I have Spotify premium) and it has made my experience 10 times better, just listening to my favourite songs in high res without any interruptions feels like heaven and not to mention this app definitely has 95% of songs on the planet so that's cool, I love Spotify wrapped aswell, makes me feel special Lol. the ui is top notch! Getting used to audio books on there aswell nowadays, it's way better than I thought, worth it if you aren't using the free plan"
I enjoy the way theymake up lists for me. They are quite accurate in what they choose. I am an elderly person and like 40s popular and classical music and they pick out music that i didn't know about. It is well worth having.
Thank you for being ethical and considerate of your users. I like the app coz the commercials are noninvasive like YouTube. Plus the interface is nicely designed and suggestions are very relevant. Highly recommended üëç Keep up the good job
I just love Spotify because of the best blues selection I can get and also I can practice my guitar through the backtrack options it allows me to enjoy practice and listening to.
Has a music lover. This app is good and huge collection of music but one thing is about adds .Spotify broadcast same adds repeatedly please change adds after one by one and make some long gape between two adds it's comes quickly soo please solve itü§óü§óü§ó
Always solid audio quality very few glitches to the app and when there are any glitches they seem to fixed them quickly! Also daily mixes are the best thing ever! And plenty of podcasts if that's more your avenue
"Spotify is the best music app i've tried, it's really easy to use and has a lot of recommended playlists that spotify makes, and music that you can explore, and the app is easy to use. even if a lot of people say there are a lot of ads and can't play the music they like because of the new update, just pay for spotify it's really cheap and you'll find spotify easier to use when you pay for it. i use spotify everyday from day to night, i thank everyone who built spotify and everyone who manages it"
"Honestly didn't like it at first but in my opinion,it's subscription is affordable to most and I love the offline dowlading options. I also like how it builds playlists based on my taste in music and Spotify wrapped is cool. I'm sure their are better options but Spotify is easy to use and has never shown itself to be a bad app."
"Spotify is awesome as a service. I literally signed up because of Joe Rogan. I've been thinking about it ever since Rogan and Spotify signed their deal, but their adherence to their contract despite controversy sealed the deal. The user interface for the app isn't exactly intuitive. It is challenging to get back and forth into the queue versus a play list versus an album that I'm looking at. I would maybe suggest multiple tabs that are easy to access."
"New to this. So easy to use. Loving building my library with a variety of media. Would like to see more female writers in the audio book menu. Family package is excellent. I'm not all that fussed about the digital world, but I'm really engaging with Spotify I am enjoying having easy access to my favourite artists and listening to new stuff based in Spotify's recommendations."
Just glad that the lyrics feature is back on the roll after a very long time. Moreover the little ui tweaks day by day is also great and enhances the experience than what it was before. Happy to be a premium member and keep up with the minimal great changes :)
"I wish the app had a ranking and review button, none of the apps has this feature. This will make easy to listening to podcast, some music such as hypnosis etc. Keep this feature free if implemented."
"The service in general is very good. The app itself is too bare. An option to create a personalised library of favourite albums that looks like the one in Poweramp would be great. The integration with Sonos and Chromecast is very bugged, lots of disconnections or hang ups that force me to force quit and restart the app. Recently I'm starting to dislike the black and green theme too. I would rather have the option to change it to a classic black text on a white background."
"It would be incredible if you guys could figure out a better layout for the 'now playing' song part for tablets. (You know, the one with the lyrics and play/pause buttons.) Something like putting the lyrics on one side of the screen and the play/pause buttons on the other side. Left and right. Guys, it would be nice if we had the ability to check the 'date of release' of songs."
"üôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩ. It is relatively less costly, gives you lyrics, consumes less data, and the app has classic graphics. It is actually the best music streaming app. Thank you Spotify."
"Absolutely some of the best content out there in one place. A little quirky in the operational side of things, but the content cones through with patience and its worth it."
This is absolutely amazing!! I have switched from YouTube/YT Music to this and have absolutely no reason to look back (or elsewhere) for music! It is easy and intuitive and I haven't found a song I wanted to hear who's is unavailable.
Not as many ads as their competition and the playlists are intuitive and filled with new discoveries (and a few walks down memory lane too!)
"If you had more stars I would give them to you. I like it. I was looking for a specific music genre Christian County, and wow lo and behold there it was. The only thing that would make it even better, a random mix button."
"Plenty of musical options and thousands of hours of amazing podcasts, but the best part is how quickly the algorithm learns what you like and gives you what you didn't even know you wanted. Check it out you will not be disappointed."
"First time user and I like it better than pandora, at work pandora just keep on buffering until it gets connected and then is ok, Spotify connects to my phone and portable devices very quick and I like the music selection and the daily playlists. I don't have a premium subscription yet but will see what happens in the near future."
"Still in 3 months trial, so far so good, im very happy with the quality and performance online and offline üí™üí™üí™. Greetings from Malaysia. Tried Youtube Music but i prefer Sportify due to the easy user experience. Highly recommended"
"My son, 30 years younger, showed me Spotify. Apple and Amazon drove me away from their players. I don't mind Spotify's subscription fee if musicians get paid and the app doesn't get to grabby. I listen to Spotify about 10 hours / week with ear buds, a JBL Flip 4 or my car's radio bluetooth connection. I'm frequently out of cell range and like being able to save music to my phone for (in car) listening. The app is useable and sounds good. I'm rebuilding my music collection here."
Spotify is my go to music app and I love the new update! Now I don't accidentally hit shuffle on my playlists since they moved the shuffle button to the side. No complaints on this appüòÅ
"The new update got worsen than before, before was the album bug, then this one, when I transfer to SD card, all downloaded playlists didn't play at all. Kindly fix the app, subcription is quite yet the app didn't meet that standard."
"It's doing everything I want it to, intuitively and with ease.I did the 3 month free trial and when it's over, I can't imagine getting rid of it. I'm super frugal, but this is the bees knees."
"I was quite amazed about the range of music available in Spotify,even old songs than are not found in other apps now , this is the great app I ever download."
"I love the variety of music i can listen to and how i can go to different apps without my music shutting down, quite convenient when i want to multitask"
"Thanks...a very good soul company , glad it does not require another login and password for every access as most other apps do , during the course of last two months due to my international travel arrangement I have had to install at least 35 apps and each was asking you to be unique and with combinations of UpperLowerNumSpecialASCIIset....$+$:21615,#'7':,#dsyeiwndyfwy..."
"I love music, and I've been playing guitar for 33 years now. Spotify just works for me. I find all the great guitarist that inspired me, and get to listen anytime üòä. It's worth $9.99 a month to me!!!!"
"There are issues but honestly the UI, selection, radio, and service is so vastly beyond any other offering that it's easy to overlook."
Every bit of music at the touch of a button. Especially with my different play lists and choices. Great for the entire family!!!
Been using since 2019(premium). Totally worth it. The vast music database and the UI support even to devices with weak compatibility just does it for me.
"Have had Spotify for a good few months now, it's alot less problematic and far less prone to breakdowns to the main competition, (the biggest river in Brazil!,) Infact there's no comparing the two. Spotify is a country mile ahead in every respect. Spotify is the yardstick by which others must be measured, all of whom have a good way to go. Spotify is a great app with clever intuitive features to explore ones own music genre's, very well thought out, and very nicely designed."
"Spotify is fluid, lucid and so easy to use and understand. I like getting my music, podcasts and more in such a well thought out platform. Thanks Spotify!"
"I like this application, it suits me very well especially the playlist recommendations which is somehow arranged correctly for me. All the songs are free to listen to, however this app has 2 problems for me First. (probably) I have to pay a premium to download the song. Second. This app takes up a lot of space on my device. Well that's it from my review, thank you üôÇ"
"Surpassed my expectations in many ways than one. Well designed, access to millions of songs just at a click of a button indeed, life has never been so joyous with your rhythms."
"Easily the greatest and most important app on my phone, without a doubt. I don't think an optional new UI would go unnoticed I think it would be a good edition. I also think a feature to highlight obscure and less popular music should be implemented, otherwise perfect app well done guys!"
"Spotify HAS Completely Changed the way I Experience Music! FREE is MORE than FINE by ME. I used to listen to Pandora ONLY due to their ease. W/O affording the $9.99 a month, I Couldn't happily continue Pandora with the ADS during times of concentration. Meditation. Quiet time then boom some blaring AD. Since allotting myself time to understand the simplicity in its usability I have taken my music experience to the NEXT LEVEL. THANKS SPOTIFY @justcarmia"
Definitely the best streaming service for music. Lots of quality of life features like Spotify Connect and Wrapped. The new addition of lyrics for every song is also very helpful. The app itself is very clean and well designed with no bugs even on the Galaxy Z Fold 3. Take my money!
Spotify provides listeners with an assortment of music experience that's tailored to their needs! The GUI is super cool and you even have lyrics to sing along. Thanks for bein awesome Spotty :)
"I like this music streaming app the most because you get to listen to other user's public playlists. Regular people are usually better at picking music than persons acting as corporations are, so I like that Spotify is okay letting me hear what other people like too. I also like Spotify's song queuing method. Good job, Spotifolks!"
A great app which just keeps getting better. Nice touch with the 2021 review aswell. Would be nice to have 1) Always accessable fast access to equaliser. 2) multiple equaliser presets. 3) Instantly save all types of radios & rename as playlist 4) quicker way of linking to artists/ albums. 5) Resume where left off as an option. 6) New daily recommended from similar genre listeners. 7) find out how donations will benefit the artists work. 8) Any info artist wants to add about the recordings. =:--)
Thank you for designing this app.My day doesn't end without this app. I like how the app suggets next songs based on Junro of the songs we listen. Amazing new features at the end of year!!
"Spotify has quality service and even when you're offline, you get the pleasantries of music. The various things Spotify has to offer are what attracted me so quickly. I didn't get premium until a year ago and I would never go back. There is a bigger difference than you think and the 7-day trial is worth it."
"I have used many Music and podcast apps for past few years, Spotify is the only app that has a clean UI and a plethora of podcasts. Price might be on higher side compared to other apps in India , but its worth it."
"This much power to listen to virtually any song ever recorded -even in the car- is almost too much lol! I even used it to calm my son who was in a lot of pain as I took him for an emergency procedure. Music is the soundtrack of life, and Spotify make it easy to customize to any situation on the fly, or quickly download an entire Playlist or album in seconds!"
"For me, Spotify is the best app for listening music, Probably because I have premuim, but you can listen to any song, and make playlists, I have alot of liked songs and its easy to find a song you like, I reallly like Spotify and it is highly reccomended"
"At first I wasn't too sure about the app, but it quickly starts to know what you like and give you great suggestions. I found music that I forgot about and found great new music. Really enjoying it! Would definitely recommend. Just wish we can get 360 reality music on this app soon."
"we need previous & next buttons on the mini playback bar on the bottom of the app. & a section for random songs of different genres we might like, to start streaming. & make your recommendation algorithm more scary accurate."
"I could never understand why they didnt add lyrics in app, and now they have its 5 stars from me, 15 quid for a family pass giving you 5 accounts to endless music. As a physical media fan, i have to admit, its pretty amazing. Adding HQ and Atmos music would make it unbeatable."
"It's awesome and complete. Podcast, lyrics, offline playback(wish you could keep those even when your subscription ends.) The precise daily mix that actually suits your music taste. All the genres of music, the latest releases from your favorite artists... It's all here. Plus the subscription isn't too pricey. It's actually decent.üëåüèº Kudos team. Don't slack! Keep it up.üíØüî•üí™üèº"
The app is now working quite properly. Most bugs from the last update have been fixed. But I haven't done the last update yet (and I probably won't). It seems to be keeping up quite nicely especially with the cache management during the no-internet times. I personally still don't like the new widget but that's a different story. I thought it was temporary to be honest. In the overall the app went back to its glory And did a very well job with the musicmatch implementation.
"Awesome UI! However, I don't know why songs lyrics isn't still available across board. Edit: Lyrics feature was launched globally, and guess what? I switched! All round app for me üíØ"
"I L O V E I T ! Especialy the new lyrics option! I was happy like a little kid when I saw that little button :-) Now, there is one more thing to upgrade, and it IMPORTANT - you need to add some animated screensaver for TV users, cause new generation TVs shouldn't have still picture for long time. If I leave Spotify for a couple of hours, there are shadows on the screen on the place where the album image is on Spotify. That is a small thing for devs and huge for users :-) Thanks for great app!"
"Choppy when u have other apps open with it running in background and if it isn't choppy it's skipping like ur listen to a cd... Which defeats the purpose of the app for me.... Yesh at least this 3 months is free cause I will NOT be continuing subscription if I can't play one song completely threwwww üò§üò§ & it is buffering while my apple music app has already searched//found//dowloaded song AND is already playing it on loseless Audio, and all I see is the buffering light bouncing still on ur app"
"As an update, everything's all good now! UI and UX are even smoother than before! Thank you Spotify for fixing those! I am planning to get Spotify Premium now on üòä üôè"
"The current collection of songs is underwhelming and pales in comparison to other competitors like Saavn and Wynk. A lot of songs are simply not available, for instance Twenty One Pilots, Mayday Parade's new album etc. That being said, the overall integration across all your devices including Linux makes Spotify a clear winner. 4/5 Update: Massively improved quality of life improvements alongwith an increased song library and the competitive pricing. 5/5"
"Use it daily, and in general I love it. One quirk I noticed - sometimes if I skip ads, podcast resets back to the start. Doesn't happen often though."
"I love spotify. Been paying for premium the past 6 years(and the free hulu subscription) Its worth the 10 bucks a month for endless playlist, shuffle button, daily mixes, etc. I have a Playlist that is 123 hours long... and about 15 others that make up every genre a person needs."
"Great experience with spotify for over a yaer now, and the main thing is its mighty algorithms that always know what you want and when you want. I find ""discover weekly"" very accurate, it almost always gives me what i want, and so i always have something new to listen. The price for premium accaunt in my region is very reasonable and i appreciate that. App has also a solid design."
"Pretty good. There are some nuisances, and the suggested music can be lacking in variety, but it is free so no complaints."
The best music app ever.. The UI is cool and the mind blowing feature of creating a playlist inspired from the kind and pattern of music you listen to is just mind blowing. Just hope it is not some serious bug tracking s**t
"I love the design and features of Spotify, the way it allows you to view your friend's activity and how they categories profile, artist, album, and etc. It just saved alot of our time. ALWAYS SPOTIFY"
"In a phrase, there is nothing I cannot do with the music I love using this application. I love the music ranging from the 30s through the 70s, and amazingly, I have found every song that I wanted from that era. I find that quite remarkable considering that some of this music is almost 100 years old when it was originally priduced."
"Awesome app with clean UI. Loved the audio quality and service!!! Although i am unable to find songs of some artists like Linkin Park... But still i have waited for Spotify, and my wait is over and I am now able to use this mind blowing, awesome and clean music streaming service üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÄüòÄüòÄ"
The best music app in terms of UI/UX. The selection of music is also great. I just hope that Hi-Fi music will be available in the future.
Extremely easy to use and opened up a vast world of music and podcast. Especially like exceptionally easy connectivity between phone and TV and car and ability to build a library to listen to off line
I love Spotify but sometimes it likes not load right or it just quits don't know why but it does other wise great. I have now listened to manly Spotify and in my opinion it's still best out there with choices and what they have to offer .
"The absolute best app to stream music. The UI to the audio quality to the user experience to the suggestions, every thing is on point. If spotify releases hi-fi audio, it'll become unbeatable. But even now its the best."
Just does what you need to listen to great music. The recommendations helps explore new ones or never heard before. UI is unmatched in its intuitiveness.
"Love the app but it need to add a ""undo button"" I am tired of accidentally unliking a song and then it's in a different place from when it was at first, it also makes it look like I am just now liking the song or just hearing about it"
"Good to listen to music of your choice that suits your personality, all of the time. Have been using Premium Edition since inception, can't rate highly enough."
"Pleeeaaaaassseeeeeeeee!!! Add a ""retry payment"" button. Just as Netflix did. So we can retry payment when we've got the money. It's tedious to have to re-enter my payment info."
I've had Spotify for a few years now and I rely on it for my music - so easy to find what I want to suit my mood and the playlists they put together for me are great. Its well worth building up your own library. I am 75 and appreciate being able to listen to music that spans the years. Also a huge selection of apps so no reason to be bored! I would be lost without Spotify.
"I used to search up and find music using YouTube and the like. This is by far the best app for music of any kind. With a great algorithm and brilliant UI, I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for:)"
Loved it I have been using spotify for three years and it was quite good except the ads but at the wnd of 2nd year i purchased the premium pack and I instantly experienced the change and the privileges. I renewed my pack after a year and the pack price has increased slightly and thats an issue i will be happy if they got down to their old price.
"This is a compatible Music listening to your everyday life, when it comes loved üé∂ you can find on online on YouTube also, the supply of the chosen product music you wanted. You can also download the apps. You should use this to search your favorite music üé∂ and then select the best option to play your guitar üé∏, when you wanted. A bit of sound quality leads to the how are you doing fine, how to cherish also. How do you know what is going well. Play Spotify music üé∂ is having also a good sound."
"All your music in one place, you don't need anything else. This app is great only downside is mobile search is not as fully functioning as the desktop, ui can be a little frustrating when switching between tablet and laptop."
"Super easy to use, extremely intuitive to your individual music taste, and constantly being updated with new features and fixes. üíï LOVE IT"
I use to be a big Pandora fan til a couple years ago. Started using Spotify and haven't touched Pandora again. The app is well designed and fast. Has to s of podcasts too.
this app is genuinely life changing. I get to listen to of my favorite songs for free !! and listen a bunch of new songs and it's so easy to work !! I'd recommend getting it. I already have 329 liked songs in just about a year.
"There are some adds but I really don't mind. Also the app layout is quite nice. The fact that you can hold the device horizontally, means that I can use this app on my tablet as well. So overall I give this app a 5 star rating."
"As a long term patron of spotify, i can say without reservation that my user experience with Spotify has been among my most pleasurable experiences with a single app of any purpose. It delives tunes with a powerhouse catalog of music bridging gaps in history, ethnocuture, genre, and more. Creating and personalizing of endless playlists makes sure your moody status update accompanys its own soundtrack. Ive had almost no complaints and live CS reps have restored my faith in singing out loud. üôä"
Best music app of all time. Find anything and everything with a easy to use UI that make the experience a blast. Love this app
"Great for finding music like the music that I listen to, the download feature has endless uses when I work because it's either a remote location or inside a thick building the data struggles to get to. You find more music that is like the music you like, because that has personal helped more than anything could when it come to finding new music, and the ""enhance"" feature has helped grow my playlists by a ton. Feels like premium is honestly worth it especially duo since I live with my girlfriend."
I love how easy you can use the app and sometimes it loads a few more songs so if your offline for a second or two it will continue to play I love how the app is built and I hope who ever works on this app daily like a mod or ceo's hope they have a good day. Edit: so I made my first review a year ago I think nd now I understand that sometimes when I get the 30 minutes of free listening if you watch one add some times I listen to two songs and I've got an add and I timed it one time aswell.
Genuinely Spotify not only gives a variety of Music across genres but also I like the Interface and the size in which song's name is written making it Pleasure to hear and a Wonderful Experience in all. The Song Name and ads are like not into your face Plus I really like how they encourage less renowned Singers by putting up their Wonderful songs in different Playlists.
"A more than generous and ever expanding catalogue of songs, albums, compilations featuring ""the best of, very best of,...) As known in the original release format.also playlists are compiled and listed DAILY to suit each listener, containing part ""established likes""and random""songs you might like, for every listener,also anyone can get creative compiling playlists,for their own convenience or to share with whoever likes the ""sound,of their Sounds.cost is several adverts per 30 minutes.Excellent"
The ability to find any song at the press of a button and within seconds. Being able to listen to my greatest artists performing even songs I never knew they performed is mind blowing. Definitely the best app ever. And it's childfriendly too. Spotify is definitely the best. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Looking for a music app that will complement your music listening audiophile equipment? Spotify is the place to be. Great music app. I heard they are working on Hi-Res, Hi-Fi settings, how exciting!"
"After 4 years of being a subscriber, what else can I say: the best music streaming service out there. Only note: I wish the UI would be a bit more intuitive, but the app pretty much alway had this problem and it did greatly improve."
I don't know if I'm the only one weird like this but I'd love it if there was a sort button in the playlists themselves so you can sort the songs alphabetically or by artists
Amazing amount of music available for download! My music library is quite eclectic. Just hit that shuffle button and I'm listening to all my favorites from every genre of music!
Best experience with any music app so far. Love the daily mix it builds for you. Spotify spoils the music explorer. Family plan is very worth it.
it is a great app but can developer make a new features for liked song. I always accidentally tap the heart button on my other playlist and it ruins my liked song playlist. Cna u make a warning text after the user tap on the heart button? it will make my life much peaceful thanks
"great music experience, the widget for the home screen could use bigger buttons for easier song selection, as well as play access from the pull down menu. LOVE SPOTIFY"
Love this app! I really enjoy the created Playlist based on what I regularly listen to. Believe me... I listen to quite a few different genres of music!üé∂
"Spotify Premium gives me endless pleasure, allowing me free choice of music and ability to build my library, organise it and then readily choose from my favourites. Customer service is excellent. Very happy."
"The UI, song recommendations, and podcast experience is fantastic. My only gripe is that ""Hey Spotify"" is inconsistent and at times inaccurate."
"It's one of the best music-streaming applications out there. Clean interface, pleasing to the eye, high quality audio and loads of features. And if you ever have a problem, their twitter @SpotifyCares is really quick to reply to your problems. Overall really smooth and flawless experience."
"Extremely satisfied! Although the fact that I listen to ads on podcasts as a Spotify premium member can get quite annoying. Other than that, 10/10 recommend üòÅ"
I love house/techno/classic dance. I had Apple music. Spotify has way more variety than Apple. I prefer Spotify UI also. Spotify doesn't have all the music that is present on YouTube.
I don't know what I would have done without spotify. My day starts with spotify and ends with spotify. I created my own playlist so I could listen to my own preferred kind of music. Spotify is a blessing in disguise as it entertains me with over a million songs and will always be in my life for as long as I live..........
"The greatest music streaming app; I've used apple music, Pandora, etc but this one has the best user friendly UI, great audio quality, multi-streaming options. Take my money please"
"I prefer to listen to spotify instead of the radio. I'm able to choose music that I prefer to listen to, only the ads are a bit of a nuisance, when I can't afford premium at the moment."
"Large searchable catalog. You can create sharable playlist and simply add songs to your custom stations that you can also share. Very reliable and affordable and I have been finding more edited song versions. Great UI, Platform, App."
"Spotify is an exceptional app. I truly admire the UX and UI, as it's very simple and straightforward. I personally find Spotify to be the best music streaming app ever!"
"Are there other ways to get your groove on, I am loyal to a fault, Spotify has not passed me off yet. I say 5 stars out of 5 stars. Try it, you'll like it, trust me, the only thing I take seriously, is fun. Give me life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. When I am pursuing happiness, I don't like to be impeded. When I want my music, I don't want to be hassled, w/ Spotify. I press play and my chilaxation begins."
It's a well laid out UI and the ability to stream to Alexa speakers/groups is a welcomed feature. Recently I had an issue with Android Auto where Spotify wouldn't work at all. Over a period of time Spotify support were helpful throughout and went through the diagnosis with me and we're both patient and pleasant. (Issue got resolved when my OS version updated). The playlist features - like sharing sessions - are really good and I can discover music really easily. I love the artist info too!
"love it when free, but premium you get what you pay for. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 2021 edit: please reconsider changing the like button. Perhaps relocate the like button next to the name/title of the song for easier functionality for example. I have unliked so many songs just because I've tried pausing lol. But in my defense, the Like button is right next the the pause/play buttonas well. Help?üòÖ"
OMG I love Spotify. My son downloaded it for me and if it ain't the greatest thing for music I don't know what is! I was using mp3 juices to download my favourites. And used up soooo much of my storage doing so. But NOW IM SO HAPPY! It got to the point I didn't even bother with music TIL HE GAVE ME THIS BEAUTIFUL GIFT! YEEEE BOI! could not Be happier! and I haven't had a single issue out of it.
"I LOVE this app. A couple things: please make a way for anyone to add music for themselves on spotify. im a kid and need to upload clean songs as i cant trust other ppl cuz they just say clan and dont actully make it clean. Also, it would be cool to play music in the car without needing premuim"
"I am satisfied & the price for the software is very accommodating! I appreciate that Spotify searches & offers songs of my persoanl preferance. The music, may then be selected, when required or desiring to listen at leisure. Thanks, Spotify! Joanne"
"Always had a good time with the spotify app. I have one request if possible, could you add a quick and easy way to swap to car mode? I don't have Bluetooth in my car so it doesn't automatically swap when I plug the aux in. Could there be a button to swap to car mode in the quick access menu in the top right when you're listening to a song? Thanks!"
"My only complaint is that they will loop your liked songs over and over even if you make a new playlist off of a song. Would like maybe a ""reset liked songs"" button or something to expand my horizons."
"Really good music app ! üíØ I'm just wondering why the hell the ""Hide this song"" button sometime pushes the ""Add to playlist"" down. It's confusing that buttons don't stay at the same place. Fortunately we can undo an unwanted hiding. Without this option my ""Like"" playlist would be empty by now ! ü§£"
"This is really cool. You can either have a paid subscription or just use it for free. The prices of Premium subscription is quite affordable. Even if you don't have a premium subscription, there aren't much ads. So if you're looking for an app to listen to music without spending money, go with this!"
"Use frequently, very smooth, brilliant UI, brilliant personalisation/customisation. Sometimes a couple of minor blips. Shuffle will sometimes randomly put the same song queued three times in a row (out of a playlist with 2000+ songs) either I should get a lottery ticket or there's a functional bug there, not a big deal though. Sometimes pressing the three dots ""menu option"" next to a song is unresponsive."
"Love it man, podcasts is what I mainly listen to with Spotify and they have a pretty good selection. Lots of options you can toggle if you're into fiddling and UI is pretty good"
Best music application available. Suggested playlist and songs are very accurate. Latest music and genres available. Easy to use. Great user experience overall.
"I really love this app! I was searching for apps where i can stream/download music and when I found Spotify, it quickly became my number 1 app for music and podcasts, but mostly music."
The app works well most of the time. There are some bugs that make the app freeze occasionally and or crash. Overall Spotify has a great library of music and a slick UI that makes it enjoyable to use. Spotify Premium is well worth it's cost for the no ads experience.
"Love that I get to listen to music when &what I want too,the only thing that I'd fix wld be when serching for a song when it pops up&you push play to listen to it another song will play instead??also cld do w/o the advertising ruining my music enjoyment!otherwise Spotify is üëç!"
"Ive been using spotify for the better part of 5 years, and i recommend it any time anyone asks. The spotify experience on mobile and on desktop has been seamless. Getting premium was well worth it and nearly paid for itself quickly in convenience alone. 5 stars"
"Quick, entertaining, easy to use, access to nearly every artist ever born, From early beginning's Beethoven, Bach, or jump into the latest rock. You can journey in some of the worlds most Beautiful country and throughout. With a chance to get fresh talk and hear all of what this world's rappin about."
"I love Spotify, I love the playlists it makes for me and the way it reccomends songs. I do miss the old UI style, the new layout is a little annoying in the fact that I can't listen to all the songs I've ""liked"" from a single artist without making a playing as you no longer have a ""library"" you just go to the artists page, but it's still a great streaming service."
"Dear developer, Your machine learning algorithms are excellent and always on point when it comes to suggesting something,the only issue with the application is that it requires a strong connection to the server and therefore the song stops at times while playing &also there are quite a few times when a lot of advertisement irritate the listener also there is no option to skip advertisements , please look forward to making a button for it otherwise the application cannot get any better. Thank you"
Overall loving the experience. My dad got here before I did and I'm embarrassed that I wasn't quick enough to change (I was attached to my ipod and iTunes). There are a few artist that they don't have so I'm hoping that they can add more non-main stream artists.
"Probably the best music app I used till date. I like the UI very much, playlist creation, songs suggestion to our moods and also the quality of the songs. It has millions songs even from young unknown artists and those songs are also good and the recent addition like Disney stories and other stories also good. Podcast is great and fun to listen while working out doing something. So much to explore."
I love it. It has so many playlists just suiting my moods and likes. It's really a great app for music when you want to chill drive or even cry your heart out. Even allows you to sing along with the lyrics ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ive enjoyed finding music that have travelled with me in life. The pld and still more new in the near future. I grew up listening to al genras and explore some never heard of. Yet ive not put into use all the experience Spotify has to offer. Im going through hard times but the music gives me tranquility. You are hete for me thank you. Thank you a lot. Keep up the good work dont let me down. Sincerely Susan Horton
Its fluid...it works...lots of whatever for whoever. Lots of album art and stuff ...Offline mode works well...just remember to update it ...worth the premium subscription highkey... 12 out 10 I guess...I've used Spotify a lot over...uh...3 or so years maybe more or less...its aight enuff to write a review about and not talk spicy in a negative way... I wonder if they'll give me a free month for this?
Before buying premium i didn't used Spotify that mush and used like 3 different apps to listen to music but after I've bought the premium i only use Spotify and i can happily say that I'm not disappointed and it meets all my requirements and is highly compatible and feature rich!
"What can I say, an app that deals in music streaming is a win no matter what. Now one as spot on as spotify is (pun intended) the GOAT! Thank you for being there with the perfect song all the time and the free range to build playlists with such ease."
"Spotify is the best application out there for music lovers. I would, however, ask that Spotify quickly expand its Group Sessions feature to free accounts as well. Other than that, the user interface is very pleasing and easy to navigate, and the quality and quantity of the music available is truly incredible."
Spotify makes listening to music a stellar experience for me. Hands down it's the best! A commercial or two every hour actually suits my pace because hey ya gotta pee sometime right? Spotify rocks!
I really love Spotify. Because it has tons of playlists which is very beautiful for different moods. I feel very happy to listen to songs and UI is very friendly. It would be much better if they had a lyrics options for music. But very beautiful app for music lovers. Keep going Spotify. And it would be really great if Spotify had hifi or lossless master audio quality option like apple music or tidal. So I request Spotify to get that option as soon as possible. Thank u
I love this app not only because of the large music library they have but also its app availability across different media devices and unobtrusive to other apps that require immediate attention. ‚≠ê‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
"It has been a very intuitive journey, through my mental health. Music gave me the ability to look at the video, but come up with my own version. Good or bad, it was mine. That's powerful to say with the life I've lived, in these 45 years. üòòü•∞ü§óüòãüòóüòÅüòöü§£üòéüê∂üòÄü¶Ñü¶Ñü§©ü§óüòè"
"Spotify is just great, it's always getting better and changing the UI and interesting ways. I like how at the end of the year they show me really cool stats about how I listen to music. The only thing I wish Spotify had was the actual lyrics to certain songs like how Apple music does"
Recommendation are top notch.. this ui feels smooth and easy to access. Huge collections of songs library and daily some special songs it offers. It's really worth my subscription.
Spotify is a music lover's dream in terms of its ease-of-use and intuitive interface. The incredibly full and deep database of song titles is also fantastic. Try it! You'll be glad you did.
"No competition for Spotify out there. Absolutely clear winner amongst musics streaming apps. Their UI, sound quality, recommendations, playlists, collection is top class. No space for cringe music untill you really search for it. Promotes quality music. Literally each and every single artists' profile is fantastically maintained.Don't need to say about podcasts. Do we ever look any where else for podcasts?"
My favourite and only muisc app i have used for years. Reliable. I love I can look at not just songs but whole albums and see the covers. Sometimes people don't remember all that or it's not an artist you are familiar with - or heard any other music from them - but you can find and listen. It can be a one off song you are listening to and favourite it or add it to playlists. It has everything I need and i don't need any other music apps. Connects with shazam to.
Spotify genuinely good it always enjoy over mood by it play list and by know our test and really improve our music sense and make us love and attachement towards this app I really like this app who provide a million of songs for us not other app compare Spotify due to it quality and I love and very enjoy all songs on Spotify tnx....and suggest please try once if you never try
"Just the best, premium is quite expensive after a while but it is 100% worth it. I couldn't imagine switching to any other music provider, Spotify is just perfect for everything; gaming, running, working out, chilling, there are the best quality songs to be streamed on your command."
"Spotify has the best intuitive interface, a fantastic recommendation engine powering its customized playlists, new features added all the time, social tools that make sharing easy, plus you can use it almost anywhere through almost any device. I really like what you have done with the design recently giving it more of a Fluid Look so Keep it Up ‚úåüèª."
"Please add a ""Pause downloads"" button and the ""Download with cellular"" setting should also apply on metered Wi-Fi connections. Been using this service for more than 4 years and it's good."
"17/09: Giving another star as they've harmonised their UI over Android & iOS - finally you can slide down to search any playlist! whoop whoop! Spotify just launched their newest feature: Blend. Allowing you to have a tailored, paired playlist with a friend. I am a bit of a Spotify fan boy (Their Discover Weekly won me over initially, great recommendations!) but when there is a tech issue it can leave the app unusable - so keep hold of your Soundcloud and YouTube playlists just in case."
"Edit: while there are still some songs available, situation has improved quite a lot, so updated the stars. App and service deserves 5 stars, but lack of songs in India is why I slashed the three stars. When it comes to streaming, huge catalogs are mandatory and essential. Hope the deal with Warner works out in India, but until then other platforms have more songs."
It has practically every song or artist I can think of. It's the only music or podcast resource I use. It's intuitive and easy to navigate.
One of the best music/song app platform. The songs are so clear and pure i just love this app. The quality of the songs is premium on Spotify even the UI is easy to use everything is great about this app‚ô•Ô∏èThe only disadvantage is you get 3-4 or 5 ads contionously which tells you to take their subscription. But it's totally understandable as we're using a free version even Spotify should earn something. Anyway. Good job developers:)
"This is GREAAATTTTT. Other than just listening to music it has a whole load of other cool features. Such as, the music just gets softer when another app is playing audio, unlike others who usually pause, It has a lot of shortcuts when you're listening via earphones, for example, a single click on the button pauses/plays the audio like normal but double tapping the button skips to the next song and triple tapping goes back to the previous one. Absolutely love it!!!"
"Spotify is just ""effin"" DOPE!! Super user-friendly, almost any and every single song...of every single genre, and the overall design and look of Spotify is extremely attractive! Job well done Spotify üíØüí™üèΩüî•üî•"
"In my personal opinion? The best streaming music app there is! So easy to build your own personalized lists, and the recommendations that Spotify makes helps you build the perfect library! Plus being able to find other user's lists makes the possibilities endless! A MUST HAVE App!"
"Giving it 5 because my year long problem has already been fixed. I hope this goes on. Im subscribing to premium again. (Please add a Play Next button! Also please allow us to add a whole album or playlist to be ""Play Next"" or add to queue)"
"Almost all music you can think of thats been commercialized is found here. Great app and great UI experience. Affordable too, try the share package if you have a family. Keep it up spotify!"
"Since the last update, if I double press the skip button on my headphones while listening to a podcast, it skips the whole podcast instead of just fast forwarding 15 seconds like it's supposed to and has always done."
"I do like this app alot and use it quite often, the premium isn't all too expensive, but I'd still prefer to not spend that much money, I don't like how you can't listen to one single song unless you're on an apple tablet. Nor am I fan favorite of not being able to download songs, but it does make sense nonetheless. Overall I would say it's a good app, and recommend it to anyone looking for a source to listen to music other than YouTube."
"It's so much more intuitive when searching I prefer to put songs in specific order on most Playlists However, not thrilled about not having older versions of songs and/or songs becoming n/a, but overall a great music app it's better than the other's that choose Playlists for you"
First time I've ever gone out of my way to give something a rating.... they added a way to listen to specific genres from your Playlist. My brain is about as organized as my liked.... so it reflects and taking the time to build a Playlist from 500+ songs is not something I have the attention span to do fantastic
"THE best music streaming service, easy to use, easy to understand. Building your own playlists, Download iconic albums and listen anytime anwhere. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
"I love this app as millions around the world do too!!! Super easy to use, updates you on the latest songs released by your favorite artists and recommends awesome custom-made playlists that suit your taste! 100% would recommend to everyone, miles better than every other music app and premium is definitely worth the money!"
"It may get a DJ option but you can make whatever playlist you like, within the vast choices of music. You can search by genre, mood, titles, artists and there are lots of built in playlists."
"Update: Good and decent app, a much better selection of music now, as compared to that of before. Suggestion: Please try to introduce FLAC and other HD formats. I used premium subscription for quite some time, but now I am exploring alternative platforms that might offer FLAC or even better sound quality. Of course I'm not complaining, but, just as a suggestion. I'm most likely to return to premium soon though."
One of the best streaming apps with an extremely wide selection of music. Only gripe is that the pricing for premium is quite high.
"I just love the fact that I can listen to any song on this app. I enjoy classic rock and this is the best place to find it. In a quiet moment or roadtrip, my Spotify playlist is my noisy, moody or brooding company"
"Listening to the Nine Design for many weeks, have learned so much, about myself, my family and friends.Started many years ago, but am still able to see new ways to change, especially being a 7!"
"After so many years last time I checked it, it's changed for the best. Having a lot of fun these past few days retaking my long loved collections, it's now a robust and intuitive platform. Thank you!"
"Well, the overall design of Spotify is impressive. Spotify is my new Music Vault. I do like Pandora, however I've noticed when playing my toddler music (age appropriate), adult rated music will sneak in - yes I said, ""sneak in"" as in sneaky - almost purposely introducing toddler innocent minds to *adult rated music* inappropriate and unappreciated. No Good* - please ""Spotify"" filter your playlist/channels delicately, bc mom's like me, I'm not having it! - ü§ó"
App interface is great. It provided me a best user experience than other music players but for better visual experience of title gif the lyrics tab can be hidden in gif focus view.
"It's kinda weird even having to rate Spotify after 23 million odd reviews. Been using it for almost a decade and gotta warn once you try it's going to be hard to quit. From a free user to premium, love their suggestions based on the user listening patterns not to mention their wide library of songs from all over the world. Offline listening, podcasts just seems get better year after year."
Good source for a variety of music. I love the different stations. I can name one of my artist and follow it with the word radio and I get quite a selection of music it's very similar.
"I've been using Spotify for quite some time now, and it's the only music platform I use. Theres not much to mention other than, it's my go-to, and it's so easy to use."
"I absolutely LOVE Spotify. I have ADHD and Bipolar so music is really important to me because it helps me concentrate and helps me manage invasive unhealthy thoughts on my tough days, I can barelyget by without it. I started using Spotify back in the begining of 2015 before it required a paid subscription for no adds and unlimited use and downloads, and I am 100% happy to pay for it, worth every single penny and really is so cheap considering what it has to offer. Also, the app is flawless üëå"
All songs are available here. I love SPOTIFY but one problem is there that when we press left rewinding button it don't change the song in the middle of any song. Rest of it is OK. Please fix it.
I love this app for music the only thing that sucks is some music from big artist isnt on there an then when u pay ur bill in the middle of the month it wants your payment again the beginning of the following month instead of waiting the 30 days its suppose to charge u i do love it tho thats why i gave it 5 stars theres just a couple tweeks they need to fix but ive been usuing it for years if y'all want a good music app this is it
The best one always. When I installed and started listening it's the best app compared to other ones. Initially without premium the ads were pretty frequent and quite disturbing. When I subscribed to the premium it was so great that everyday we would get our daily mixes and filtered podcasts daywise according to our followed lists. I would gladly recommend this app for music being a music lover‚ù§Ô∏è! go for it & enjoy the musicüéµ
"Much more enticing and Beautiful graphics are possible...as long as you're at it...maybe take some hints from Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and Fantasia....you don't have to lose clear business communications in making the visuals irresistibly immersive like great music! MAKE IT A DESTINATION!!!"
"I've keep on continuing subscriptions for this app (Premium Duo) as I have no problem using it. Besides the good and trendy music listening, I still can enjoy the music in background while getting busy with other apps. I highly recommended to use high-tech in ear wireless headphone to experience digital sound clarity and high bass music. It's addictive. Thank you."
"Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world. Basic functions such as playing music are totally free, but you can also choose to upgrade to Spotify Premium. ... Build collections of music and podcasts. And more! You can try it and i am 100% sure you will love itüñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üíöüíöüíöüíö"
Spotify is the only music source I use to listen to a wide variety of songs and podcasts. The monthly fee for my family plan is extremely 5reasonable. I've discovered so many new artist using Spotify's weekly playlists that I quit counting a long time ago.
"I use premium and the experience is superb. Can listen to it with or without wifi(for downloaded songs). They even specially create playlists for me every week :), helps me explore songs! (only thing is that when using through safari, it will stop after one song and you will have manually press for it to continue, quite irritating but the in app experience is amazing)"
"Absolutely fantastic. Yes there are ads, but thats every free game that requires wifi. Don't like ads? Buy premium! I would recommend this to anybody who doesn't have it. If I could rate 6 stars, I would."
"My favorite music app I use. All the effects are simple and easy to use, and I love the quilty options for the downloads. Keep it up Spotifyü§ô"
"1million songs in your pocket. I have used premium service for almost 3years. Really enjoy it. The quality of the sound can be set in settings and if you have a good set of earphones, it's worth the listen. Interface could be more intuitive and equaliser settings not so difficult to set."
"This is an easy and intuitive App to use. I love that it can stream in very High Quality, as I have no data restrictions. The difference is clear. I don't even look at Pandora anymore. Spotify has earned it's top position in my opinion. üëçüèªüòéüëçüèª"
"Changed back to 5 stars. The UI as it is now is useful, informative and not buggy. A lot more enjoyable experience!"
I was forced to switch to Spotify due to my favorite parcast podcasts only playing on here now. I can't figure out how to not the episode automatically go to the next. Turning off the autoplay button didn't work. The only reason I'm giving Spotify 5 stars and not 4 is because I find it soooo awesome that the podcasts episodes come with transcripts. That's something that my old podcast app didn't do. I had to download another app to accommodate this shortcoming but w/Spotify I don't need it üòä
"It is very good but there is a glich in app when we connect to wireless headphones , and once we listen a song and then if get out completely of the app and then if we use headphone buttons then the song runs without opening app and it is a glich i hope you understood it and definitely try it once"
Functions perfect with download time on data or wifi everything is easy to access. With a perfected app though that could be developed further with payment options for official music videos in a 00.25$ option beside each song that could/would/possibly be added to the phone bill which i find is honestly the best method of payment in any purchase related interaction as its safe and no information is required the bill just increases and a safe more compact method of payment is felt ? o.O
This is one of the best things to have especially if you want to game or are busy with work or other things. This is a good app but I really want a organization button for your playlist that way you know what song is coming.
"Being a developer myself, I admire the UI design of this application. It's minimalistic design with right colour combinations and strong algorithms used to recommend similar songs are remarkable. These are enough points to make me use this stunning app."
"Great experience! the art, the music, the design and the access being the perfect piece to a high and deep adventure of listen and feel Spotify like a Marterpiece. Successful listen process to everybody."
"Found all my favorites and some good new music here. Commercials seem to be a fair trade off for good, free, guided music. Thanks Spotify."
Lots of great music on Spotify. Also many and varied artists to suit all tastes and preferences. There is lots of music for everyone. There is plenty of music for everyone to enjoy.
"Ive used spotify almost every day for the past 5 or so years, and i have only had a few issues that were quickly resolved. If i could give more than 5 stars, I would."
Only thing that could make this app better would be the ability to see all songs in your library. But it doesn't have to be perfect for me to say that Spotify Premium easily offers the best user experience of all music streaming services I've ever tried (as of the Spotify app's most recent updates). I'd highly recommend it to anyone.
Overall really good. A lot of pretty good updates recently. One thing that would be really cool is if you could duplicate other playlists made by other users. This way if someone made a playlist with a bunch of songs you liked except for maybe a few. You could duplicate your own version and make adjustments that make the playlist more suitable for you. It's hard to make these big 100+ song playlists. A duplication feature could cut that time to make the playlist down.
"With Spotify, now I am exploring and enjoying music more. This has been possible thanks to their intuitive UI, music quality, and the abundance of the titles available."
"Love listening to music and not having to click a button every 5 minutes to keep the music going. Plus, it's not nearly as battery draining as that ""other"" app."
"Large variety of music. Because of the large number of songs available, it will be great if it could smoothly transition to the next song after a designated duration (2' or 3')."
"Really amazed to enjoy the quality of sounds as well as all easy to use ui, features and so on. It gave me 3 months premium services just because of I have Samsung Device and thanks goes to Spotify and Samsung."
"I like audio quality, large catalog of songs and artists, UI and an option to download and listen to music offline. It is nice to have notifications from artists I follow."
"I love this app i play music while im doing house work, while at work, and in family gatherings i build my own folders n download and listen exactly to what I chose to listen too, i chose with no commercials, I love it."
"Aside from the ads, the music was selected according to my tastes, and quite enjoyable and continuous, like radio."
It's a good app but I do wish that I could make my own Playlist and not have them add song similar to it. It is quite annoying but I still gave it a 5 because it showing me other songs that I've never heard since I barley listen to new music. But it still a great thing because you're able to look at other Playlist with is cool to listen to my friends music. They do have ads but that's in pandora as well so not such a surprise.
"The app is great but the customer service is amazing. Had some billing issues and contacted them thru chat on their web site. Had everything straightened out quickly and they issued a refund immediately. Good product backed up by good support, cant beat that."
"Been using Spotify for years, I have premium and I have to say it's just overall amazing. Genuinlyove this music app and it works on all phones ( I have Android so I'm not sure about Apple ) its kept all my favorite jams for a long time couldn't live life without it."
"Spotfiy has literally changed the way I live life ahaha. Being able to download all my favorite songs, and discovering new favorites through the personalized playlists is so dank. Also, the fade out - fade in feature is really satisfying. However, the only thing I wish for, is a shuffle all type of button, because sometimes I really couldn't be bothered with looking for a song or a playlist to listen to."
"Overall a great experience with the app, though the ads sometimes get very annoying. And no I won't buy premium, quit asking."
"it's has all that i need in a music app. Good app ,UI is awesome than any other music application, audio quality is good even in non premiere version.Daily playlist is an awesome feature, album art is good."
"Less commercials than YouTube music, continues to.play when surfing the internet unlike YouTube . Automatically sends Playlist similarly to your tastes where you can pick the ones you like. 30 minutes ad free when you choose to listen to a commercial.ii have more than 5,000 songs on spodify and growing. I have Pandora,YouTube music and Spodyfy. Spodify is the best and easiest of all for building your music library and enjoying it bar none."
"I love Spotify. I recently purchased spotify premium, and it is like luxury. You can download music in high quality, and my speaker loves the amount of bass coming from this app. Hughley suggested."
"A huge Spotify fan boy here, I've been using it for years now and will never leave it. The UI is so slick compared to all the others that I've experienced. High fives all round to the Devs! ‚úãüèª"
Very nice üëåapp.Best app for listening to add free music and podcasts. The other thing I love about this app is its UI.Music quality is just awesome üëåand the best the thing I love is it's music suggestions for all types.
So far spotify has been my music spot. Have had the oportunity to be a premium user for a while and it was nothing short of being the best music spot for me. Easy tonuse and the customer support provided is there and on piont. Thanks and continue to keep up the good work. My name is Manuel Anguiano and im a Spotify user.
"Great app for all your music wants and necessities, but it would be nice to be able to have two accounts in case something happens to your mobile device requiring you to get another one because I have music on another account that I like to add to my current account or if that possible have two accounts."
It's a great music app and it's pretty easy to control it just needs a little more graphics for the background but all in all I use it almost everyday.
"Im going to make this quick. There are no ads, and you can listen to the music without it having to be on ur screen and without ur device screen having to be on and much more!"
"Love it. There's a lot of songs you can listen to. The only thing is the ads,they are quite annoying. But I love Spotify and use it almost everyday."
"I have been enjoying Spotify for over a year now. Love it. Only complaint I have is a play button glitch, but I did doesn't have the problem, and I can still play a different way."
The UI is perfect for me and the suggested playlists actually recommend music that's alone the lines of what I'd listen to. Glad I switched from Pandora.
I like this music app because of its lack of advertisement pauses. I also like it's intuitive suggestions for playlists. No more Pandora!!
"Hey spotify, a quick suggestion...if you could include an option of setting the frequency of either newest songs first or either older songs first in shuffle, it would be grateful. Thanks"
"Can't afford premium so we get alot and lots of those non required unnecessary free ads all the time.... As per my view, there's an continous popping of ads after every single song/music played. And then, this App's ads primary contents being generally with an aim Or else purposely goal to intentionally downgrade all those specific ad viewing individual of the unsubscribe premium' Spotifycommunity. IDK how other region's server works but honestly speaking this Adsucks it all here in IndianRegion"
I really like Spotify but I see people complaining about shuffle being always on yet I can only play linearly. I want to play in shuffle but I don't even see a shuffle button or repeat button. Where are they?
Lately (since the last three updates) the app is running much more smoothly than before. It's just something I wanted to point out. The lags when playing a song or browsing though the catalog are rare now (they used to happen quite a bite before). Congrats to the excellent work.
"Brilliant app to serve songs along with true high quality sounds. It's not an app, it's a friend actually. Such a cool UI."
Only one thing that shd be changed is that they put interfering adds and say tgat hear song without any interference So pls don't put too many adds Rest everything abt Spotify is just tooooo goood. All thanks to Spotify my lockdown has been going quite smoothly and pls give lyrics Everyone is getting lyrics but somehow I don't have lyrics on my Spotify app
"In general I love the app. But there is one small detail that bothers me a lot, it is hitting accidentally the ""unlike"" button and removing from liked songs. Some buttons have a notification to confirm, but others don't. Please make notifications for all, or better hide that button for already liked songs in order to be available only on the 3 point menu."
"My most used app. Spotify has replaced almost everything I use for listening to music. Simple clean interface and layout and almost any song I can think of. The premium version is great as it allows you to download songs and listen to them offline, although it is quite expensive"
"I just think it's great to have such a vast repertoire, quite litterally, at your finger ( and ear ) tips. Long may it continue."
"Not as simple and straightforward as Google Music (RIP) but definitely not the cluttered counter intuitive shitshow that is Youtube Music, catalogue great, the lists and suggestions interesting etc..."
"Best music app ever - I love to listen music daily and Spotify has made easier for me to listen to latest songs, download them and play offline without worrying about sorting and finding them on multiple devices. I love the UI and everything, but it'll be better if they 'll introduce a new widget for Android users cuz the current one looks pretty old styled."
"It's easy to use and is free! Getting premium is optional and not required. To rap it all up, this is a great app that you should try. I just wish I could pick the exact song I wanna hear."
this app is the best. has every song i want to listen. and all of the artists i requested earlier are now on Spotify. thank you! and iknow you guys want to make money but please lower the ads. I'm in love with the new UI.
By far the best designed music streaming app out there! My favourite feature is the ability to use my phone as a remote while I listen on other devices. I highly recommend Spotify.
"New UI is great, finally put search back at top of playlists without hiding under a button and new playbutton is streamlined. First UI update in a long time that wasnt a step backwards!"
Spotify is one of the best apps for music on the market. With the option to create your own unique playlists as well as have them built around your own personal musical tastes...you cant beat that. You are able to follow artists you enjoy as well as other folks who enjoy the music you do. Only suggestion I have is a chat option. You also have podcasts here. Michele Obama and Barack have two of the best ones on here. It's like listening in on conversations with family members.
"There are many sites available for the use by individuals with discrimanating taste in music.Many of these sites are not in the highest of catalog,though many are great ,for my listening requirements the hard to obtain is sometimes in my requests.Spotify without compair can fullfill your need.Take a chance and try to stump them,good luck!"
"This app is amazing, all I do is listen to music all day and don't get interrupted at all, with premium it's amazing, although it does drain the battery to my phone quite a bit"
Great app. Even the free version is great. I think Spotify should add a built-in Equaliser for the speakers when using a Bluetooth speaker
This is my second time for having Spotify I had another phone and lost it had to cancel Spotify get it again after about a year and a half I lost my whole playlist I hope to get it back if not I'm going to build a new one and I'm confident Spotify has all the music I need to listen to they are very good before and I'm confident that having it on my new phone it will be just as good music can save a person's soul or even his life at the most inappropriate time you think if you hear it in the back
"Ever since discovering Spotify I've never looked back. Not one for ads popping up and not being able to skip songs, I've subscribed and never regretted it since. It's my go-to for the gym, cruising, doing chores. Definitely recommended."
"I love the app. I've had premium for like 5 years now and I've never had problems with it, it's really well built. I just wish, just one thing, that you are able to queue recently played songs(in search tab). Same like the options when you regularly search up a song. Like hold down the song the recently played song that you want to queue and it will give up the options. That's just one thing I would really like."
"I absolutely love Spotify! The UI, the recommendations, the features! I was very sceptical about buying the premium, but it's totally worth it! 100%. Never leaving Spotify for any other music app. Team Spotify for life :p If there was a DM feature where I could share songs with my friends directly, it would definitely be a great addition."
Quite a friendly app with lots of options to keep your selected songs. Quick and easy search for songs which is a great thing for music lovers.
"i love this app because it continues to get better. they improve the ui very often, making it easier to navigate and find new music. the aspect I want them to focus on moving forward is the social aspect and adding customization to the profiles to give more purpose to viewing and following other users. I can trust Spotify to move forward and commit to improving their already great app which is why it is miles ahead of their competitors."
"Spotify offers best-in-class features and an intuitive user experiences, paired with an extremely expansive selection of music and podcasts. Unfortunately, it's a bit lacking in the sound quality department if you're looking for audiophile-grade streaming. I wanted to yield them a 4.5 but u fortunately cuz it isnt available i gave them a 5 after a round off:) Overall this app is blessing for all of using it out there in the world. And yea one supreme thing is to buy the premium for ezz:)"
"It's on my phone, TV and computer all synced up, and I use the free version. No, the ads are not like Saavn nagging after each song. Though I have an annual subscription for Wynk, I use this one as my primary because of its UI and nicely segregated content. Be it Android Auto or Shazam, every standard interface has its plug in. Customised playlists of random users, new releases of my preferred artists and genres, etc."
"Love ability to make playlists for any and every occasion! Adding, moving or removing songs is quick and simple. Spotify is the only music app I use and the price is right, even for Premium."
I love Spotify. I tried all the other options available and decided on Spotify as it has a great variety of music to stream that suits my music tastes.
"Best fun Best music Best Everything Something for everyone ~~~~~ Only quibble, finding the people who make the playlist could be a lot easier It's currently far too complex for a simple brain like mine."
"Great app. Super user friendly and intuitive. Amazing selection of music, podcasts, etc. Only issue I have is they have chosen to disable the ability to play my old iTunes play lists. Which I understand business wise but it was nice for the consumer."
"Extremely intuitive and easy to navigate. The layout is straight forward, downloading is fast and all in all, runs smoothly. Strongly recommend it."
"Big fat meaty 5 stars to spotify! Smooth streaming, great ui, offline play and personalized music discovery options make spotify even better than illegal pirating options for music. My one and only app review goes to the app I use every single day."
"This app has been my top choice for playing music for a long time and has been doing a good job. But recently, that experience has suffered quite a lot. The app is being extremely buggy lately and is making the app borderline unusable at times. And based off of other recent reviews of this app, I'm not the only one experiencing issues like this. Random crashes, stops playing music, and redownloading songs that have been download for a long time."
"Removing a star because you took away the widget feature. One of my favorite things about this app was the homescreen widget. Made it way safer to navigate through my music while drivig because I didnt have to make any extra gestures to get to my next song or to turn shuffle mode on. And heads up, UConnect 4 in my Dodge doesn't mesh well with this new version. Can't operate Spotify on any of my center console buttons. Google music works just fine so I can't say for sure whats up."
"The is one the best, most entertaining, the very best music app you can ever have on your device. Just a little amount to become a premium user, and Stream songs unlimited songs. So if you're a new user, hit that download button. Kudos to the developers."
"I've always been able to find my music I want to listen to right away, very quickly. I have the utmost love and respect for this music app (Spotify: Listen to Music you Love)."
"I can find music to listen to while I'm playing games, chatting, or watching movies, and I've never been a fan of country music üé∂until 1995 when my guests were visiting family and friends. I let them take over the music üé∂ and I have been a country fan since.i still love my rock and I will listen to the music quite often, especially when I'm alone. I definitely recommend that you try it. 4.5‚òÜs"
5 stars easily but I do have a small problem with the ads. I have premium now but back when I didn't I would turn up my volume a bit at night to hear the music and then an ad for the military with guns blazing and people screaming would pop up on a sleep sound playlist. Other then that it's amazing. They really should try to have more quiet ads on playlist like that
"App not showing in notification panel after the update. In app play buttons aren't being displayed sometimes and are not in sync with Google speaker. Also Observed frequent disconnections with google home speaker after recent updation. Songs are not syncing as well with respect to the speaker playing on Spotify app. App was good before the last two updates, Last two updates have ruined the flawless experience of spotify. Thinking to opt out from the premium service."
Finally a proper UI update in around 5 years. Don't move the playlist search bar from where it is again. I've been waiting for it for too long.
This application is designed greatly and it's too nice. The cool thing about this application is there is almost no annoying ads and that's why I love this. I faced only a problem when I put a playlist in Google's Alarm application it's not working . I don't know whose is creating problem Spotify or Google's Alarm app. Please solve it.
Thank you so much for this excellent app. This app is so carefully designed for all music lovers. I am enjoying it even when the network is slow that too free. I sometimes feel guilty that I am enjoying all these goodies without spending a penny. But don't worry I will upgrade my membership to premium one of this days.
It has a wide music variety and is all around great. I have premium and it is totally worth it in my opinion. Granted it doesn't have EVERY single song but it has quite a lot of songs.
Spotify is the Netflix of Music Streaming. The algorithm truly is exceptional in coming up with reccomendations. The UI is really smooth even when you want it to work across devices. It doesn't have annoying lags. On the whole this probably has all the music you're looking for plus more and really well put together playlists to keep you exploring.
"I got this app and some wireless earbuds on a whim after my mood and mental state started to worsen at work with the consistent pestering of co workers trying to tell me every single little detail going on in their lives for hours at a time instead of getting their work done, then bugging me to help them. This app has definitely brightened my mood and I don't have to listen to them unless they're asking genuine questions! Thank you Spotify for being my new peace of mind!"
"I have premium, and it's quite amazing, and for a while i didn't have premium, and they gave us a lot of apps, but the family premium account is pretty affordable for 6 premium accounts so i rate it 5 stars. You can see what others are listening to and download podcasts and songs and create ur own playlists"
Hands down the best possible experience i could ever expect from a streaming site i love when i pick a song and it intuitively picks the next ones as if its literally reading my mind i have ranted exhaustively to many people how much i absolutely love it! I hate that its always listening to you when its on though
"I think 10 dollars is a bit too expensive, and radio button is a bit far away. Desktop app has some bugs, we need a 64 but version of Spotify for PC not a 32 but one..... otherwise it's 5 Stars üòç"
"I'm definitely satisfied with Spotify, I've bend and loyal fan for quite some time now. I'm definitely and huge jazz fan, and I love about Spotify you can pick your favorite and also there artists you made not yet herd of to get and chances to spotlight them and add to your collection I definitely recommend Spotify to my family and friends."
"Love creating my own Playlist, no ads, unlimited skips and the family plan is a great bargain. Theres been some glitches but they are fixed pretty quickly. Love that they've made casting so easy."
I love this app. I am taking piano lessons and it is very helpful to be able to quickly find the song and listen to it as many times as you need to. It also suggests other music that I may like that I would have never found on my own
Very convenient and has lots of music. Their music discovery system is excellent. Sound quality is quite good too if you max it out in the settings.
"Loved the experience of playing music on Spotify. Their subscription is also such that it does not burn a hole in your pocket. Also they do not reduce the quality of music just because we are not subscribed to them. Their ads are also designed really well, it's quite fair when they say 'watch this short video and get the next 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening'."
"The best app when it comes to listening. The song recommendations are top notch. The UI is just too good. And every 6 months spotify will give stats about our listening too. And it has podcasts too. Almost every single podcasts I have listened before are available here. So I switched to Spotify now. All this good experience with the free version. Yes, there will be ads often if you're using the free version like me but it's worth to buy the premium version. And it tempts me to go for premium."
Spotify is a great platform for music or podcasts Even without premium. Although you still get ads they aren't usualy that long (like 10-30 seconds Max) and then you can listen to a few songs before you get another one. Premium offers the same but more without the ads which is quite Nice. I would deffenetly recomend since premium isnt too expensive (like 15$ a month)
"I love music and this my most favourite app on the phone. First things first, music quality is awesome. Then the UI is aesthetic. Awesome personalization. Get to follow other people and listen to their playlists. So many types of categorisation. Best app for music."
free spotify has tons of commercials but for 9 bux a month all that goes away there's not very much I've searched and didn't find overall I have no complaints I have an android and the app works just fine for me
I have used Spotify for 5 years now and it is incredible. After trying almost every major competitor- I always return. However there's only 2 features that will surely cancel out what the competitors offers 1. The option to switch between a 'light' mode as the UI is only in black and 2. The option to download songs individually without having to add them to a playlist and then download. The best music app out there ! A must have. Work on light/dark mode pleaaaaseüòÅ
"A world of sound!!!!! Endless variety of music, stories, podcasts and entertainment all through a classy provider. An audible compact design, and all at ears reach!!!! Its money well spent for the audiophile."
"I uninstalled several weeks ago. First I want to thank you for saving my lists.This is my most favorite app.I live on a mountaintop in TN.in beautiful place God made and forgot.The bad thing is that it is impossible to get quality internet service.I look forward to day when i find way to better signal. Some days is struggle to do anything here.I keep sound off cause songs won't play thru.Download time for 1 song unreal. If you love music,this is place to be! RayHo back in building folks!!!"
This is a well made app for music it let's you design your own playlists and makes playlist based on what you listen to all in all this is a great app for music even if you dont have premium
"Update: the app has improved and worked better over time, even though there are slight improvements to go. I migrated to spotify due to JRE, and this app needs some attention to allot of bugs. I cant listen to a single podcast without constantly dealing with self pausing, button play/pause mismatch, app constantly gos back to main screen and i have to go through the whole process to pause it...."
All I can say is i would like to have a dislike button for a certain bands. So you don't have to go hide certain songs in the playlists you can just dislike the band.
Finding music that caters to your style has never been more easier to find. Great app design and interface coupled with plenty of in depth configuration settings makes Spotify probably the best music app you can find.
"Affordable, reliable, and honestly a really good platform. Had YouTube music (that comes with YouTube Premium) for quite awhile then one day a PERMANENT adult filter was added to EVERYTHING (no more explicit music, content, and YouTube videos). I am 20 years old and pay for my services. Was not pleased with YouTube after this. I did not receive any help either. It was stuck. And even currently my YouTube account won't let me watch pretty much anything:/. But this platform is really great."
"Easy to use, seems to have a greater inventory than some of the other excellent systems. Creating Playlist and finding them in the library is quick and simple."
"I wish they had a built-in feature to play audio files downloaded on a device so I didn't need a separate music app. But the app does everything it sets out to do and does it well, so it still deserves 5 stars"
"Amazing, Amazing, and Amazing control of what you want to listen to. Choices of Genre and types of songs are endless. The GUI is awesome. The ability t organize all of your songs is out of this world..Kudos Spotify....."
"I have been using Apple Music, Deezer and Yandex.Music before. And Spotify is the best music app for me! It works perfect, has the biggest library of the music and has the greatest design. The multi-device sync is crazy, cause I can control music playing on one device using another and I use often So I highly recommend it for you)"
"My Favourite Music app! I have tried many other apps available there and believe me it's the best; with the best UI,quality music,easy controls and comparatively less annoying ads..Hit the Install button now.."
I enjoyed setting my own playlist finding phones that I haven't heard and quite a long time so many variety you have to choose from is there a way that I can get this without having to renew my prescription every month how about you just run until I stop it that's what I like that's what I would enjoy
"Everything is great. Although thwre is one little problem that is concerning me. Whenever I turn my Redmi phone into dark mode, the play/pause button becomes invisible. I know this is not a big deal, but it is kinda annoying for me. Would be glad if you could fix that."
"Great app for Android Update 5/26/21: using Spotify app on Samsung galaxy note ultra 20 running Android. App stops playing podcast at random times. The ""now playing"" bar at bottom of the screen shows inaccurate podcast title and is intermittently non-functional (pause/play buttons)."
"I don't know what you guys did with the new update but I can't even scroll through my music or podcasts anymore. Everything is out of order and it seems like the sort button keeps getting pressed every time I try to look through anything. It jumps around from top to bottom and won't load right when I click on a podcast or song. It also has been force closing. Please look into it, I love this app, pay for it and use it every day."
I am a Wynk user. Downloaded Spotify and found the music quality is awesome and UI design is great. Lakhs of songs. Became a premier member now. Uninstalled Wynk.
"Simple, intuitive interface, amazing music suggestion and playlists, great audio quality and other features. Brilliant app."
I love listening to music on this app my favorite thing is that there's not that many ads and you have a choice that you don't have to listen to ads for 30 minutes I love this and it's so quick to install I hope other people have a great experience with the app just like I did I'm a hundred percent team Spotify
"Easy to build up and keep library, free to play any song on desktop. I used to be broke and didn't have much money Spotify always let's you listen to your music even if you don't have money. Keep your libraries forever, anywhere. It's been great I can like songs and come back. Think I've been using Spotify since my freshman year 2017, now graduated and got a whole nostalgic trip of lists of songs I like. Spotify was always the best deal, you get much more than any music streaming competitor."
"The interface, options and features are quite satisfying in this app. Also, the way they show ads without harshly interrupting the listener feels somewhat peaceful. They also cover good to excellent music library in all languages. If you're fond of listening to English music then you're at the right place. I recommend Spotify over any other apps like Jiosaavn and/or Wynk."
Best of breed. I've tried others but still keep coming back to a company that does music streaming really well. App is ready to use and the UX is pretty friendly.
"Seem less, well built software. Spotify covers everything from podcasts to weather to any music you like live versions rare versions they tend to have everything"
OK spotify I'm paying for premium I should be able to open the app and play my music without having to wait. There's an annoying glitch that's been going on for some time now every time I open the app it says I have no internet connection and I'm forced to wait for it to buffer or load up and realize that I am connected to a network.. You guys need to fix this issue. Apparently it's happening to quite a few people so it's not just me or a problem with my phone it's a problem with the app.fix it
"It's so good, and useful for music listeners, Unless they are familiarise on how to get through it all, very beautiful songs, that for years, I couldn't get all in one copy, (rather use to get link from other sources) But this one is very useful and it's related to our kind of music samples, before we can ""save"" to my own playlist album. No doubt, add at a time of few songs, (what do we expect?, E'thing free ?)Better than radio Helps for my music learning in guitar,violin,flute,harmonica,piano"
"Been away for a year with Amazon Unlimited but like others I've tried, its messy, buggy and the playlists are poor. This is like picking me songs much more my taste and also the app and whole thing is better. The only thing is amazon was cheaper but id pay the 2 quid extra for a song on demand that I search for on tap rather than try and hunt the album or song. It's the best for mobile as if I wanted higher quality tracks eg WAVS, I'd buy them or something. Its also on my PS4 too, more options"
"The best ever, all the music and songs i love, including the most beautiful quiet piano and oldies such as Jim Reeves, etc and the quality of the recordings is stunning. Thank you SPOTIFY!"
"Amazing app, it has all the songs I beed, even some really obscure ones. The integration with other devices is amazing, the ui is clean, and it's everything I could ask for."
it used to be quite minimum but now ads are getting out of the hand. edit : finally available in my country! price is quite reasonable. few songs are disabled though.
the indian app is no where like the original one. there is no shuffle play button no radios nothing. there are only advertisements for premium every two songs. many songs are missing from the original database.
"Spotify aims at a good user experience. There are features that are missing considering a music app but the fetures that are present works flawlessly. And combined with its large database of music I think it is easily ahead of other similar apps like Gaana, Wynk, Apple Music. The only reason I would choose to use other app is the price."
Absolutely great music app till date. I switch the app because it's interfere is very easy to use and just click on play button then enjoy to seamless music.
"Great app! Great UX! Two suggestions though: 1. Whenever we listen to a playlist, the next time we click on it, all the songs that haven't been listened to should automatically come on top. 2. We need a 'Listened' button next to 'Liked' button cause sometimes we only want to keep in mind that we've listened to this song but don't want to add it to 'Liked' songs. Thanks!"
The new library is absolutely outstanding Mind blowing free app to listen all the songs in all languages and podcasts. Continuing to love this app as for the last 6 years üëçüëçüëçüëå
The experience?... Best (Just use the paid version and you are good to go) It's so versatile and I have not problem accessing it from my different devices and continuing to listen to the song that I was listening to.
"I have such a great experience with spotify. I am student and Spotify comes with such a low price that I can afford easily and its adjustable with my pocket money. If we talk about music, Spotify has a large number of artist and their tracks. The also have many categories of different moods. I really recommend this app. Spotify offer different price plans and you can choose which suites you the most. I am lovin' it. More food than SoundCloud"
"A great app for mucic lovers but the only small dislike of these app is about the most ads.As for every two to three songs there is an ad and even the ads have skip option but the design,performance, playlists,songs collection are awesome."
Spotify makes into my Top 3 apps in the world which I can't live without. Interactive UI and visual experience is undeniably industry leading ! Great Great Great service üëåüëç 5/5 Stars
"Amazing app for music; wide variety if stuff for a guy like me who listens to all types of music. It also has great podcasts, so I don't get bored in class and I can just stop paying attention XD. They're even self-conscious about how much ads suck, unlike mobile games or other websites that want to shout them from the rooftop. Premium is a little expensive ($10/month), but well worth it. This is BUILT for music and podcasts, and by hell does it succeed."
"Great App. This app is great for my purpouses, you can listen to the music you want whenever! Although when you are looking for music to listen to out and about look elsewhere, you cant listen to music offline :( But if you get Spotify Premium, you can download music and listen to it ad free. The ads are quite annoying, and one thing i have been noticing is when i listen to my playlist, it always shuffle plays ( unless you are listening on desktop) its not a big problem but hope they fix it soon"
"I love Spotify because, it's easy to search for the songs, it's easy to build your playlist and I love that it makes suggestions based on your taste of music. I'm a 60s-70s child and love that they have a huge play list of bubblegum music. It's nice to remember my teenie bopper days of youth listening to the likes of Tony DeFranco, Leif Garrett, Shawn Cassidy and Bobby Sherman! ü•∞"
Great app for music lovers. The UI is easy to comprehend plus the suggestions are good too. I even liked how they categorise each years top Hits. No isuues so far with searching for my favourite songs. A thanks for the Spotify team.
"Important info for those who are facing annoying critical Spotify music play interruptions, in my case once I executed April-2021 Android firmware update, the Facebook app started fall down with automatic restart while all running apps including Spotify was affected. It was happening in phone absolutely quietly, just all apps stopped and restarted w/o any warning many times per hour, incl. Spotify. Once I disabled Facebook app the issue immediately disappeared."
The best music app in the universe with spotify connect its one of the best app in playstore a way way better than other apps in playstore that are frod and show you only ads less music. 10001% satisfaction from the builders. Spotify premium membership is also value for money no extra cost full value i am love with this app.
"Dynamic audio files, huge libraries, and intuitive music A.I. for selection recommendations, Spotify is definitely the go-to app for music listening."
I am using spotify for 3-4 years. Its a great app i cant compare spotify to other apps beacuse spotify have many features and beautifull and simple UI. I love the recommandation in spotify playlist. Everyone should use it once. Perfect app 5/5
"Hi. I work in a big shed on my own and I find the endless playlists great to pass the day. Whatever type of music you fancy and, after you get tired of that style you can experiment. Everything is there. Aaand then you can start building your own playlists. It really is good if you use it and make it work for you. Senan"
"I ‚ô° this app! Infact I‚Äôm listening to a song right now! I really appreciate it because I‚Äôm in in Australia and I used to live in America, where they had different kinds of song apps. I am just so grateful for it! It‚Äôs extremely simple and quick with just a few clicks! Thee only thing is, in witch I completely understand, is it is a PAIN to log-in but it‚Äôs totally worth it for the music in the end. There‚Äôs A LOT of songs that go into all kinds of categories! I really recommend this. ‚ÄîS.E.F.F:-)))"
"I hope my review will not be biased, I started with a free trial, and by the end of it upgraded to Premium, so I may have missed some annoying ads. I just thought to try something new, but it was love at first sight. Spotify understands me better than I can ever hope to understand myself. We are still getting to know each other, and it's quite a shorthand we have developed so far. I like how it looks and behaves, it's easy and pleasant to work with. Sometimes we have a bad week and I don't approve the choice made for me, but I know we will get along. And we do, always. Just a few words to contribute to those who cannot afford Premium. Dear Developers, please be kinder to them. Make ads less annoying, make visual ads but don't touch the playback (or touch it more gently and less often). You have such a great product, it's unfair the users are divided into those who enjoy and those who suffer."
its insane and for the people that are complayning about the non premium thing and the ads just think of how they are supposed to get money especially if the have to pay so many people... ( btw the ads happened after it was bought by microsoft..) and microsoft ruined so many other apps but yea... great
Good app. Free Spotify isnt as annoying people say it is but i ended up getting the premium version regardless. First of all its cheap and very affordable and makes it easier to use as I can now download songs to listen to offline. Im sure people can spare 3 quid to pay for premium plus you even get 1 month free to make sure if you really want it. Another great feature is when i use spotify on my pc i can use my phone as a remote to choose what i want to listen to when im busy gaming. 5 stars
"I'm currently unable to listen to anything because apparently ""no internet connection available"". I have tried all troubleshooting and have just emailed customer support. Will wait on a response and update here. Edit: a quick response by email from the Spotify team when I emailed them, and they asked me to re-install the app. And thay solved the problem. Back to 5 stars."
"Love how a simple day can be much better using Spotify. Unexplainable how it can literally know Evey song you are thinking about or want to hear, truly appreciate all hard work put in to make everything accessible at a click if a button."
"Honestly I thought paid streaming platforms were a scam since you can download songs and podcasts offline. Turns out I'm wrong! Spotify makes life easier with it's (Clean design, High quality songs and podcasts, Easy to use program, Great recommendations) and much more! Spotify is just perfect the way it is, I don't think anything could be further improved. It's just perfect! Edit: I'm using Spotify premium, The free version is a little bit annoying with the ads and skip limits."
"My go-to music app, hands down.ü§ó I get it, that their way of advertising is so that we can be part of their premium services, but damn. üòí Apart from that, its the best music/podcast streaming app there is, infact I even come across to new music everyday that I genuinely see myself enjoying. üòò In many languages too. üéâ Its best because you also get to support your friends favorite artists and creators, and keep track of what you enjoy. üíú"
"Had some issues with podcast playback, but reached out to their customer support and they were very quick to reply and fixed the issue. Great customer support!"
One of the best music streaming platform available with very less ads shifted to this app from others due to this reason. Currently I am not able to buy premium because the plan I want requires monthly payment and my card is not supporting it will definitely go for premium once I buy a new card
"I love it, especially the podcast selection. Wish the UI gave the user more control on Android. I noticed I had to use my pc ...other than that, it is pretty dope!!"
The only thing that sets apart from other music apps is UI . Spotify has this cool looking thing and since i am premium user the desktop app is different from normal user.
"The only program where you can listen to your favorite artists and tracks even rebuild your favorite tracks for whatever you want in playlists to your favorite albums it's a totally awesome whey to listen to your favorite tracks by downloading all fav music in one custom made library of all the timeless tunes hand picked by only you. I have more than enough tracks to create my very own rock radio station. All I can tell you is turn it on, crank it up and enjoy all this enjoyable app has to offer"
Fantastic all round I love all of my recommendations it gives way better than Google play music and Apple music in my opinion I've had google play music and Apple iTunes music thing and quite honestly Spotify out dose them all like it actually gives you music that you would love depending on your interests and such thankyou Spotify
I love it. I get to worship and dance and experience new artists. It's also affordable and the graphics are brilliant. Still hoping the downloading feature could work a little more faster. The different genres and categories are luxury thus I have a plethora of music to choose from and even for meditation. How I would love if there were more South African artists and their music. Awesome App!
I just love how i am able to access a lot of music on just one app...but moat importantly the playlists suit everyone regardless of the genre of music they into. Nice one
"I never write reviews, and since I've has spotify premium for years I figured there wasn't much of a ppint, but GUYS, they just did a tiny update wuere you can automatically filter the genre of all of your liked songs. As someone who has many moods and over 2000 songs downloaded, this is GENUIS! Its a lifesaver, now I don't have to waste as much time skipping dozens of songs to find my mood OR put hours into building playlists from my liked songs!!! BRILLIANT, Spotify."
Spotify is one of my most favorite music streaming app ever I prefer Spotify to other music players or apps because it simple and better and easy doesn't take up too much storage or the download and offline isn't that bad pretty quick and fast to download to offline it has it glitches at moments on the playlist the downloaded green check Mark's keep uninstalling some my music very annoying at some parts... but I been with spotify since 2016 or 2017 I think 6 to 7 years now but I still love it!!
"Music always touches my soul and i am so much fond of listening to music üéµüé∂ like an addict. Spotify is the application i only use for the music excluding video streaming but I am not underestimating podcasts üòÖü§©. Really spotify gave alot of opportunities to people to share their ideas, stories, thoughts based on something better and beyond imagination. Music is love üíï, when it hits you, you really feel free and out of space. My brain storms like many ideas storming in my mind right quick."
"It's actually quite nice and easy app to enjoy music,but sometimes the add's became so much Irritating and so as the shuffle option!To cancel that we need to have premium but besides spotify is good to listen and enjoy music globally!"
Spotify is pretty good. The recommendations are on point and the music is great. The UI is user friendly.
"There is no transition gap between songs. Sometimes this can help a lot to not ruin the feeling, if two songs are connected with a transition, but separated as songs."
I love my Spotify. I've been building my favorites list for some time now. My daily sanity at work would be questionable without it. Spotify beats all the others that I've tried.
"This is the first time I'm giving 5 stars. Spotify deserves that. It's the best music streaming application out there. I used its competitor's too. But the UI and UX of this, the way of organizing our playlists and all and the recommendations are exceptional on spotify. When you love music, you'll love spotify from the bottom of your heart. It just makes my music listening experience better and comfortable. I owe a thanks."
Probably one of my longest subscriptions as I've been a member of it for at least 8 years now. When an album is released Spotify has it the same day so I'm always up to date on my favorite artists. The interface is quite easy to use and am able there is infrequently any bugs. Plenty of content on here with podcasts as well.
Spotify is quite simply amazing If you are mad about music and love to hear singers and bands from all over the world. It's quite simple download this now I love music more than ever and it's mainly cause of spotify. The best bit by far is the preview option which let's you listen to a very short burst of the song I can spend ages going through this and finding more and more new artists to listen to and like Thank you Spotify
"A wonderful Musical Platform. It give a pleasant listen experience that doesn't force you to purchase a subscribe with continuous solicitations. Also, the Spotify Platform is quite user-friendly."
"I have the family premium and it works like a charm. Sometimes the app glitches a little bit but its only a minor inconvenience and fixes itself within 3 seconds. If you don't know about spotify it has all the songs you could think of and with premium your able to listen to songs offline and in good quality as well. Spotify keeps getting new updates making the user experience even better. Also their is no limit on number of songs you can download with premium, I have about 1700 songs downloaded."
Earlier I used wynk. I thought it's the best. Then I used Spotify!Man!!! This is amazing. The playlist are very genuine and beautiful. Love the app
"This app is AMAZING. When you first sign in it gives you a choice to pay or not. Im broke so i chose to just have small ads in between my songs but recently spotify had made a little ad saying that if you press a button that says WATCH NOW you will get 30 minutes of ad free music. I think thats a deal to me, plus its only one ad so if you dont want to pay you are in luck. Also it gives people the opportunity to make playlists and to make them visible or not. Follow me at I seem fine but im not"
"So, first off.. wasn't a huge Spotify fan...but, I have quickly converted! Amazing, all in one music app! All the songs, all the play lists right where and when you need them!"
"Excellent song recommendations every week at least better than every other music app out there, plus awesome audio quality. Been using this app since 4years now no issues, love their UI design too."
"What a dream! I was a devout ""Google Play Music"" girl but they did away with the platform & transferred us to YouTube Music, which is garbage. I finally made the switch to Spotify & within minutes was simply delighted with the amazing UI & flawless Sonos integrations. I love that I can like songs from the notification panel, adjust the volume with my volume buttons on the phone, & cast directly to Sonos without having to choose music from within the Sonos app. My audiophile heart is very happy!"
"I like the way spotify suggests a playlist that suits you, based on very few songs that you've listened to. Its like spotify knows me more, with in just few days of our interaction."
"I moved over from another music app. I love the fact that it has my favorite podcasts! Great algorithm recommending songs I might like! One issue I have is that it takes long to connect to my google cast. Has anyone else experienced this. Is it unrelated to spotify, because I've tested my old app and it connects quickly?"
"Was working great, now it wont let me log in. 4/2/21 Working as it should now, I wish there was a way to increase volume more within the app. I listen while working an outdoor job with loud tools and equipment and on my phones max volume I can almost hear perfectly so a volume boost of sorts would really be great. I'm gonna try getting some ear muffs to put on over my ear buds to block out the background noise. But the app is basically perfect for me and doesn't seem to drain my battery bad"
Very to easy to use and navigate on. Got some really good music. Looks a very good and well designed app. Very pleased with it.
I love this app. It has so many stations to choose from to the music from the podcasts. Listening to Sootify makes my work hours go by quicker.
Been using Spotify for near on a decade. It always comes up with useful thing. The only thing that isn't great is the duo playlists don't update all that often. They seem quite full of one partner or the others music rather than a mix depending on who signed into it.
"Excellent interface and huge library of songs. UI could do with some enhancements, especially the search option. Separate the podcast from the music section and add a favourites for podcast too."
"I absolutely love spotify. The way they have build their app, connectivity, host migrations and streaming capabilities. I admire their efforts making an excellent app. The most admirable feature is the similar song suggestion algorithm they have which is as good as or even better than youtube. I have found so many good artists and songs just becaus of that. I really love the app. I am closing my Apple music yearly subscription and switching to Spotify. I absolutely love the app."
"Nice and simple app. I really love the design, but, some there's some music i can't play even if i have a premium membership, like some nightcores/record.. I hope you can update it so i can listen the nightcore version too. Oh and i really love how the audio is delivered it's soft to my ear :3"
"Brilliant app, with a classy, hip design and very user friendly. Love the algorithm it uses to generate personal playlists! Makes listening to music simple, fun and exciting!"
"I absolutely love Spotify! Known about it for years and never tried. A little research first to eliminate the pretenders, then bam!! Just what I require. Great remastered and HD source material... Tman!.."
"Love spotify! I use it all the time...At home on my smart TV. In the car through aux. While doing yard work, cleaning house, taking shower, and more through Bluetooth speaker!"
"I love Spotify because when you stop it, it does not stay on your screen, egging you to play it. Listening to songs is relaxing yet we need to stop it immediately if some pressing work comes. It should not meddle with work such that you feel like that the player is impending your work. Spotify remains when required and goes away when required. I feel that's the best part of Spotify."
"Rare streaming interruptions. Far better UI than competitors i've tried. And a growing and diversifying range of interesting podcasts, find your niche. For music it has a wide range, but there are a few more obscure tracks I haven't found. For context, am a daily listener, ~2-6 hours per day."
"Never listened to so much music. I wish I had this earlier. Premium version is worth the money. Plus no ads. Got it on mobile phone, computer/tablet and TV. No casting required so perfect sound quality."
"All the tunes are in here, i get what i want the way i want it when i want it. Id like to if its possible to get back some of my past play lists? I really dont want to build up another 5000 songs and library all over againü§Ø no what i mean???"
"The android user's best tool to listen to music and podcasts. While it is just as good on apple products, spotify has always been a seamless way to stream and share music across all of my devices. They are also quickly becoming one of the best platforms to listen to podcasts on for me. Overall, would reccomend."
"I'm really enjoying Spotify... I've recently acquired the premium version but because there was a single song that I couldn't find anywhere else üòÇ But I highly recommend both the free version and the premium version. The only thing I haven't discovered is whether or not I can choose to download only one song and not the whole Playlist... tried a few times, no luck. All in all it is a great app with a wide range of music and podcasts."
"It's amazing, I'm so impressed. Every song/music is on this app, and there's many different playlists you can find to suit your type of music !"
My favourite music player with millions of high quality songs... If having premium it's 2x enjoyable... THE UI IS SUPERB THE DOWNLOADING FEATURE IS NICE AND THE PLAYLIST OPTION AND SHARING IT IS ALSO GOOD IF I WANNA RECOMMEND SONGS WHICH I LISTEN TO OTHERS
Great for me to make play lists of my favourite music. Adverts a bit of a nuisance but I use it because it doesn't cost anything so worth it.
"I absolutely love the music choices. The podcasts that are available are amazing as well. I don't pay to have no ads. They really aren't that bad. Overall, I enjoy this app quite a bit."
"The best music application ever. The UI is so good and way better than ""Apple Music"" it's so easy to swipe for que to add to liked songs and the best part a sleep timer."
"Amazing app. One thing I dislike though. There is an ad that says tap this button to watch the ad to get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening, and its annoying."
"Practically the best music app, besides the usual features it has one of the best recommendation system, truly captures your playlist mood. PROS: - great design. - great user experience. - music recommendations. - full set of features with premium. - a really good API if you're a developer. CONS: - crashes on desktop macbook (tolerable though since it's not too frequent) - friends music activity can be a little glitchy. (if you're interested in friends activity)"
"The app that is full of memories with vijay uncle as I am his nephew, and many songs available with out premium also I recommend many of my friends to use Spotify very glad to have Spotify on my phone thank you Spotify team for designing a wonderful app of songs to the world."
"Spotify is the best app that I have ever used for music. It has great song variety, and it's a very rare day when there's a song I can't find. The user interface is intuitive, and, while I have not found a use for every feature, Spotify is certainly my most-used app. It's well worth five stars."
I love the quality of the music and huge library. I like also the built in lyric! The best music app for me. On premium for several years now and still love the app. Keep it up!
"Spotify is undoubtedly the best music platform ever. You can find here literally evrything from all genres of music to stories, podcasts and more. Moreover you can publish your own podcast here using Anchor by Spotify. The lyrics time syncing feature is way too good. It also has a community building feature. Here's a suggestion though - Add features like 'Friend Activity' to Spotify for Android as it is in Spotify for Windows."
"Finally spotify is available in Bangladesh and I am so glad I am able to get the best music experience of all international music artists at the tip of my hand. Tonns of playlists, intuitive sugesstions and there are music of every genre whatever someones taste might be."
"I've had premium for quite a while now and I've had zero issues with the app. Also, the end of the year stuff was pretty awesome, kudos to whomever came up with that."
Excellent music streaming app i have ever seen before.According to my user experience it has been included lot of music categories so it's amazing but it would be more good if music lyrics are included.
"So many Artist are missing ,No KSHMR. Seriously?? So many songs are not playable, but you can explore many more hidden gems. Btw UI feels very clean and smooth."
"The app works perfectly. It's easy to use , quick and efficient. It does not ruin my listening experience by flooding me with ads which is great . It also takes very little data ‚òÑ"
01/10/21 Spotify is great for playing music I want to hear. 03/06/21 My music channel has grown so much over the past few months and I bet seldom use the skip button.
"so if you dont get premium yes there are ads but you get used to them also if you get the app on a computer or iPad you have unlimited skips, i have premium free for six months as part of a Samsung deal but after the time is up i will go back to free because it is quite expensive but overall I love this app so much and it would be the first app for me to reccomend to anyone looking for a music streaming app :)"
"There appeared few glitches recently, the first the most annoying, sometime player interface doesn't work right, you change a track, but album cover isn't changing and time progress bar too. It requires restarting app for back to normal."
"I love spotify. It's very convenient and easy. I like their algorithm, it quickly gives what I'm searching for based on my previous experience. I will 100% recommend"
"The best user experience and interface in music streaming, almost intuitive, the catalogue is amazing. Would give 5 stars but I leave 1 star out for further development and improvement to the platform. To the people at Spotify, well done, you've achieved what Alphabet couldn't despite their enormous resources."
Best user experience for a music app I've had so far. I like the seemless switching between songs and the availability of everything. So far no Hi-Fi option if you want lossless audio but that's not a concern for me.
"This is what a music app should be, I am a free user but It doesn't disturb you much while playing your songs, It gives 1 ad in 30 min and that also is designed so well that it doesn't disturb my peace of mind Pros: 1. Ads are really very very less than jiosaavn 2.They do not repeat the same ads continuously (they always try to change the taste) 3.Vast network of all kinds of music 4.There are no forced ads that will definitely direct you to that product's website Cons: 1. No cons for me"
"Excellent catalogue, intuitive user interface. Excellent music suggestion algorithms. Extremely welcome news concerning non lossy music as standard. Making the best better! Highly recommended!"
"I Love this app! I bump spotify daily and the playlists they send are on hit. I mean there are some cuts I don't like, but I push the button and poof! Never hear it again!! Life is good!."
"Great app! Though I wish the Premium was cheaper, it doesn't really ruin the experience, like other music streaming apps."
honestly i think the premium version is worth it ... if you can i would reccomend getting it . otherwise also it works quite well. it has many artists and a great amount of options having many smaller artistes and having podcasts as well. also love the friends feature though would love to be able to see frnds activity form phone . Great app highly recmended
"Love it only thing I would say is if you are on the play queue and you search for music, when you play a track the play queue should not change it should just stop current music and play the song you have chosen. So you don't have to press extra buttons apart from that I love Spotify"
Love building up my playlists covering music from all decades! Great to be able to download and play at any time! Easy to find songs of choice too üíú
Wild range of songs are available on Spotify as others have but the spacial thing is UI/UX of the app. Fully customer friendly app. Love it.
Genuinely got the best customer support I've seen. They're attentive and reliable. The premium is also definitely worth it and even if you dont hit the premium the free version is brilliant too.
"Intuitive interface. Super easy to use. Very rarely do they not have the music I want to listen to. Also a great way to discover small, up and coming artists."
Spotify has recently been available in Bangladesh. This is a great app to use. As a music lover there is no other app I would chose over spotify. But we need premium version for having the utmost benifit. For this international transaction is required. Not everyone can provide this transaction through credit and debit cards. It would be really great if you add a local payment medium for us.
"It is very user friendly, I have used it for 5 years now and encountered only one issue which was quickly resolved. Edit: i have encountered another issue but have found a solution. Still a great app and would greatly reccomend it."
"What took you guys soo long to reach Bangladesh? Anyhow, I'm using the basic version of this app and it's quite similar to Deezer. The only reason why I'm on Spotify is because of Gorillaz and their G Mixes. Been a huge fan of this band for 20 years and there's no way I can miss any updates on the playlists they make and the new songs they add on to those playlists. Unlike Deezer, there's 1 useful feature on this app and that is, that you can easily hide the songs you don't want to listen to."
"I've been using Spotify for well over a year now and I can say that if it ceases to exist I would probably cease to exist too ü§£ The amount of new music I have found is priceless. I don't care about the app's bugs, etc, I haven't come across any that ruin the experience for me. Love this to death!"
"It is the best ever music streaming app,I ever used.But here are some suggestions.Please try to apply it- 1.EQUILAZER is not available in lower devices. 2.Please add a chat conversation between our friends. 3.Please add more songs which are available in YouTube . 4.Please add local files I feature in mobile version of the Spotify. Please make the updates ASAP"
"A fantastic library of great music, podcasts, and lectures. Easy to use and very intuitive."
"Great podcast app. For major content creators, this is the ONLY major podcast service to join under contract. The others are very strict in their guidelines and cram way more ads onto your listeners with non-premium accounts (and the one with the orange letters in their logo spams join premium like 5 times a day!) Paired with Podbean for live streams of indie content; it covers all I need."
I've had no problems with Spotify and I've been a daily user for over 6 years now there's a lot of quite unknown and small bands and artists on there it's just a matter of searching for them.The quality is most of the time is excellent but it's very uploader dependent now I have to admit I do not listen to podcasts so this is just a review of the music.
"100 percent recommended over gaana,apple music,or any other music streaming app,nice and clean ui and easy to use..using it on mobile,tv,laptop. loving it...many people say that there are too many ads but I never felt that.hope it will be same in future as my old music streaming app gaana has changed and I didn't liked it...so I deleted it.but I liked Spotify too much and now I am a primium member and I used it 1 year before buying premium so definitely try it...."
"It is a great app but what I think would make it even better is that, you could have a button to change the your music. Like you could make the song slower or faster because slowed songs give of a different vibe to some people and others they may want to faster to get the same vibe."
"Ive been using spotify for a few years now and never once have i had a problem with it. Music choice is great, UI is great overall amazing app"
"Had a few issues with the app, but I reached out to their amazing customer service, and they fixed it quickly üòä Love spotify! I live in a rural area with limited reception, so the download option is my savior for long drives!"
"My husband & daughter begged me for about 6 months to switch from 10 years of being on Pandora family plan to Spotify & since I had a card expire I decided to not renew it and joined Spotify. Although I LOATHE having to rebuild my music tastes after 10 years of doing it, Spotify is much better at detected my true music likes. So far so good."
Well being an audiophile i can nitpick a couple of things but those are irrelevant to a general person listening to their favorite music. This is a very well curated and managed service and has quite a respectable audio quality after the lossy compression. But if u dont get the premium its may be a pain in the a**.
"I started using the free version of this app in 2016 back when I worked as an ECE. I very quickly fell in love and have been subscribed to the paid version since. Tons of music at my finger tips, and it's even better now that Spotify is available with fit bit and the amazon alexa."
Spotify is one of the most quickest and easiest way to access all the music you could ever want the playlist and options for downloading are amazing
Few songs aren't in the library. Have been a paid member for like a year but still never got the updated UI which actually looks and feels much smoother. Edit: Unavailability of some songs was fixed. Indie artists are also available now which is great.
"A bit expensive rate for premium, but the recommendation from the autoplay radio is worth the price. There used to be an age verification failure for songs played from albums but the devs quickly fixed it."
Perfectly crafted algorithm that suggests the best music that suits my favourite genre. Have been using it for more than a year and still inspires me...
"Absolutely amazing. Unparalleled user experience (UI/UX). The best feature is the radio, where u get similar songs after u listen to a song on search. There's also a SpotAlike feature, that I use on the browser. And oh my god it's just so wonderful. Best music player EVER!! ‚ù§‚ù§ You will especially find it endearing and fantastic with the sheer volume of international language songs that are available. I have used literally all saavn,wynk,googleplaymusic,hungama, gaana, nothing is so satisfying."
"I actually wished they're was a button where if we forgot our password we could end up changing it after tries in trying all over again. Like forgot your password and stuff like that. Not how it is as well because it takes forever to load for the thing that it helps you log in but it dosen't even let me. It says the code expires in 4hrs but it had expired in a few minutes. It irritates me, I had songs I loved and now I can't even get back in. Honestly it's my fault for forgetting the password."
"Been on spoify going on 6 years, this the only thing I've ever been committed to buying each month, even have stocks in spotify. I love it best music app ever. Updates are fine not a super fan of the UI but still love it"
The thing I Love about Spotify is it's App Design and features like it recommends songs that user wants to listen to I Love the app it's Fantastic amazing They have Premium plans for every type of people like the monthly and weekly They also Have Partnered with Discord inc (Rich presence feature ) Spotify is just Amazing I don't ever felt switching from Spotify it's Amazing Awesome just the Best Music streaming Service
"What a very revolutionary app it easy to use ,and it packs quite a lot for every individual, download it quietly you will enjoy ,,THAT SOME GOOD MUSIC HEY....the app doesn't mislead it musics"
"Long time listener. I like rather minimalistic design of the app, flexible payment options and... algorithms! Thanks to Spotify I've discovered so many great artist!"
"Most of the complaints I've read in the comments are by people who aren't paying for premium. Just get premium. It's like 7$ to 10$ or whatever. It solves most of the problems listed by people leaving 3 stars or less. The only major issue I've had with this app was I guess at one point during an update, it caused the app to be very laggy and it wouldnt connect/load until I'm half way to work [I work 14 minutes from home]. But after a quick Uninstall and reinstall, it's back to normal."
Nowhere can you find music to suit and match your taste and preference and Spotify is already one step ahead planning much more songs for me. Love Spotify and Spotify forever.
"Very convenient, very dependable, a wide select on everything . Far out awesome to use. Zero buffering ...no internet required. Like all the rest, of the weak app's out there."
Quite literally the best music app. But the adds are becoming more and more frequent each day and that is quite irritating. Please try to give the best experience to the non paying users of spotify too.
Great app. Hit my musical taste very quickly matching my play list to my likes. Commercial breaks are a small price to pay for the use.
"G'day Folks,I really enjoy Spotify & its suggested similar tunes to my likes! I buy tracks I like from iTunes and put them on my laptop,which then end up on my Classic iPod. So,I am supporting the artists! I cruise on my yacht and am out of range for 6 months of the year at a time with no phone reception,hence, my system of aquiring music on my I Pod. It also means that if I subscribed to Spotify I would not get nearly enough of the day to day usage to justify an annual subscription. Tx,D."
"Started using the ap for the 1st time a couple of weeks ago & since rarely listen to what were my favourite radio stations. The playlists, I guess were initially built around the 3 artists selected when 1st opening the ap contain some really original, cool & previously unheard of tracks. I'm a vinyl man but love the simplicity of negotiating the site using the phone."
"I am loving this platform of spotify..The theme , design etc,. Everything is perfect.. But only some of the songs does not have lyrics ....but overall i love spotify... We are here to support you spotify... Keep going on and bring some special changes in spotify.. Thank you...üòáüòä"
"Been my fave for years, spotify premium is an essential in my life. I love the spotify session feature BUT there are a lot of glitches. Thankfully my friends and I have the patience to work thru them usually but it is quite frustrating"
"So first of all the UI of spotify is just great. Smartphone, as well as the PC app have a great design and are very intuitive. I have every song I want and the music quality of Spotify is the best of all music streaming services. I listen to spotify on the highest quality with high quality headphones, because the best sound is very important to me. Spotify can provide that. If you don't want to spend money in the beginning that's fine. I think even the Basic version of Spotify is really great."
"Very good I have fyi I have premium but I think this is excellent. You can get others but none integrates with ps4, pc, Alexa quite as good as spotify (If at all)."
"Spotify is the best music ap there is. They offer such a wide range of music, you can build your own playlists and each year they make a playlist of your most listened to music just for you! I've had spotify since 2016 and its so good I pay for premium every month for even better benefits! Its totally worth it!"
I like the UI most. Similar recommendations as YouTube Music. But Spotify has more audio contents than all other Music apps. Using it since launched in India.
Love the quality of the music on Spotify! Only thing that bothers me at times is how much less intuitive this program is than the lesser sound quality of you-tube.
Such a user friendly app. Also a wide variety of music with individually designed playlists. A wonderful experience!
"So Easy to use! I broke out the old LPS, chose some favs, and built a playlist on Spotify. Saved me countless hours of poor conversions, and Spotifies suggestions helped me grow my library off my playlist!"
"I like the AI recomandation music and descovery weekly, i love it so much. Great app, great music, good optimisation and intuitive interface, thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Spotify is the gold standard for online music streaming services. Top marks for hiw well it integrates across all devices. If there is one area for improvement, it would be th UI. It feels like the most commonly used features are awkward to access."
"Love that I can make playlists of not only music, but podcast episodes too. Love that I can save playlists to my home screen for quick launching when I hop in the car. Love the home screen widget."
"WARNING: AMAZING APP ADDICTION! The first time is free. So i downloaded spotify and became addicted very quickly the access to my favorite music is really unparralleled.After seven days the free trial expires and i personally experianced immediate panic because i had no way to upgrade to premium but it only took 45 minuts to hit the pawn shop and get a spotify 3 month card. So my warning is really make sure to be able prepaired for when your trial runs out, you are going to need premium! 5 star"
"My favorite music app. All the artists I love are here. The Playlist building capabilities are great and with the family plan, everyone in our hose can have their own account for a low monthly fee. Plus it works well with Android Auto in my car."
Fantastic !! I have access to all my favorite podcasts. Also I use it almost all day at work in a steel building and have never had a single cutout or buffering issues
Best music app I have ever used. Good quality music and I think it will not disappoint any of it's user. Love using this app. But please reduce the frequency of adds. Nice and simple ui.
Quick and easy access to music. Not the depth of a home sound system but satisfactory whilst on the go.
"Spotify is the Best app ever! I use this app alot and Ive never had any issues with it. I've created several playlists, and Spotify has created several playlists, designed especially for me, with hundreds of songs that I ‚ô•Ô∏è, all for free! Thank you Spotify! I recommend you check it out, You cant go wrong with this app!"
"Music moves me, spotify aids me greatly in finding just the song I need to hear when i want to hear it. Pretty slick and intuitive interface, vurr nice"
"The app is really intuitive, the music selection is unparalleled. The Premium subscription is very worth it. The best app to get your music."
"Been a user for years and have one request. If I want to stop listening on a device please put a ""Disconnect from Device"" option instead of a ""Forget Device"" option that is large and requires no secondary ""are you sure?"" Prompt. Thank you"
"Only major gripe is that in the free version, when there is the ""watch an ad to get 30 minutes of ad-free listening"" there is 10 unskippable seconds of ""enjoy your ad-free experience talk."" I bet if that was replaced with an equal amount of ad time, you'd get more money without sacrificing any user experience. They wouldn't get any more ad time, yet you'd get more ad time! Missed opportunity"
Best music app available. Fantastic artists and the UI is super easy and efficient to navigate! 5 stars well deserved keep making it better üëç
"The app is great, sound quality is awesome and the experience is quite lean. One thing I don't understand is why can't I access the songs in my playlist offline. I have downloaded them over and over, but they keep getting erased. I don't understand how that works."
This app never let's you down with all it's new music and always trying to give you the best experience whether its checking up on you to see if you are enjoying the app or finding better deals for you or even upgrading you package to suit you. Spotify always has new music specifically designed for you taste in music and your favourite genre!!
Such a huge collection of songs we can find for every kind of mood and situations. And great plans which convinient for all types of requirements. Great experience. üòÄüëçü§òüòÑ
Great collection of songs. Intuitive user interface and excellent sound quality.. absolutely the best music app out there!!
Spotify is simply the best!! Love their intuitive and personal customised playlists that seem to perfectly capture your taste in music and cater to your mood. I've been introduced to so many incredible musicians and artists and enjoyed music I had never heard of before. Thank you for bring music to my soul Spotify!! .. You make my day and will always have a special 'spot' in my heart ‚ô• üé∂
"Love it ,you can design your own Playlist. And they will suggest/make you a weekly Playlist based on things you've listened to. And being able to listen while scrolling facebook or kohls/walmarts app is pretty cool !!"
Great app for people who love listening to music however the equalizer is a little complicated as i have an up to date smart phone. I enjoy this app a lot and could have an easier equalizer and could possibly have a built in shazam. Other than that this app is great for people who are passionate about what they listen to. I would also recomend this to artists want to be artists.
Very good app to listen to songs. The songs load up very quickly and run without buffering. One of the best apps out there.
"I use it all the time. And share the account on my PC as well. The song recommendations are quite good, and I love the pre made daily mix."
"Great sound Quality and vast range of songs. The support is very useful and quick to respond. Easy to use because the layout is simple and effective. Use on or offline. Many relaxing songs, podcasts, disco, etc."
...Spot on Spotify. ...I have not felt such music-love since the days of mixed tapes or ..more recently creating compilation cd's on my iMac while studying Graphic Design in 2000. I feel connected to the music world and the people I love & share Spotify with get the same feeling of control & ease.. I won't lose my mind if I have my fave tunes at hand. App Happy! Tune-escenct! Thankyou Spotifyland üëå
Very intuitive and user friendly. Also a truly vast and varied selection of music and podcasts etc. Highly recommended
"Just awesome. It is suitable for Indian who is in the yearning of listening korean music, BTS and Indian music on a single platform while writing, working and multitasking. It's podcasts are worth listening. Better than other music platforms."
"I listen to music every day with spotify, the streaming quility is great and the app is very easy to learn, spotify always suggests great songs to add to my playlists, absolutely worth the monthly subscription üëç"
There is nothing better for music than spotify. You can find anything on the planet on it and it is a great app to use so easy and so quick and so simple. This is been my favorite music app for the all of existence
"Best app for music lovers ...i have tried many apps but i liked it most..very smooth , easy to use and feature loaded ... all songs are available in spotify. But those who are not music lover ..i recommend them not to download spotify ..because it is just made for music lovers ...i am a guitarist and i have tried many apps for music but i didn't found any app usefull but ..using spotify is a different and amazing experience for me .....hope this will help you"
"The best music app I have ever gotü§© But I don't have premium in my account so it provides many ads which are just irritating. But no worries, others features are quite goodüòÉ!! Thank you Spotify for making each day of mineüíöüñ§"
Used spotify the most of all the choices .layout works for me. And the gui fits me. Hoe the buttons for functions just are in the right place for no extra effort or errors when working out
"I try almost all available music app like Apple music, wynx, gaana, jio music, savan, amazon music but I was not able to stick to anyone for long time and there was multiple reason like songs vairety, quality, auto Playlist, UI experience for one or other I was not use the app properly. For Spotify I was reluctant to use at first as I thought it won't be having good variety of hindi songs but to surprise it was really good. One best feature what I like the Playlist suggestion. Really happy."
"Great music and (recently discovered) Podcast service@!! With or without Premium, I get great and frequent use from this app. It does often require a restart however I still have no complaints!"
"Great music app, good choice of music and good that it has car play in settings making the play, pause, and buttons bigger when u are in your car, it seemed to dissappear for a while on the app but I have it back now which is great. Overall a brilliant app, just maybe wish u could maybe change the style and layout of your playlists more, I. E. Bigger and choices of different layout how they look etc. Something maybe for the developers to think about. But totally love this music app. üëç"
"I truly LOVE my Spotify premium account. I have no problem affording the expense to have MY music all the time offline. My only suggestion would be to add more volume control, I like my music loud. When I use Spotify in comparison to YouTube it's noticeably quieter. Otherwise I have no issues with the app!"
I have found this music app the best than any other apps... UI is so user friendly and music quality is really so awesome... You can add this app in your phone to get the melodious taste of music...
"Probably One of the Best Music Streaming Services I have ever used. It's been the daily driver for each and every person that i recommended it to. One the Many Nice things about this is That the pre-built playlists are GOOD. You will actually want to listen to them. And also the dark theme. I am just kind of obsessed with it. Also, the playlists made to help in focus and to study is also very good and has lately helped me build my productivity. Overall, you know that there is no compromises."
I have updated my review. Since a month ago I can see an improvement from the App and I dont face more issues. So quite happy with the new app updates. Old review October 2020 I have a lot of issues with the App. I cannot even log in. Everytime I request for a new password it sends me a link which it is already old. So I can not reset it. It says also is offline. I can not enjoy it since few weeks ago. Dont know how to solve it.
Pros 1. Best UI. 2. Lots of content. 3. Best algorithm ( sort of like a mind reader ). Cons 1. Nothing. Note : Go with premium. Ads will really gets on your nerves. üôÇ
"I use spotify all the time. I'm in love with the karaoke option. I used to play songs and quickly search the lyrics in internet, but now the lyrics are always there. The app never crash or something like that. And the pc version is good and looks aesthetic."
Solid platform. Better than Soundcloud when it comes to actual music that people want to listen. The ads are not a nuisance at all for me. Well done!
"Brilliant app, so quick,easy, simple to use and sooooo many songs, artists, album's and information to help you find the relevant artists/songs."
I love it! It's easy to use and find new and old favorites. The premade playlists also featured are very nice. I recommend upgrading to the premium as the unlimited skips and back button are locked with the free version.
We upgraded to the family plan and have fallen in love with spotify all over again. We all can share our playlists or keep it seperate. Endless hours of music and it doesnt kill my phone as quickly at youtube.
Amazing app...works well and uder friendly UI. I used to use it on my daily basis and I had a bug which was causing the app to close automatically.. Thanks to the Spotify Team for helping me in over coming the issue. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Great App with Great Developer Support‚ù§Ô∏è Spotify Deserves 5 Star rating!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
"I hate doing playlists. I love random and did not find a way to shuffle a whole artist, only songs inside an album. However, daily mixes and other proposed stuff, based on what I usually listen to, work great. I would give Spotify zero stars for not having Accent - FluierƒÉturi in bisericƒÉ, but I am minding my suffering... somehow. Music should surprise you, not serve you like chocolate after being dumped by a lover. Also music is math only the soul can solve, but it is math. It is therefore holy"
awesome music app. it would be spectacular if Spotify links with poweramp music player. An option though apart from the device built in player.
"Excellent , no words can be used to describe the app , only one thing, please don't change the minimalistic black UI, I might be biased, & am a Spotify fanboy..."
Quite amazing. They always suggest good songs based on your previous listening. They wrap your year or summer in a playlist. I love it. Totally recommend it.
"Want to be on the cutting edge of the newest music trends like you used to? I was decades behind, bored and can't really stand most big label ""produced"" top 40 radio drivel. Loving music once again and hearing the good stuff first. Quick learner, knows what your into. Has turned me on to SO much brand spanking new stuff. Turns out my tastes have changed as well, who knew? THE BEST NEW MUSIC APP SO FAR."
"A great range of music styles and genres. I always find something to suit my mood and ""daily mixes"" with recommendations from your listening experiences it's hard not to enjoy Spotify!"
"Best user experience. Looking to see the music collection library grow, so that search feature is more smart and accurate."
Love it especially the UI and recommendations since it has a better algorithm than its other competitors and believe me I have tried it all only one other streaming comes close YT music but it doesn't have Spotify original podcasts.
The best! But... why the GIANT 'Shuffle Play' button on the playlist screen? How about a smaller 'Shuffle' button and an adjacent 'Play button' so you can play upon opening a playlist without scrolling down?
"Amazing !! I came across every music platform but nothing impressed me that much as spotify did. The clean, vibrant and minimal UI, auto generated playlists and genre classifications made me never quit the app. I was a free user and the ads were disturbing me diverting my attention to a playlist but now I'm a premium member and can easily play anything I want and download songs and podcasts."
I love Spotify! No other music stream lets you play what you want when yoy want -- no matter how obscure. For example a recent Louis Vitton commercial sampled a slow version of a disco song I loved as a teen. But since radio never played I totally forgot. After a few google searches rediscovered Idris Muhammed's Could Heaven Ever Be Like This! Incredible! Thank you Spotify. It's now included in my Disco and Dance playlist.
"Well, I thought Spotify is the best, but it's not. I thought so because of all that hype around it. Yes, it has a large database of high-quality music, but so Youtube Music does. The app has a cool UI and UX but music and covers loads too slowly and sometimes there are wrong covers. In comparison to Spotify app, YT Music loads music and covers really fast and there are never wrong covers. Both Spotify and YT Music have Premium plans for students but it's harder to get one in Spotify."
App is designed beautifully. Content is good. Playlists are awesome. Sound quality is awesome. Only content of old Bollywood songs is less. So need improvement for this topic. Overall nice experience.
"Old update is 5 stars. New update is 2 stars. Navigation in app is extremely hard and the UI is extremely slow, takes 3 seconds to load a song off the albums. Please revert back to old Spotify!!"
Best music streaming platform out here. Non of these lil girlies are doing it like Spotify. The playlists? Immaculate. The end of year Wrapped? *chef's kiss*. The song and artist recommendations that perfectly suit your taste? Exemplary. The podcasts??? TRAILBLAZING. Name a b*tch badder than Spotify. That's right YOU CAN'T!!! Tell apple music and all them lil kids to pack it up! Quickly.
Great app! Great choices and the app is quickly learning my preferences. Just switched to premium - so nice with no adds and a few more features.
It's the most appropriate music app for music lovers. The playlists are better than other apps and the recommendations are quite good. The most interesting feature of this app is the Wrapped feature. Here you can discover your yearly music activities and it's fun.
"Better than Pandora!!!! Only thing i cant stand is your greed for advertising. I loyaly paid for premium for years and the moment i dont you slam a person with advertisment after advertisement and waste my time with pressing a button for a lousey 30 minutes of music. Get rid of the ""Watch Now"" button cause your going to make me listen to your advertising anyway. Time is the most valuble thing on Earth so quit wasting mine. Wheres your loyalty?"
"Our family just switched from YouTube music. This entire experience is so much better plus we can stream direct to our sonos now. Spotify is also way more intuitive with lists and suggestions! We transfered all of our Playlist for free with less than 1% inaccuracies, which are easy to remedy after the fact."
"They need to fix their Ui. Saving / Removing a song to your list is too near to the play button. Shuffling is a huge mess. When you do it songs that you previously listened to is on repeat. Feels like my thousand plus song library is only hundred less. Also the app freezes a lot. Sheesh. I do still give it a 5/5 but come on guys. I like your service, but can you atleast listen to people who pays for premium?"
"Thanks for great app! Using premium every day for last years! Greatest feature is the weekly songs suggestions! Only improvements I would like to see is the separation of music section from podcasts (podcasts deserve their own section, so it doesn't ruin the music experience and also improves the latter, and an improved podcast discovery/searching UX), and removing some playlist suggestions/past played playlists (eg. country based suggestions, which are very irrelevant for me most of times)."
"Great app, love the variety and the recommendations, extremely intuitive and easy to use. Also love the suggested new artists and Daily Mixes and Release Radar!"
I should have been using Spotify all these years instead of Google Music. Great work! Intuitive Huge song selection The forward cache isn't bad either. Dolby options This positive list goes on.....
"It's an amazing app! Sometimes it glitches out, but that's fine. And something funny that happens is; when I'm watching stuff on crunchyroll, and i press the play button on my earbuds, it plays spotify. Even if spotify isn't open, but I'm fine with it happening lol"
Love it! Has access to every artist I could think of and has actually introduces me to artists that joined the ranks as some of my favorites. It's very intuitive and I've never had a problem with the interface. I spend at least a few hours a day listening to it and am not ashamed to admit I'd be completely lost without it :)
"Don't know why, but i hate to use online music app before I use spotify . means i have no word to express how much I love this app . UI of the Spotify is very attractive and i like it so so much . Overall 9.9 out of 10 ‚úîÔ∏è"
in my times I've almost lost all hope temper dignity and mind more than I can count in numbers thank you for this app it's saved me too many times to count for some reason since the first time I ever opened it I just loved the fact I could pick the genre based off my mood. lifesaver to the fullest thank you genuinely seriously and for real thank you from a person disassociated from even myself. This is/was/will be my own saving grace.
"I really liked the way, the designers have designed the app. Playing songs on this app was really a great feeling. I have used other apps for listening to songs which includes Gaana, Hungama Music, Airtel Wynk. Still I would say that this the best music listening app I have seen so far. Thank you makerss. The only thing I want improved is that you must add a section where I could play the songs which are in the phone memory, even if I am offline. Else, I loved it."
Hands down the best music streaming service. 10/10 both in Quantity and Quality. No other streaming services match Spotify in terms of audio quality and library. Literally no competition for Spotify! Sleek and modern UI; Music discovery is pretty much tailored to my tastes now; absolutely love it! ‚ù§ The student plans and prepaid plans are a bonus. Also love that there's Paytm as a payment option. üëçüèº
"I am rating this as premium because that's how it's meant to be used, if you get the free version don't be surprised if it's not that great, but the family plan for premium is very cheap and as a music app is completely perfect, works well and very intuitive with all the features id want"
"Brilliant app, I've made different play lists to suit what I want to listen to, I've even made a mixed Christmas list mix with normal music and then out of all my lists I have favourites so I can play my favourites that are mixed from different styles of music. Only downside are the adds."
"I used to use a device that solely relied on hard disk space as I was always weary about streaming services. Since using Spotify I've found that whilst I can build as many playlists as I like, I can also discover new music. I'd still be listening to the same things if it wasn't for Spotify so thank you!"
"Was good originally. Last few months have been awful with glitches. Not playing songs no matter what you do, skipping songs randomly without hitting buttons. Sometimes when you want to change songs it won't. Samsung s9."
"Widget removed. Why? To change song, review playlist is one click too many. Edit: widget back!!! Quite often player stops playing songs even in offline mode when I have them on my device"
I have found in Spotify every artist I like and the daily mixes created by Spotify are an excellent way to have a quick selection of my favorite music. Very intuitive user interface.
"Great app, really good design, and I listen to songs everyday. I wish that some premium features were free. There is a really cool free feature where you get lyrics and background information on the artist and song."
"Spotify is one of the best music app, i like their community! each year, they wrapped a story-based like of what you're listening, its like your statistics based on what you're listening, they showed you what you've done so far, and it suprises me! not every app has a genius 'thing' like that. Spotify is so easy to use, but if you're accidentally unchecked the download button, it will reset all downloaded song and you must re-download it and it negatively impat the app's, overall its amazing"
"This is the best you can get from a Music streaming application. With thousands of podcasts and latest music albums [along with retro classics ;)]. The UX/UI is so neat and easy to comprehend! On top of it the features, premium provides you with, totally worth itüíô Would recommend this application over other streaming applications like Amazon Music, Google Music, YT music and Apple Music (Not a user but got feedback from my friends) üíô"
"The most used and most vital app on my phone. A brilliant user experience, an incredible array of music choices and couldn't live without it!!"
Best music app I've ever had(and I've had plenty). The many Playlist have helped me discover so many new artist and UI is super clean. Highly recommend.
"This is literally the best audio streaming platform available here in India. My only concern is the ads, sometimes there are 5 back to back ads which becomes annoying, 1 to 2 ad is ok but 5 is a bit too much. Other than that, this is hand's down one of my favourite apps of all time. Kudos to the developers for creating such a refined and polished experience. P.S. - The frequency of ads have increased like crazy, ruins the whole experience."
"Superb - genuinely impressive system across multiple platforms, all the music I love whenever I want it, and a bargain for the family plan... can't recommend it enough"
BEST UI. Its really easy to explore new songs! Would be great if I could swipe a song to add it to the queue.
I was a long time sound cloud user and i still use it for some remixes i found on yt. But the sound quality has always been better on spotify. And the ui overall is so convenient.
Great app listen to music all day and night at work makes the time at work go by quickly .I like that u can make playlists to play without wifi never with music rock out with your------- out.
Lots of bugs as of late. Song stops playing on its own. Pause button has no effect. The song it shows is not the song that it is playing. First time having issues with spotify after several years so I'm backing it will get fixed. Update: fixed
"Spotify is the best! I got addicted to it via a friend because she showed me how you can build playlists and make them, it's fantastic‚ô°! I also realized Spotify gives you weekly mixtapes which has a ton of songs on it that will most likely will be to your taste according to what you've already added. They even have daily recommends so you're never bored and will never run out of music to listen to. Thanks Spotify! The Membership is well worth it!"
"I honestly do love Spotify. The worst thing on the mobile version is that there's no on demand playing unlike the Desktop version. I do pay for premium, but seeing one of my friends Spotify, playing a game of luck with the shuffle button to see if they can play their song in the playlist. Besides that (Which you really should fix as Spotify is Spotify weather it's on Desktop or Mobile) Spotify is better than any other paid/free music app."
So much content and user experience. Very good platform for music and podcasts. I have the premium account so I don't know how the free version is.
"Was looking to make my own Playlist using only positive upbeat Christian songs, I could not how quickly ""Spotify"" grouped a selection for me! No matter what you enjoy listening to, you have to give this app a try!"
"I absolutely love Spotify. I still use the free version, but this app has helped me find my taste in music. Before I used Spotify, I used to listen to overhyped pop songs that I didn't quite enjoy. I started finding songs that I liked more, and the recommendations that this app provides are absolutely amazing! I've been using Spotify for two years now. Music is a huge part of my life and this app has helped me discover underrated songs that I never would have found otherwise."
Awesome songs collection... Perfect.. app.. no complaints... Just one request if you guys can add a Heart or like button on Device lock screen... It will be very helpful to like the songs and save them... Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"I enjoy the seamless playing of any music I'd like to hear. I have the x2 plan very worth it. I can listen to all my Christian music I want, the selection is very big. The search engine is very intuitive and is most times spot. although some times you think you're playing three shuffle mode is a little unbiased. It will play the same songs from a genre and not switch out, this I find frustrating. All in all I have and will enjoy using this app for years to come."
"really great, enjoy learning new music and revisiting some great songs from the past. wish I could hit a button to organize my music by genre though;) thanks"
"I actually really love Spotify, I love building my own playlists and be able to listen to it wherever I go. It's easy to use and always reliable."
"I love spotify! The experience is very personal, easy to use, and efficient! Not to mention the music catalog available to users is quite inclusive. Spotify is by far my fave streaming app for jamming to my fave tunes and discovering awesome new tracks."
"Great for music, lmao, it's got a good UI. The recommendations are often to my tastes, and it's got a wide selection of the stuff I like. Overall great app for music."
I've used Spotify for over 5 years and I love so so very much! I've never had a problem with it. It's always quick and reccoemnds great music! Such a huge library.
"It is a great app for music streaming. I am really impressed with the music collection they have developed over the period of time. However, there are still few albums/songs that I can't find it over here. But performance wise, this app is quite stable and smooth."
"Since I've downloaded Spotify, every other music app pales in comparison. Easy navigation, easy searching and saving, pleasant UI.. plus with the family account my daughter has access to all her favorite hits. Happy to spend the $15 a month for premium features."
The perfect app for music streaming. Literally. The audio quality is amazing period. And you can control the audio quality too. Love the simplistic design and layout.
Love the app. It's design is asthetically pleasing to me and the radio function to find new songs is really helpful. Definitely worth the price to me.
"I've been using Spotify for quite some time now, both free and premium, in laptop, smartphone and Alexa and I can say without a doubt the best music streaming app. Now the free version also works in Alexa, which is amazing. What I like best compared to other apps offering the same is the algorithm that suggests you new songs based on what you are listening to, it's the best out there. I'd just suggest to put lyrics to songs,would make it abs the perfect music app"
"This is what a music app should be!! After using several other music apps for years before the death of my fave forced me to migrate, I wish I started using Spotify sooner... Smooth UI, no random freezing/glitches, syncs properly across devices, and the easiest casting experience! On top of simply being an incredibly polished app, it has plenty of features I haven't tried yet. Best value for a premium music streaming subscription."
The best music app i have ever seen. The ads are annoying but they are not often as in Gaana or Wynk. I like using Spotify . After downloading it I almost forgot that i also have an inbuilt music player which i don't use from past 1 year. The spotify is an app which should be installed on every music lovers' app beacause that person will surely love it more than any other app. I wish I could share my experience but it is not possible as I have already reached word limit . Thankyou Team Spotify..
The best thing I like about this app is that without paying also you can listen offline if once you listened online. The only thing it requires is a little internet connection to play earlier songs once listened online to play offline.
"Works perfect with Google home speakers and Assistant. Intuitive interface. After several months of using Spotify, I find it much better than either Apple music or Google Music, both of which I used for several years. Spotify Works seamlessly with my Mac and Chromebook computers and with my Android phone."
"First time user and it's been easy to use, very intuitive to my choices, and I'm getting new content I might not of ever got a chance to hear. There's some adds, but not a lot and I don't find them that intrusive. Great üëç app **2 year Review**- Spotify continues to do all that it did two yeas ago plus it now tracks podcasts for me and has original content I wasn't aware of before. I've tried some other services along the way and Spotify is the only one I will pay to use. Don't screw it up."
Really great app with a huge variety of music. I have a premium plan where my entire family of 6 gets premium for only $10 or $15 or something ridiculously low like that. A few days ago I got locked out of my account and couldnt change my password and the customer support team was very friendly and resolved the problem very quickly.
One of the best apps out there hands down. The most intuitive to use for streaming music. It's compatible with almost any modern device I use anywhere.
A great app. Huge selection of music and an excellent user experience. Really needs to offer lossless quality though.
I'm yet to use the paid membership but the free membership is also too good. The music suggestions are perfect for my choice and I'm really enjoying this app. The podcasts are quite good too.
"One of the best android apps I've ever used, and not just in the music category. The user interface is something all app developers can learn a thing or two from. So easy to use and incredibly intuitive."
Updating my 1 star review It's the best music streaming service I've ever had so far. My issues before were caused by faulty hardware on my old phone I guess. Only critics I've got is the download switch in playlists... There should be a modal confirming my choice when switching it off bcz it's no fun downloading 12gb of music bcz of a missclick... Didn't happen in a while tho bcz I learned to wait till the UI finishes loading. Oh and maybe turning off the stories behind lyrics. I only want lyr.
Amazing! Very intuitive. Loads of different playlists and functionalities. Sooooo worth the money! I would definitely recommend over the other music apps.
I ahve been using Spotify for quite some time nowü§©... I am thrilled with the song recommendations and customized play lists it givesüíØüíØüíØ... I'm loving it üòçüòçüòç... Just a request to Spotify team to reduce the ads littleüòã
"This app is insanely amazing this app had a few issues when I first downloaded but now it's ""AWSOME"" and ""AMAZING"" I recommend all fans of music to download this app it's just amazing even words can't tell how amazing is it if you want to download an music app then what are you waiting for just click that ""Install"" button"
"I love this app. It's compatible with almost all devices, and doesn't require paying the Premium for a great experience. I haven't found a way to get my songs to play offline, but I'm sure that there's a way. Has all types of music ready to suit any of my moods!"
"Bitchin' music service. However, Spotify is a tad light on classical music performed by the Chicago Symphony , which typically is the strongest. However, a notable exception is the Philadelphia Symphony's Pastorale; very unusual and yet utterly beguiling. Maybe not just how Beethoven might have wanted it, but who knows? And he's long gone, so tough noogies Ludwig. Enjoy spotify every day, we do. F'real."
"Dude this is the best music streaming platform. Not only because it has all the good stuff and simple UI but for me , its autoplays , it has the best choice of songs to play on autoplay."
"Absolutely addicted to it, though it contains adds but they are perfectly timed unlike other apps especially gaana. The best thing is, you can find Playlists suiting your mood."
The collection is good. UI is good. Would like to have more music from japanese and korean artists. Also I feel the sound quality is lacking compared to korean music streaming apps like bugs.
Great app and very useful when it comes to music. You can find whatever you want and it's very intuitive üòç I really appreciate it unlike youtube cause music sounds more qualitative and I don't have stupid adds.
"Great song suggestions. Suits every mood. Work, study, chill, travel, party, classics, genre-specific. Loving the experience. Spotify has become my primary music streaming app now !"
"I honestly do love this app (I'm a premium user so i do have a bias) the user interface is nice and clean and very nice to look at,all options for playlists.The spotify made playlists and discover weekly are great ways of finding new artists.The only problem is that it's missing quite a few albums and sometimes they only have the deluxe version of albums."
Well i chose a hell lot of bands in the beginning. And the app outputted quite nice playlists. Works good so far(10minutes). I know that my opinion is very important.
Was on Google play music but so far Spotify is far better. Not as intuitive as I'd hope but I'm just getting started. I definitely recommend this app.
"For an app that has most music in the world, its well rounded. Sure, there are ads, but if you want them to dissappear then get premium. I get a 6 month free trial when I got my phone, and that is amazing. I can listen to what ever music I want and enjoy with out ads and I get the pick the song I want. Its cool and a fun app. Though I do wish they would stop having 4 ads per 5 songs, its quite annoying. Maybe set it to 2 or even 1 ads. But none the less, thank you spotify."
"One of the best apps out there, the sound quality and UI faar surpasses competitors. Totally worth getting the premium subscription. A must for audiophiles!"
"Pretty awesome set up, I didn't want to switch because I didn't want to have to redo my playlist all over again, but Spotify is very intuitive & easy to use."
Well quite frankly I'm using this And this really helped me out No matter what I feel there's a deep sadness and sometimes I really feel disappointed. This app just resets everything and make me forget my problems. I like it so much it's a part of my daily living and hope this app remains the same for me and the people out there who feel the same like me...üôÇüôÇüòá
"Honestly underrated.. having quick access to pretty much every song thinkable, the only thing that can make it better is lower price, but Apple is to blame for that. 9.5/10 (if they keep the UI layout as it is)"
Only if I can do other things and let the music play in the background. With music there should always be a repeat button. I'm Wes and im very amazing. If I vote and lay my opinion then its official. This is day 1 of me trying this app if I see any kinks I'll state it. Keep it good Spotify and yall can rely on me to keep this app on top of its category
"I decided to try Spotify when I heard that Joe Rogan was going to be exclusively on Spotify after December. Pleasantly, I discovered this Spotify is really a good app. It's easy to use, very intuitive, doesn't ask for too many permissions, and it's very user friendly. I have other apps that handles my media, but Spotify is now my primary go to. Thanks to the developers. The app does exactly what I wanted to right now, please don't cripple it with updates! Thanks."
"Its very cool, you dont have commercials and it varies in the type of muisc. Mine is mostly Rock and Spotify got me into bands. That I've never heard of. Highly Recommend it"
"Just love it! Moved from apple music, way more options for customisation and personalisation,and with time it becomes also more intuitive and comfortable."
"Best music service there is. The app design is beautiful and easy to use. The algorithm learns fast and adjusts to your tastes. I love the Discover Weekly Playlist feature. There's even a timer to stop the music if you fall asleep. It's obvious that it's made from people who ""get"" music."
"Best music platform, ever. Best thing about it, for me? Is the audio quality. I swear the EQ is like Built In to the app because when I'm listening to my music, it Always Sounds so much better!! Second best thing, would be the music. Love Love Love the 'Release Radar' and 'Discover Weekly', as well as my 'Daily Mixes'. I just love how they're all personalized JUST 4 ME!! Oh, and the $9.99 Premium membership is Totally Worth It, for more reasons than I have space to write haha. Thanks, Spotify!"
"Haven't got any major issues. Used Spotify for years now, always paid for premium and I have no complaints. Great sound, it's quite user friendly, great song recommendations.... however every now and again the app breaks and I can't access settings and I have to reinstall the app and re download everything. Other than that, it's been my favourite music streaming app."
"Contains so many ads man out of a 10 minute app use it gives me an ad of 1 minute and the audio quality is also not that good. But,i have the premium version which gives me very good audio quality with no ads and also a great user experience spotify premium is worth it, if you listen to music a lot you should buy it."
I had an amazing experience with spotify . I really look forward to play music on it . It also has a lot of songs which I couldn't fing on other music apps. So I am quite pleased with It . And I really reccomend it for listening to your favourite songs!!!!
"My student subscription has literally saved my life, especially as a single mother of 3! If they added optional lyrics like a few other platforms have, I'd be everyone's next, and possibly only, favorite spokeswoman for Spotify! (I would do it now without hesitationüòÇ My genuine admiration and appreciation.. It'd certainly be UNMATCHED!) I mean, really. Are you even LIVING if you don't have Spotify? I'll give you the answer to save you guys time, NO. Check your vitals and thank me later. YWüòè"
"Excellent source of a very broad collection of musiic (good for me, who is 'genre fluid'). I had a few bumpy weeks with features after Android 11 launched, but Spotify fixes have things all working smoothly again. Thanks"
"Very good experience if ur not premium its obviously going to bring adverts, only issue is sometimes you'll have no adverts for ages then suddenly you get upto 8 adverts at once which can be quiet annoying. Just spread them out guys! :D serious note though had very good use from this app always recommends new songs that I like! Old songs also, would recommend. üëå"
Been using it for years for the past couple of months i took premium because the ads where annoying sometimes but after taking premium i loved it overall iam very satisfied with the sound quality and especially the ui is very easy to use ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I love this app!! Jus wish it would quite telling me to tap now for 30 minutes commercial free adds...cuz it's a pain! It I could jus tap my phone that would be great ...but no I have to unlock phone .which isn't safe in car driving...love everything else tho! Great app..tons of great music....love it!
"Algorithm is perfect, so is GUI and the downloading interface. I like to see the continuous improvement that Spotify does; hope to see it become even more profitable:)"
Spotify is and will remain the only music subscription service I pay for. They are the best. Customer service is always top notch too. Every time I have brought up and issue it was solved quickly and to my satisfaction.
"I am a premium subscriber, so the I am eligible for also highly commending the BETA group session feature. And the discover and custom playlists by Spotify are awesome .The UI is better than any other services in India. It is really good for streaming high quality songs. It provides a really good variety of podcasts too ,really recommend it,better than any other provider in India today.Good competitor of Amazon Music in terms of sound quality. :)"
"The absolute best music app in the world!! Their UI is fantastic, a very clean interface, intuitive to navigate. The widest possible range of music and podcasts one could ask for. Their premade daily mixes are really good and segregated by genre depending on your mood. Also provides great suggestions to new music based on your listening history. It is the #1 music streaming app for a reason."
"Was logged out of my account this morning due to an unauthorised email change. Customer support were fantastic and super quick to respond so that I could get access back to my account. Have always loved the app, but this experience was so easy and unstressful, so great job Spotify on your fantastic customer support."
"Love this app, I've been using it for quite some time now, And it works perfectly. They have a bunch of songs, from all the creators that I like, and find, it's honestly just a really good service!"
"I started using Spotify in 2019 and haven't stopped using it since. I especially like the minimalistic aesthetic of the UI... One thing that I'm sure a lot of people would like, is smoother animations(transitions)"
"Overall pretty good service, the music selection is wide. Although something may not work as intended, overall it works pretty well. Would be nicer if we could listen to.muisc from downloads throughtnmultiple files amd could acess local file music on public playlists throughout devices, mobile and pc alike, but iverall fits most of my needs."
"Really great app for streaming music, such a simplistic yet great looking UI. A lot of freedom for customisation and editing of playlists and overall easy to use. Only thing is sometimes randomly deletes downloaded songs and/or albums. Can really get in the way if your out and want to listen to some music"
"Such a great app! Simple yet elegant UI and design. Good song quality even for free access. Just a few glitches and bugs from time to time. But, I also hope they'd improve the song suggestions for Daily Mixes and Weekly playlists. Overall, I highly recommend the app!"
"Spotify has been my go-to source og music for over a decade now. I've tried other services too, but never considered cancelling my Spotify. It's user friendly, stable, and the audio quality is quite acceptable. Thank you Spotify, for providing huge amounts of joy all these years."
Had an issue with playback that required a bunch of back and forth with support. Ended up having to restore defaults on my device. Support was very quick to reply and help me get the music back in my life and I'm greatly appreciative.
Very good app. You can listen music freely anywhere. Also does not require a lot of internet. You can also use another app while listening to music. I really love this appüòóüòÄüòÅüòÅ
"The app was amazing, until it logged me out and doesn't let me back in, saying that my internet has the power of a curbstomped refrigirator magnet, even if with a quick glance you could clearly see that it should be working splendiferously. However, the pros outweigh the cons."
"I just loved the quality of Spotify. I have used JioSaavn ,Gaana ,Youtube Music and Spotify , I just loved Spotify for its Superb UI and Music Quality. But I am disappointed at a point which is , Bengali songs are very few on spotify. Please increase your Bengali Songs collection. Thats It."
"I'd been using Amazon Music, but discovered the student pricing for Hulu + Spotify, so now I'm here. I recall not enjoying basic Spotify, but for me, Premium is worth it. Nice, quick sync across devices, excellent offline mode that took me through a 16-hour drive with no issues."
"Always easy to use. They take what you like and listen too and make sure to give you the best mixes and the best what you may like suggestions. I would never go back to Apple and its been a couple of years and am still here liking it more and more. Just imagine really quick, waking up in the morning to your alarm and listening to whatever the radio puts out or set it to Spotify and wake up to your favorite music gradually getting louder and a mix of made by Spotify. Best wake up. Good Morning üòÅ"
"Excellent app. I uninstalled all other music app(s). This app has wide variety and range of collection, and for english song it shows difficult lyrics text to understand the songs, and fantastic UI interface. üëç"
"Personally, It's really great app.! Though I can't find few songs yet it's quite compatible. You can even download the podcasts with a free account."
"Works as it supposed to. It plays music. Without premium it's only able to shuffle one artist, but I have no problem with that, since competition (cough cough dezzer cough cough) adds random song when shuffling artist, whitch annoys me a lot. UI is also pretty good"
"Got the premium version and it works just fine and as intended. Never crashed on me, I got my playlists and the recommendations are pretty spot on, too. Also use it on PS4 while playing and can switch songs with my phone or PC, so that's pretty useful. The price for premium is fair for what it has to offer. Overall I am quite happy with Spotify."
It's a great app. Clean UI and spot-on algorithms which always blow my mind with the song suggestions. Keep up the good work!
"After trying out several different streaming apps, this one is by far the easiest to use. Building playlists is smooth and the sound quality is great."
"Premium is King. There is a line drawn on the ground, an abstract boundary in the time line of Music Experience - before and after Spotify. Spotify almost knows what you feel and enhances that feeling by the right Playlist or song. Beware - it's powerful. Well done developers! You've won votes, and more importantly our hearts. The End! .. One feedback - Wish there was a feedback button for direct feedbacks."
"Using for last 1 year. No other music streaming platform can beat Spotify in terms of UI, Songs Collection, Customised Playlists, Personalised song recommendations and sound quality."
"*EDITED* We have been Spotify Premium users for probably 5 to 7 years now. Definitely love this app and most of its features. Would definitely recommend the premium service to people. We just wish the app had a few more features, ( here they are) 1. Recently Played Song List. 2. New Released Songs Based on your Favorite Genre. ( Brand New Songs) 3. Recommend Songs for you list. ( different from discover weekly, we love that tab but list of original songs.) 4. Play next button."
Spotify experience is exceptional and it has a great collection list which gets updated frequently as per hit lists. Quite comfortable to get connected with smart home systems like Alexa & easily gets connected with car.
"The song selection is incredible, it's format design is incredibly easy to understand and use, even for someone who threatens to kill their phone every 5 Seconds because I touched the side of the screen üòÖ I've had Spotify for a few years now and I've cultivated a pretty nice library and I've really enjoyed it, I've actually been using my sisters however, I definitely plan I'm getting it for myself in the future! It has been something I've appreciated, during Covid-19 especially."
"I enjoy using Spotify, especially since it now has inbuilt functionality with my Ultimate Ears Boom 3. I still use the free version, however the ads do have the whole family up in arms! 3 ads in a row is probably annoying enough to get most people to convert to premium!"
I dont know why others are complaining about the price. There's no such thing as free lunch. Of course Spotify wants you to pay up. The UI is extremely good especially after coming here from Amazon music which is the worst UI I've ever used. The spotify customer service is also great. My problem was resolved promptly after chatting with a representative. Overall an excellent app and I'm enjoying my premium subscription. I'm regularly listening to new music and the recommendations are great.
"Spotify caters to my specific music listening needs very well. I've tried YouTube music, Prime music, Gaana, Saavn, Wynk etc., but I didn't find any of them to be as mature or polished as Spotify. I liked Spotify connect, the ""playlist for every occasion"" idea, downloads and the overall aesthetics. The lyrics UI is super cool. I wish they allowed us to upload songs which are not in their catalogue (like some rare remixes found in YouTube). Still ‚ù§"
I love this app. I have Amazon Music too but Spotify is much quicker on my android devices. It syncs well with Alexa and by bluetooth on my Dansette record player.
"Guys, love the app. Just a bug report: when I listen to a podcast then pause it and start listening to a song the bottom playback bar still shows the podcast and player notification is not being shown. Quite inconvenient. For everything else - thanks, I appreciate your hard work."
"App works well. No real issues with freezes, crashes, or bugs. The user interface (for me) is like everything else spotify; a little unintuitive and overcomplicated. As a service I thinkg it's a no-brainer; a massive library, free hulo with premium and now exclusive Joe Rogan."
"New Premium user here. Made the exodus once Google killed GPM. While the comparison between this and the new alternative YouTube Music is no contest- I'm surprised to find that I'm enjoying this better even than my old Google Play Music. Suggested Songs to Add has been an amazing feature in rebuilding playlists, and my Daily Mixes are eerily on point."
"Very well developed application, i can listen songs and podcast at same place. interface is well build and easy to use .It slow down my system, but it's fine consider the service"
I am glad that some of missing songs are available now after the agreement with WMG but still some songs are still missing compare to Spotify which is available in USA I know it would take some time but make it quick I can't wait and at the same time I am very excited. I hope you will draw your attention towards it Spotify india thank you boyz.
Honestly can't think of a complaint been paying for Spotify for a couple years now and one year they even gave me a Google mini that I still use. Genuinely nothing had I can say about this app. Maybe it could be cheaper but so could everything else üòÖ
"Excellent app. This is known as the perfect streaming service. Although there are a lot of ads in the free version, but still it is good in other criterion like accessibility and quality. The navigation is quite easy."
Best app for listening music best music... Biggest library..... I love spotify all the songs I need are available on spotify..... My thanks to the developer of spotify.... Just some UI issues for tablet otherwise the best music app... I request to change the UI of tablet spotify to the same as in mobiles
Spotify continues to offer a great service. It has enabled me to store different playlist to suit different situations and moods.
"I have been using Spotify Premium for over two weeks now and the experience has been exceptional. Easy to use, great curation, sharing capabilities, ability to play podcasts are some of my favourite qualities of Spotify. And great UI. Would highly recommend."
Joe Rogen brought me to Spotify. This fantastic app keeps me there. Cool discovery number 1: I prefer running the web version in Firefox on my killer Linux PC that is hooked to a nice sound system. The mobile app can control the web app sesmlessly. Very cool. PS: The music selection is UNBELIEVABLE!
Spotify is the best app for streaming music with curated playlists and great clean UI. My daily experience in Spotify free is awesome and it makes my every minute worth.üòã
"Best music streaming app on the market. Interface is simple, clean, and quick. Love that I can listen to music off line and share it with friends"
One of the finest apps to listen to music. Best radios and recommendations' algorithm as well. The UI seems to be sparkling too.
Just a solid app and service. What would the world be without Spotify? It runs smoothly and quickly (about 95% of the time) and has nearly every album on it you can imagine!
"It's an awesome app and it is exactly how I imagined that a music app should be. We can select the songs we like the most and make them into a playlist and then listen to them as they keep going continuously. This feature is actually very useful and we don't even require going to our phones and changing the songs after each one. This feature of this app is very useful, according to me. I will just say that this is the perfect music app."
"I am very pleased with this app and have upgraded to the premium service. The selection of music, playlists, and podcasts is large and suitable for my interests and taste. Since I am a senior, I believe that other seniors will be pleased with the offerings in Spotify."
Pretty much my go to music application. Does everything I require of it. Replaces all of my CDs and records into a manageable format.
Love It! As a previous 1user of Amazon Music for quite a while I thought I'd give Spotify a go. Its a breeze to use and practically an endless library.
"Amazing really, especially it's simple but beautiful ui and it's great algorithms and not to mention the sound quality, the heart badge's size was perfect in the previous version"
I love the app. My only critique is that it has no built in sound search function. Having to Shazam first before I add a song to a playlist is a tad inconvenient. ü•¥
"Honestly, after over 5 years of having Spotify premium I have to say it's worth the money, the amount of new genres/artists I have discovered is crazy. I've never had any major bugs, just minor glitches which got fixed in time and have used it on ios (3 years ago) android (the past 3 years) and on pc both windows and linux and the web client."
"Fantastic now! Great recommendations algorithm, good UI. Only wish it was simpler to find songs in your liked playlist without having to go through the three dot menu."
"Great experience, high quality sound and all my favourite artists in one place. Also default dark theme and intuitive UI."
This app is awesome . But I have a suggestion. Could u please give the guitar notes for the music u have?? Coz it would b really helpful for musicians to learn those melodies . This the only request I have. This app is super coolüëçüëç
This is such a nice app to browse music and also it keeps updating utself very quickly with newly released songs . and the daily mix which is given by the app is also very nice which allows you to listwn to new songs .
The UI/UX of Spotify is so so so good. Each version comes with marvelous design updates. The colours on the latest version is so balanced for the notification player. It just feels perfect and also it changes and fits according to the Song cover photo. Thank you so much Spotify team!!! You're an inspiration üòò
"Hello sir/maam, Here by I used Spotify since a year. It is an absolute music player. Hats off to your music player. But since a month I have a issue with your apk file. When I insert aux cable or connect with bluetooth, some times I don't hear song in earphones or via bluetooth device. When I restart my phone it works sometimes. So, I uninstalled your apk file and reinstall many time it doesn't work. Please give me any suggestions what I do."
I've tried them all and find Spotify to be the best music streaming service available. Great UI and has all the music and podcasts I want.
"Downgrading to 3 stars from 5 because even though it was a spectacular app, it's become frustratingly buggy over the past year woth updates, and with no good reason whatsoever, not like the UI or UX have been changed. Mighty strange, developers. Fix it ASAP please."
I love Spotify so much that my old phone permanently has a very visible screen burnout of the pause and play button/ layout burned on the screen. Definitely a recommend!
"Really user-friendly app. Makes finding artists & songs you love a breeze, builds you a new Playlist at least once a week based on what you have liked. Have to be on wifi or go premium to use outside"
"Spotify is well good. My only complaint is a few songs with sourced auidos get taken off for copyright, so being more lenient on the things like covers of songs and samples backingtrack would be great"
"Great app! Please continue to improve: - UI - song radio feature, as it can be the place for user to find similar songs of their taste - user ability to search within artist/album/other section"
One of the few apps that marries a reasonable free interface with a genuinely worthwhile pay-to-upgrade option! Great for playlists.
Still my favorite music app. I have used this almost every day for several years now. The playlist build feature is easy to use and flows well.
"The best music player in the world, even its algorithmic daily mixes are great. Easy to use with my Google home devices, and very quick downloads for playing tunes offline."
"I've been using Gaana for quite a while but in recent years I felt that Gaana just stucked to some fixed songs and mostly it acts like mp3 players where you have to tell everytime that what you want to listen. Now you're thinking that why I'm taking about Gaana on Spotify app's comments section...it's because I kinda like this app because I find a while new place to listen Music, podcast and calming tunes. Thank you developers for creating such beautiful app."
This app is easy to navigate and that beautiful UI makes it a pleasure to listen to music.If lossless formats were added it would be even better.
"Just had a great time using this service. Have used it for about 2 years and any problems I've had, support staff are very good at jumping on things as quick as they can. Huge recommend"
"The best thing in Spotify is playlist, all playlist has the best collection of songs. Then the easy UI makes it more usable."
This podcast is good for beginners or anyone looking for guidance in spells and wand work. The latest episode taught me lot about wands and has made me want to start searching for one that would vibe really well with me and encourage me to do more spell work. I am glad their is a podcast like this. I think it is absolutely amazing üëè üòç
"Great app, been using this platform for many years and have only ever had very minor issues if any. Creating playlists and finding music is very simple but sometimes the algorithms for recommending music can be quite questionable. Otherwise, 2 thumbs up."
"Have been using spotify since ages now, and in addition to the music streaming facilities, i really like their customer services. Whatever couple of issues i've had in the past could have taken longer had it been a different provider, whereas in this case my issues got resolved really quickly. Please keep up the good work."
"It's worth it in a way but.... Go to the shops and buy what u want, u are limited with the amount of space u have. I've had this for quite a while, so. 10 pound a month, after a while it seems not worth it. But who hates adds. Everyone. U decide."
Making playlists is almost instantaneous as its algorithms select songs that might seem familiar to the user as he or she adds songs they like. The app is quick to launch and loads songs even quicker. Premium has to be one of the best subscriptions I've ever made. Worth every penny
"Love that I can listen to a full album of any artist. Tool, Metallica, System of a Down, or even Disturbed. I have been playing Bass for 40 years now, I should learn all of Disturbed music on Bass amd go get that job, I think it would be a perfect fit. Hmmm I just might do that. Dan is the man on guitar love your chops brother."
"Look, I know this real-time lyrics thingy is just new but I hope that you'll also be able to translate the lyrics in the future just like the musixmatch app. And one more thing, please add playlist folders in mobile coz it's inconvenient to go to your pc just to do that. Edit: why can't i sign up in spotify? When i create an account the button just keeps loading forever. Pls fix this i can't create an account, I can't join our family plan :((((((((((("
The non pay expirence is good. I used it for a long time to make playlists that suited me much better than Pandora's random shuffles. After using it for over a year and getting my first job they had a special so I could try premium for three months no charge and I enjoyed the luxury of being able to play songs on demand. The big kicker was when I found out I could listen to maximum fun podcasts on it I decided that the 10 buck a month price for premium was well worth it for me.
"Spotify allows me to produce personal playlists to suit my mood, need ( like going to sleep. Setting the sleep timer is also useful for this) & appropriate music for locations in which I am driving."
"One of the best music player which i have ever seen among many others in the same segment. Beautiful UI, nice Searching system, Lyrics, syncing system (loved it) Everything is so much fine and fantastic. Kudos to your team. Thats why subscription is costly. Sorry but for me its too costly as now but one day I'll definitely take your subscription. üòäüòä"
I love that i can create my own play list and then i get great recommendations for similar ideas and i love the sleep timer feature! I know that I can listen to my guided meditation and not worry about needing to exit out of an app.
"I'm a Google Play Music castaway and Spotify is the best replacement for when GPM is discontinued in Oct. Easy-to-learn UI, similar to GPM, Spotify has songs that GPM didn't, and they offer a student discount unlike GPM so I'm spending a little less $/mo. I'm a GPM veteran and I highly recommend Spotify if you're like me and don't want anything to do with YouTube Music ;P Spotify is üëçüëç so far. HIGHLY recommend to GPM castaways."
"I've been a Spotify fanboy since before it launched in India, so there's a bias here. However, I don't think any other music app even comes close to Spotify for one key reason. It isn't about the catalogue..it's about the curation that Spotify does. No other app can really predict my music tastes quite as well as Spotify, and I depend on their daily mixes and their discover weekly playlists every single day."
I'd love to but I can't rate it 5 because it doesn't work when I want to listen using anything connected by Bluetooth. Tells me it's not available in my country (USA) However it works fine with normal wired earphones or with the phone built-in speaker. Is this a Spotify problem or Android? This problem doesn't exist with my other streaming apps. EDIT 22 Aug 2020: a reinstall worked. Rating updated
"awesome app, has every song i want and more!! and all my favorite podcast, annually crime junkies!!! the g.o.a.t. out all podcast. love the daily mix designed especially for your profile and couldn't ask for more. not a crazy amount of ads and premium enhances to experience to New levels."
"Pretty great for an music streaming app , i have been using it for free though , it would be great if you make some stabilising updates , ui improvements . But i love it the way it is ."
Its an amazing app for my youtube but theres a glitch and it really annoys me...When i press shuffle play songs either dont start or start but stop and i wanna know if that happens if the app doesnt update or if its just a bug...For an update can u add a button like shuffle play but if u press it it will play the songs that u listened to the most then the least is last because IM VERY STRESSED RIGHT NOW COS IF THIS APP DOESNT WORK THEN MY DAMN YOUTUBE CHANNEL IS GONE ;-; just plz help me..
This is really an awesome experince at whole another level with the live lyrics. The app design is too good. One of the that i dont appreciate about this app is too many adds....
"Low latency - searches are quick and comprehensive , very stable - very few dropouts if any, very good interface. Only problem for me is the sound quality, as I am one of those people who can hear the difference in quality. The quality is reasonable for casual and listening or background music but I would prefer that Spotify have a tier that has CD quality at least."
"Overall a great app, it has a few flaws like some lags in queue list and in shuffle and so...adding a lyrics option like in apple music will add A LOT to the app and to the user experience, most albums/singles that i looked for exist here and in various languages too, genius lyrics is a bit annoying and a toggle option for that would be good, fix the lags in the queue where song title gets stuck on the screen after dragging it from the list to the queue! Besides everything above the app is good"
"Spotify has become a part of my life that I can't live without. New lyrics feature is super cool.I'm a Spotify user from day one since they launched here in India.So I've experienced each and every major changes that they've made to make the current best experience.I'm really happy that they are constantly making changes to enhance the experience, great job developers as always. Suggestion: Search button on the playlist screen itself & long pressing the album art brings current 3 dot menu."
This app is great. My girlfriend had it along time ago and it has everything. This app has gotten me through alot of bad times. I thought about suicide and downloaded a few songs and it helped. This app changed my life. I have a whole new outlook. Thank you guys.
"I been listening to Spotify maybe for almost 6 years. But its just this month when I upgrade to premium. I love everything in Spotify other than the volume. From what I observed, Spotify music was quite modulated volume when i put on to max volume. But its fine, its only for my personal listening anyway."
"Great app for music. Nice design and great automatic personal playlists. Recommend trying out the pre-made 'mood' specific playlists, as these contain some fine hand picked tunes (you basically pay the music experts that make these if you have a subsctiption) that usually perfectly fits the description. Have never not found stuff I was looking for, as their music library contains basically all new music and a decent array of older albums as well."
"I've used nearly all major streaming services, I feel spotify fits best for my use amongst the others. I enjoy the UI theme and design, and the way it integrates with other devices. I've discovered more artists I've become appreciative of thanks to Spotify. I can honestly say i can't imagine my life without music, and Spotify provides me with more than exceptional service and ease of use. A solid 5 stars."
"Spotify is the best music app. But one problem ,only new songs by artists are appearing. What are you waiting for, click the install button. üëçüèª"
"This app suits my ideal type for songs as it is easy to operate, every song is available, and i can follow my favourite singer really it's a great app!!"
"Incredible! Able to build & edit my own playlists. Best indie & underground labels, hands down. Best catalogues. Excellent design & functionality! Affordable subscription service!"
"Awesome! Wish there was bigger selections of music because I listen to a lot of music that isn't mainstream. BUT I am happy I have more selection, easy to use/share/list building!"
I love this app! The personalized playlists are intuitive and have introduced my to many artists that have become favorites. Keep up the good music!
"Overall some nice piece of an app. On the bright side - pricing, sound quality, amazing daily suggestions and lots of new and cool music to discover. On the down side there's the app's UI. It's just unoptimized, or I could call it difficult to use, I think."
"The best streaming music app I ever used since 2k16, Pretty good UI, tons of playlists from official and other users. But the main useful feature that I always use is Device Connect, love it but sometimes the connected devices won't appears (almost every time), so I need to press play/pause from the device that I want to use. Please fix this."
Spotify is intuitive about what you enjoy listening to. I love the different playlists it puts together based on songs that you've listened to...
I love it. Can download the artist you love reasonable monthly prices for no commercials. Can make you own playlist and send to others when ever a song that reminds you of them quick an very easy. No issues at allüòä
"Amazing app. so glad i got it! Except now for some reason when I look up an artist, it won't take me to the list of songs that they make when I click on the names of them under the ""shuffle play"" button like it used to. It forces me to play the whole playlist instead which I don't like."
"I love music, and the artists I listen to deserve support. Spotify premium is my guilt free and cost efficient way to listen to/support all the artists I love. App has always been functional and smooth, while keeping things organized."
"TL;DR: The Spotify app has never been better. Long version: The most recent update has fixed every big issue I had with the app, and quality of life things that had been removed previously (namely the widget and the queue button in the bottom right) are thankfully back. There's still a couple issues, like sometimes a song's menu won't load because you're ""offline"", regardless of your connection or online status, but it's small enough to overlook. Thank you, Spotify dev team, I appreciate you."
"I've been using Spotify for years now and I'm hooked because the perks give you your money's worth. I love not having to deal with commercials. There are unlimited skips, I can choose and build my own playlists, there are sharing features and I can connect with other friends. Being able to use a mainstream music platform as an independent artist, it really changes the game for musical artists of our generation."
"Love the app! Student offer made premium a possibility. Love the UI!!! Wow, now it also shows lyrics for every song. Though some songs are not available in the app."
This is the only place I listen to music and I love building playlists. My only suggestion would be to make collaborative playlists an option. üíúüíú
"Apple music is fodder compared to this. The app is very easy to operate and the occasional UI updates keep the app feeling fresh. The family plan is really great if your getting Spotify for multiple people, SIX premium accounts for 15 bucks, great deal. Thousands of playlist updated daily for whatever you feel like listening to. Not that much to say really everything about this is great and no other listening service compares to it"
I'm addicted! One of the best UIs and algorithms to understand music. My discover weekly tracks are on-point every time!
It's the best music app you can download on your phone to listen to any type or any artist and all kinds of music to listen to while you are at work or walking or relaxing or whatever you want to do and it doesn't kill your phone battery as quick as like YouTube will because Spotify you can still listen to it when you lock your phone but other music apps you can leave the app or it will turn your music off. Spotify is where it's at.
This is my go-to app for all music now. Best part I love about them is podcasts. I just love listening to them. It has very easy interface and good design.. 30sec ad in free version is the only problem. Which I think is fair enough for free version
I was a Google play music subscriber from the very beginning. Google play music moved to YouTube music and the GUI /experience was awful...plus I lost my YouTube Red subscription and Google didn't even tell me. I tried several different streaming services and Spotify's the best by far for me.
"So many music in good quality for free. Ads are not often, and not annoying at all. Actually quite on point, and sometimes funny or interesting. Very great app"
"Good music app, quite better than other, but as service luck a lot of music that I like, when Google music actually have it. Spotify app very comfortable with accurately made playlists."
"Musikk is my life and spotify satifys every need all day EVERYDAY.. From streaming to downloads. Even builds new ""DISCOVERY"" Playlist based on songs you listen to and genres.. Builds playlist of related artists you listen to and keeps EVERYTHING ORGANIZED JUST THE WAY I WANT with no effort..DOESNT EVEN USE LOT OF BATTERY..SPOTIFY PLAYS ON MY PHONE XBOX PS4 COMPUTER EVERYDAY.. AND NEVER LETS ME DOWN!!!!!! Never have i ever had a problem from this app AND FOR THAT WE THANKX YOU"
*_my phone doesn't have touch in alot of places so i can't create an account i have to use rotation but when i use rotation turn it upside wrote everything needed for creating an account but when i turned it upright i couldn't touch the done button despite all of this i know that this is a great app so i'm giving it 5 stars_*
"Love the service and the app, too. üòç It would be a nice feature to add that playlist could be searchable when adding new songs while listening. ü§û Otherwise, the app works smooth and has the best UI amongst similar (streaming and non-streaming) music players in Google Play Store. It's easy to use, looks stunning and all features can be accessed just when they are needed to be on hands."
"Love, love, love Spotify! Have all the songs I want! Even if I'm not paying for premium, the ads are quick, and often get the chance to skip the ads. Premium rocks!!!"
I have used this app for a very long time and it hasn't failed me. In fact i would say it has served me well. I listen to a lot of music so this is quite convenient. That being said spotify premium is essential since without it you cant listen offline or listen without adverts
"Have not got a single ad since I installed, most songs are present, so thats great. But i hope there will be a feature to quickly transfer some songs from one playlist to other. And many songs still havent got any lyrics. The algorithm should be changed such that i get songs to add to my playlist recommended on the basis of whats ON my playlist and not what I added recently to the playlist, cause I keep getting the same recommendations."
"I really love Spotify. Not gonna lie. One of the best digital platforms that updates real quick right after someone releases a new song. However, I think the price for premium is a bit pricey for me because I'm a student. Overall, I enjoy using Spotify!! #recommended"
i did not think i woudld love them like this but i deffinetly do. Especially if you take the etra couple bcks and ppay for premium. i love it. but i will admit that it doses not have quite a few songs. sothat bothered me a little. but i got on youtube an was fine ... and then right back to the app jesus lol
"After trying out quite a few music apps, I can honestly say that personally I have found Spotify to be the best. After receiving 3 months free, downloading anything I wanted, my direct debits began. I was sent an email reminding me that my 3 months trial was coming to an end, and asking me what day did I want this to happen on each month. If I've had any queries regarding music or their store they have been very prompt in replying and always extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend."
Super quality unlimited music at a very competive price. I have not yet managed to stump them and I have to say that they have an exceptional variety of genres on offer. They also mange to provide daily lists of music built to fit your every taste. Great Stuff!!
Spotify listened to its users and reverted disliked changes to their app. I no longer have any issues with the app and it works perfectly as intended. Genuinely appreciate this music service and company. Thank you for caring.
Intelligible music app... Quite reliable to free one from stress. Just tip in your vibe and listen then go on with whatever you are doing.
"Everything you need, every album, quick searchs, rad playlists. Excessively conventional with device pairings. Definitely makes mp3 players obsolete."
Best feature is you don't need a subscription to try the app unlike 'some fruit name' music app. Btw I have the yearly subscription and only because is so good. It is my first subscription based service that I've ever spent my money on.
"Spotify music has quite wider selection, gives bigger choices. You can hear music from every corner of the globe - you are not a stranger on Spotify."
"Spotify is simple to use. I am not technically advanced, so easy is a must. Then there is the music, I get what I want quickly and go on with my work."
"As a member of the 60s onward and back era I am reliving my musical past. Loving it, and pleasing surprised I still can sing and air guitar most of them. Egually I most have missed a lot. Long live the crochet and quaver. Particularly like the Live stuff. Long live musical talent."
"The application is very good, but please put the repeat button back in because I really miss it. And please don't put any more music from you in the playlists, I mean you should first ask us if we want extra music you should first ask us if we want extra music you should first ask us if we want extra music from you"
"Best app for music. I live in Russia and only now we can use Spotify, finally! So good quality, no bugs, awesome design, works even with terrible connection in good quality."
"Undoubtedly the best streaming service here in India. I've tried all the major ones over the past few years, switching between apps countless times. Finally when Spotify resolved all the issues in Indian version, there's no going back. It has wider library esp for English, best app design, and far better music recommendation than any other services out there."
"I would say, this is the best application to listen to the music in terms of every kind of experience.the user UI is really great which allows user to navigate easily in app.the most amazing thing i like about the app is it has really good utility of song recommendation. You can find the whole playlists of your favourite genre made by spotify and users all around the web.the premium version of app allows user download music offline so we can listen to songs without using the data again."
"I love Spotify! I love how you can listen to whole albums of your choice, i love the selection of their artist radio stations and I love the Playlists they set up for you based on your listening. It is very intuitive. I'd give it more stars if I could. üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"
I have never found an App more Perfectly suited to me and the way I prefer listening to music everyday!! Really easy to figure out & it has the best recommendations for you!! ( Lastly it's perfect for us Dark Theme fanatics ) :P
"The best music streaming service on the market. Definitely would recommend, also the prices in USD are reasonable, but I live in Russia and if talking about IT'S prices, they're SO low (In a good way!) that they just make Spotify a good deal when choosing between what's already available in here, crushing alternatives into dust. The overall quality of music is awesome, when you have premium, design of the app (both desktop and mobile) are giving ONLY what YOU need. 5 Stars - it is."
"It is a top-notch app, if we're talking about music. Spotify has the largest music database, very easy to use, reasonably cheap subscription, the automatic playlists are tailored to suit my experience and emotion. 10/10, would recommend anyone, who likes to listen to the music for long periods of time."
"Overall a very good experience and music quality, and at this point I think I'm not cancelling my subscription anytime soon. One suggestion, though: please get rid of as many of the sharp corners from the user interface as you can. The design looks outdated, it would look a lot ""newer"" with more rounded corners."
"I like this app, I like it's simplicity and design, vast collection of songs, still has lot of collection to be added of the past, never the less. I appreciate the effort of this app"
"I've been using pandora premium for 10 years or so and I officially quit. After using Spotify for a month, omg what a difference a little TLC does...Pandora as an app and a service has so many issues that they just don't fix and the ease of use is never improved...Spotify runs smoother, faster and so far way more reliable and it seems like they're servers are way better. Spotify also has so much more content then pandora...SPOTIFY 500M+ DOWNLOADS / PANDORA 100M+ DOWNLOADS...There's a reason"
"I've been using Spotify for quite some time now, absolutely love it, its the only streaming source for music I use, has everything I could possible want, and then some, I look forward to discover weekly, and release radar, where I find tons of new songs that I like, some from artists I know, and lots from ones I've never heard of, but enjoy listening to, would highly recommend this app to any fan of music, to me, there isn't a better one out there."
"It's a great app for playing music, but only if you have the subscription. The free version is not that great as you can't play any song you like. I guess spotify is for listening to playlists while doing something else, but I use it instead of youtube because it doesn't require so much internet so I want to be able to choose songs."
Good app. I would suggest removing the button for letting songs disappear in Spotify completely. I clicked that one way too often unintentionally.
"Love this app, but I have one suggestion. When you make a radio off of a Playlist there should be a button to add the song directly to the Playlist that the radio is based on."
"Love the wide range of songs. Thanks to Spotify, now I'm listening and enjoying never before heard songs too. And most importantly, it has made me forget my inbuilt music player. Can uninterruptedly listen songs on the go. Keep up the good work, guys!!"
Spotify is my way of getting back to my self and when the day is done all I do is push a button & realax ! To my favorite tunes bye god hand and Spotify I relax and enjoy the Toon's thank you so much for playing the things I like .!
"As a really old mod and musician who loves his, what might be called, antiquated music system. I've found through Spotify a means to listen to my favourites and quickly. Love technology"
"This is by far the best music app I've ever used. It's compatible with all softwares and syncs easily with the Musixmatch app. I'd definitely recommend this for online music. For downloading songs and such, Premium us required but Spotify Premium is extremely cheap and affordable too!"
"Love it, haven't had an issue with it for years... like 4 years! I love how intuitive they are of my tastes and select whole playlists for me and I always dig them"
"Best way to listen to your music on demand, way better than YouTube as there isn't add after add and you can save your song list to one place and make multiple different playlists to suit the occaction. Also you can listen while offline witch is a massive plus"
Still the best streaming service available. Intuitive menu and reasonable suggestion of music to listen to.
"Spotify is the best music app, you can build your own playlist and you can listen to hundreds and hundreds of good songs. I love this app and I think that is better than all the music apps. So thank you Spotify for give to me and to millions of people good music to enjoy Everytime and everywhere."
"Pirate to paid user. Back then I used pirated/cracked Spotify, because I just made the jump from Winamp. I wasn't sure how good the app on Windows. But then, slowly I realised I cant lived without them. At a fair price, gladly to say I'm a big fan since 2013 to 2020. Cheers Spotify! Mobile and PC version. To make Spotify more awesome: - MQA or higher studio quality playback - A deleted playlist section (Because I accidentally deleted my fav playlist awhile ago, its a nightmare to rebuild)"
"Spotify has been my go to for years now, and has never failed to give me relevant songs and good recommendations based on what I'm listening to. The app is user friendly, and pairs seamlessly between your pc and phone, while still being able to switch between the two easily, no pairing required."
Spotify has few features that most other streaming services lack and that's what makes it stand out more. I enjoy various daily music and their recommendation system is quite good.
"Best app for premium subscription, every other app followed suit. I have access to pretty much every album ever with auto mixes made for me. Even underground artists."
"Four years of using Spotify everyday: best music streaming service ever. Algorithm for recommending songs is on-point, controls and UI are really concise, and the library has improved dramatically. Overall, can't recommend it enough. God bless the devs."
The integration between devices is phenomenal. The user experience is one of the best in the market. My only complaint would be regarding limited library due to licensing issues in India. My verdict: Go for it if the available library fulfills your needs
I love Spotify! I have been using it for years and so far there is no artist or song I can't find! I cancelled my other music streaming platforms to use Spotify exclusively. I love how easy it is to build playlists and now there are podcasts on it as well!! One stop shop!
"I have never had any issues with this app. I like it better than any other music/podcast app out there, but there ARE quite a few ads. üòÇ"
This app is great. I love this program. You could find any song you want to see in this app. The capabilities of this program include: Download Quick Update High Variety
Great app to listen to music on. Only problem is that sometimes it'll play multiple long ads in a row which can be quite annoying.
Clean and minimalistic interface. Big icons and buttons to easily access during a run. Best thing is your discovery weekly. I love new playlist suggestion that is based on my taste. Playlist is a better option that suggesting individual tracks because it help me to listen to the same playlist routinely during workout and other routine tasks.
"Very simple, clear and intuitive. Easy to navigate and everything is very sensibly laid out. I've been with Spotify Premium for several years now and I have no intention of leaving. However, I wish there was a feature which would allow the user to suggest a song they wish to see on the app that isn't already added. That would be cool. Because there are still many songs that aren't available (some for contractual reasons and some I'm not sure why they aren't available.)"
"Personalized playlists that are actually good, great selection, smooth user experience. Easily would reccomend to anyone."
"A great music app. Not only is it free, its very easy to browse music, store your own music, make many play lists and also every genre of music to suit and soothe all tastes. My favourite app."
"I do love it. Basic spotify has so much going for it by itself. Screen off, great music quality, and even your own equalizer to suit it to you better"
"I recently faced a problem in signing in because of some error I contacted them I appreciate there quick response and they solved it within 24 hours. Great service, MUST App for music + podcast lovers."
"definitely not regretting getting spotify premium, A+ song selection, great quality, an overall good time. however i do have a problem with the app, for some reason im not able to share the song im listening to instagram like other users are doing. this kinda sucks because i paid good money for the premium experience, and i feel like im not getting the maximum value out of it, a quick fix would be much appreciated, keep up the great work."
Love this app! I pay for premium since its the only music app I listen to and find all my podcasts at. It rarely glitches and its intuitive. Just great!
"Spotify is one of the most reliable, easy to use, functionally superior, smart, fast, fun, and intuitive apps out there - I could go on. It's awesome for music lovers."
"I love Spotify, its okay free but premium is really good. I like that i can add my computer songs to playlists so i can listen through my phone and that i get relevant recommendations and artist releases. I would really love a menu button to show your friends activity like on desktop though üôÇ"
I think its the best music app i have ever used. Its the fastest music player it never buffers . Its UI is faboulous. It has the largest collection of music. I just loved it.
"Used for over 8 years now. Clean, simple ui, good choice of tunes only missing a few biggies, and surprisingly simple billing and account management (went normal-student-family with same account). Good podcasts too, they're clearly moving with the times, and and the music recommendations are decent, I like seeing others playlists and what my pals are listening to. Don't really see why I'd rate any lower that 5/5! Cheers."
"I can't put my screen to sleep b/c it will stop playing music.. It happens about 50% of the time. This is a breaking update. I literally have to wake my screen to continue playing and it stops again when screen turns off. On Galaxy S8+, Android ver. 9, One UI 1.0"
"I love being able to pick out music I enjoy, and being able to save it to my Library, its easy to find, and loads quickly! Thank you Spotify!"
"Great app, quite a few bugs with playback between devices and the UI, but on the whole I use this app every day and it does me proud. :) (please keep the widget)"
Spotify is amazing app that I have ever used. I found all songs and albums of any movie and artist. There is a üíì button which helps me to store songs when any songs hit my ears and it makes my playlists for me only.
"Switching to other app, thanks you for ruining my time, everytime I try to load my liked songs, it gives me your liked songs will appear here, I waited for eternity, It never came, I'm tech savvy so I know the workarounds, but it successfully has become annoying, Adios!!!!! Thank you spotify for all your bugs!!!!!!!"
It is a wonderful App bringing together the best of songs and music. The UI is equally simple and easy for selecting onr's choice of music.
"Excellent! Lots of era's of music to choose from if you like a various of genres, although I have noticed the older the song, the quieter the sound if connected to a wireless speaker. Overall happy with the service for the price, wouldn't pay more than ¬£9.99 per month though."
"First time getting music on phone. I'm 60 yrs old. Ellen is right. Pick Spotify when choosing your music. Classic rock & roll, blues, even solo guitar playing. I'm very satisfied."
No words but could say that it is a lakh times better than gaana the design of the app is very simple and attractive and also it provides a good quality music and each and every song can be avalible on this app which made me force myself to install itüòäwonderful app!!
This is absolutely the best app for streaming music! Awesome UI and all!...just for the non- premium versions the ads could be a bit lesser...that's the only issue although I've got the premium but when on non premium I faced this really bad issue of pop up ads...hope you guys can lessen the ads a bit. And that would make it the most perfect app for streaming music and podcasts!
"The best music player I ever used in my life... The most amazing thing is even the free version has controlled and less amount of ads, then the best feature is the song radio if you play a song then it automatically plays all the songs that are like the one you played, amazing and smooth experience, the interface gives a premium feeling and the song in the inbuilt playlists are updated daily."
We are enjoying music like we haven't for decades. Spotify effortlessly guides us to old favorites and new finds. We use Spotify with Sonos which play very well togethet.
I think this is a good app it gives you free music and all it requires is your email. It does have adds but adds help different businesses throw out to people there new ideas and stuff you wouldnt really know about the new stuff in your fav stores if it wasnt for adds.
"Second favourite music app, and this only gets better! Quite user friendly and very useful. A portion of my favourite songs are just random ones that Spotify suggested i listen to, its great for finding new music. I dont normally comment but Spotify deserve some commendation."
"Spotify has and always will be my number one app for music streaming. Spotify's great UI design makes the use of the app so streamlined and easy. New features are constantly being added to improve upon this further. Also, it's use of personalised playlist is unrivaled. It will consistently suggest songs from big named artists you may be sleeping on to underground artists on the rise. I swear this app knows my music taste better than I do"
This app has huge collection of songs. Also the sound quality is very good . Spotify is one of the most well designed apps out there. It's beautiful and a joy to use. I Love it. ‚ù£Ô∏è
"App is generally intuitive and easy to use. It also plays tracks in the correct order, which Apple play does not."
This is the best music streaming platform I've come accross till now. This gets better for oppo users coz they can pair it up with their inbuilt equalizer to get great quality music with out using any third party apps which is great.
"Dear dev teams. I found it pretty annoying that the ""hide this song"" button is where ""Add to playlist"" used to be at. I miss click it a few times and lost the song i want to add. Could be just me. But it would be great if you could move it lower or something. Thankyou"
It's very easy to use . And to find your favorite artists and songs are easy to find also . Great recommendations of genre you listen to the most . I would recrecommend this app over any others . Mr. Dexter Jagneaux
"Such an awesome app. Love it. Pay your artists more, though. And extend the Weekly Discover! The algorithm is just perfect! I eat up the new tracks all too quickly! Thanks guys!"
I love the changes and tweaks to the UI over the years. Its super user friendly and has an immense library of music to listen to.
"Great way to listen to music and podcasts. I appreciate that the main page is designed to keep track of the type of music and podcasts I enjoy listening to, and similar options. Thank you for the great service."
"I have been using YouTube and paying the $10/mo for the no ads, and I seriously thought that's all I needed for a few years.. then a buddy of mine told me to download Spotify, so I did!!! Spotify, unlike Pandora or Youtube Red after I started to like a few songs spotify immediately started recommend great songs that I never heard, but enjoyed. Youtube and pandora still dont have down quite right yet but the spotify team is doing a noticeable better job. Thanks."
"This is an Amazing app! The best part is the seamless connectivity between devices - I play on my laptop, then it automatically syncs with my other devices like phone and TV. Again, I would say it's an incredible app, with an easy-to-follow UI Interface üåü"
Spotify is amazing there nothing wrong with this app I would recommend you use this because I would say it's one of the best apps to use for quick songs you would like to listen to it's is also has great sound and quality when you buy premium it make everything better now you can listen to your favrioute songs with no ads what so ever and as a long time user of premium I would know so so ignore all of the bad comments and give Spotify a try and maybe you will like it just as much as I like it üòÉ
"Very nice app with premium, but i have a suggestion. I like to personalize my playlists, so i make custom covers. Its only possible to change them on computer and iPhone. So if you would add a feature to Android to be able to change them from mobile on Samsung etc. Would be very helpful to quickly change it from mobile."
It has very good custom Playlists built around your listening experiences to help you discover new music that you may find interesting. It also works well offline and is very optimized and easy to understand.
App freezes while listening. major upset when it happens Edit it freezes when I use phone back <- button instead of app back <- button... just found it.. Now it's fine
Great value the first 3 months free is deffo a good draw but a lot of amazing music to choose from my only negative thing to say is the no skip button and you have to manually change a song
"This is an amazing app, and does quite a lot for free! It's almost a blessing, really. The least I could do is recommend this, because I find whatever song I'm looking for, even stuff that isn't necessarily from popular artists. 10/10, would recommend."
"I left to try some other platforms but kept comparing them to this one. Great UI and nearly 100% of the obscure music I sometimes enjoy can be found with ease. The only change I would like to see is the option to have 'shuffle all' option for my playlists, rather than creating an additional playlist entirely. A happy family userü•∞ Love love LOVE Spotify!!!!!"
One of the best music services out there. Love how intuitive the app is and how seamless it connects to my smart home speakers all around the house.
"I've just switched to Premium and made playlists using the app on my Samsung phone. However when I try and play my list, each track dies just before the end and next track is not played. In free version, I didn't have this problem and also album tracks play one after another so it appears to be a playlist problem. UPDATE: I just fixed the problem by reinstalling the app. Still annoying tho! PS: I contacted the tech team (email is listed below) and they were very helpful and responded quickly"
"I love this app! I love the playlists that you can build. There are short adds in the free version, but after the ad you get 30 minutes of ad free listening"
"No words to express how happy I am to use and review Spotify..! I was using Wynk earlier and the buffer mode used to be functioning more than the song playlist..which led to very bad user experience..!.. But,with Spotify, all is really going well. This works very well in both urban and rural areas.The application is very user friendly and also I can finally listen to songs without putting my patience to test. Thank You Spotify..!"
"I love that there's options for premium rather than just one rate. It makes me exceedingly happy that the Spotify team is so comfortable with offering cheap premium such as the family plan. It shows they care about their consumers edit: I've figured out how to play without opening the app, and I'm pretty sure the music playing after I removed my aux cord is a glitch with my j3 prime. edit: just found the sleep timer! Took a little digging but I'm happy now!"
"Spotify is hands down the best streaming service today. It always plays music I'm feeling, the premium actually feels like it's worth the money. The customer support is quick, I've been using Spotify for the past 8 or 9 years. And I've built up a HUGE playlist. I'd give it a 100/5 if possible"
They are amazing and it is fun to talk on here and you can do alot on here as well it it's good for each other and to have a serious conversation with each other and wow just alot of fun I can't wait to get on here and also we can build up each other advice and help one another out when is needed too.i love this apps cause it really helps out alot so I could keep in touch with all me families and friends specially the one that you truly honor and love the most and cherish every moments every day
I don't like that you can't select multiple tracks to move to a playlist or delete them or mark them. You can't select multiple playlists to delete or move or mark too. Extremely annoying and painful to do everyone separately its a quite a cumbersome way manipulate them.
This app is one of the best ways to get new and awesome music. It also shows in time different music that would suit you and match to your likings.
"Simply put -> Best streaming app there is, and it gives me the best music experience for a really low price. Totally forgot about my inbuilt music app. üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ"
"Probably the best music app. Great UI, Great Sound Quality, Great Playlists and podcasts. I would suggest you to add some more hindi songs as it sometimes happens that i cannot find some old hindi songs here. Otherwise, Its the best music app. Also you are increasing the number of adds, please dont do that."
"Good app...very useful for me but still unable to find some music and songs, some albums , plz share all the movie songs and background music like by piano guiter violin ( I fond of those music mostly) under the banner of movie name ... I couldn't find some albums of song sung by Bangladeshi singers, those songs are not so old but unavailable... Plz make it available.."
Mostly super. My battery optimizer completely ruined the Google Home experience with Spotify and it took a long time to figure. Spotify should automatically check and ask to disable it.
"Once you learn to navigate the app, Spotify(Premium) is Awesome. I listen to some weird music and Spotify manages to deliver on its suggestions (even when some of my musicians have less than 100k listeners). Lots of choice for Jazz fans too. Thank you Spotify for showing me Louis Cole, Shrek is Love, Thundercat. Thank you Forgotify for allowing me to create the FORSAKEN HITS playlist."
"Had an issue, support was quick and helpful. All the music and almost all podcasts I want to listen to. Superb user experience with premium and easy to use app."
I can't live without Spotify anymore. The app is intuitive and easy to use. You can use it to connect to other devices and control what is being played. I'd recommend this.
The best music app for high quality audio. The UI is amazing in the app. The recommendation algorithm works amazingly well providing you tracks based on your listening history and likes .
"ot's amazing...., when i switch volume level to quite, i feel that i'm diving deep in songs in spotify premium very high music quality.üëåüëåüëåüëå ....i'm fallin in love with this app bcz of its podcast which are avipable in english, so i loveüòªüòª this app ever...."
"Pros: Buttery smooth UI almost like YouTube music. Huge collection of songs. Plays the songs faster than any other music app with even limted connection. Very less ads than any other app out there. Very well made clean app. Cons : Lyrics option is the confused üòï part. Most of the songs don't display lyrics and even if few other songs displays it, they are overwritten by story and we won't be able to view the lyrics which is annoying. There should be an option to disable story in lyrics."
After a slight hiccup back in April I was concerned that this was no longer the music app for me. But I am really happy that whatever was causing my app to crash is no longer happening and I am once again listening quite happily
"Love this app , premium version is worth it no commercials or ads and u can rewind and download for offline use ..... Does require some space specially if downloaded music for offline but I highly recommend to everyone !!"
"i accidentally deleted everything and an hour later it was automatically restored. the 1960's equivelent would be if you had a giant record collection, but lost it in a fire... and then it magically reappeared an hour later. we are living in the future, thank you spotify people."
"Perfect 5 ..Superb collection and ability to use between devices is amazing .. Playlists are just amazing , superb intuitive logic on song selection."
"Great app love the premium fam pack. Best value, for sure. Only bad thing I can say is that occasionally it will stop playing after 2.5 songs... can't quite figure that one out. But other than that its great!"
Love Spotify! I have tried lots of streaming services but Spotify has the edge. Slick interface and its algorithms and design make new music discovery effortless.
It is best free Version Music Streaming app in the world. It shows you relevant and genuine ads unlike other apps. It has a huge collection of songs. üëçüèª
"Been quite happy with the app and service thus far, didn't know how I went about the world without having a music streaming service, as it's been absolutely wonderful to expand your taste."
After constant using of 6 months I'm in love with Spotify. No other can beats this app as of free version. I've got all of my requirements from here. Also quality and collection matters. Thanks to developers.üíìüíöüòç
"All the music I love (even though some of it is quite old) . Easy to navigate, and the suggestions made by Spotify are for music that is exactly to my taste,"
Spotify has become part of my daily routine. It's so amazing to have a Premium service where you know you get top quality content in an amazing intuitive user interface. This work from home situation becomes so much easier when you know you have great music from every genre and great podcasts from the best in the world at your fingertips.
Spotify is the best but I accidently Uninstalled it then downloaded it back and now can't log back in. Spent hours and hours building playlists. This is really bumming me out. Please help!
I used to use pandora but spotify is way! Better. My only suggestion for improvement is to have something like a thumbs down or unlike button to not play songs you dont want to hear from artist you like.
"I enjoy listening to new music before I go to bed every night. Spotify offers a variety of music such as soft and calming music, meditation, sounds of nature and many other ones to help you to sleep. They even provide you with a new variety of music that suits your needs on a regular basis it's amazing! I highly recommended it to all my friends and they also enjoy it as much as me."
I have only been using the free version for a few weeks and it is great for listening to music on my phone. I don't know what the paid version is good for or if they will eventually require me to pay to continue listening.
"Spotify is one of my favorite examples of good user experience. One of the best features is listening on different devices. I can start by listening with my phone and a Bluetooth soundbar, then switch to playing from my Echo in another room, then switch to playing from a web client in a third room. Great while working on different projects in different rooms throughout the day."
"Must have app for music fans. Absolutely awesome, dynamic app that never falters. For ¬£9.99 a month I've all the music I could ever need at the tap of a button. This app is also brilliant and discovering new artist's for you and will continue to play music similar to what you've chosen. So the music never stops. An album finishes and Spotify finds more suitable music for you. Best ¬£9.99 a month ever. Also you can link this app to PlayStation and many many other devices."
I love the variety of songs and the ability to listen to the songs offline I also love that there are so many podcasts available to me at the click of a button and that's one of the best music apps I've used.
Really professional UI and the suggestions of songs and the quality if the music are awsome. It feels very comfortable to use and those who using the Spotify will not switch to any other apps.
"Absolutely amazing app!!!! There are quite a lot ads if you don't get premium but it's still really good without premium! I would recommend premium because it lets you listen to music with no ads, listen offline and it lets you listen wherever you are. This app has such good quality music and lets you listen to anything! Plus it doesn't take up hardly any of your storage. Thank you."
"Easy to use and create a play list and skip through, subject to the options you have selected. There are a wide variety of music genre's and all at a click of a button. Spotify also collates sings you listen to and provides selection of song you may want to listen to, in cluding the options of listening to your favourites artists songs or play lists and a radio option and new releases. Some. Time. Spotify can freeze but for a few minutes."
"I was with the -other- music service for a long time and I kind of listened to a lot of the same stuff over and over, and only found new stuff I liked with Soundhound. Since I finally switched to spotify, after reading rave reviews about its music suggestions algorithm and intuitive playlists, I never looked back. I constantly get playlist suggestions that are in tune with my general preferences and I keep discovering great artists. I really love it."
Up to date in new tracks and great quality when streaming. Quite a wide range of music more than any music apps I used before.
"Great content and interface! Ability to use the app seamlessly between devices live is amazing. The user interface, is friendly, and the user experience is excellent. The best app in the world for music lovers. Highly recommended!"
The perfect answer for those who love music of all genres. I have been delighted by the depth of the Spotify catalogue and the clever way it opens doors to artists tou never knew existed which quikly become firm favourites. Excellent!
"I love Spotify, I can find pretty much any song or artist with just a few taps of a button. I love music so this app is perfect for me and my music needs."
"Spotify is fantastic. but there are connectivity issues for me. quite often. kind of a bummer but I'm a dodo head, so i stay subscribed. edit: left for a year but I'm back baby! 2k20"
"Seriously man it has almost all the international content. I am a ginormous fan of jpop and jrock. Spotify has all the latest artist's releases and almost all the artists' collections.Great and convenient UI and dark theme,which I am fond of.Great experience of the shift to spotify from savn."
"One of the things I liked the most about Spotify are the new song recommendations that are made based on our fav songs..it knows quite well what songs we will like, most of the times, thus helped me discover more songs that are to my liking :)"
"The connectivity of this app is excellent. I self intuitively finds all your device to allow you to listen to your music, laptop,phone, smart TV, car etc. Just simply works, and clean clear non interrupted music. Also gives you daily lists of the kind of music you like best by narrowing down your taste in music."
"Best music app, been using for 6 years. Would love to see a feature where I can create a playlist and the song start time can be customised. Other than that, all the updates and ui changes over the years has always been great. Get it now"
"I like the variety of the way I can listen, from the quality, to listening to only the song I searched for or continue to listen to song that are similar, or adjusting the built-in EQ to match my audio system."
"As an engineer that build apps as a professional, I appreciate Spotify to the fullest. Thank you for becoming such a service/product. Spotify is simplictically beautiful."
Haven't come across any song I could not find in the nearjinfinite Spotify library. Reasonably good AI with regards to its ability in working out my taste in music. Quality from my Samsung Galaxy S10 is more than satisfactory. Adverts are not too obtrusive; I quite enjoy the disruption - feels more like listening to radio. Highly recommended.
Really good playlists based on your search history. Appropriate customization. Still can be improved over UI.
I used all the available apps on playstore. Spotify is one of best i found. Its very well designed to get you kind of music you want to listen.
I like the interface since it makes it easy for me to find some of the features quite easily. The music selection is insane so i am quite happy with it.
"The first week was amazing! I got the exact music I wanted to, guessing the premium subscription. Spent the whole week perfecting Playlist and building my library, skipping the songs i didnt want to hear. Then the first week ended and it's commercials and only 6 skips out of music that isn't in your playlist. I can no longer use my library so my whole first awesome week, was a waste of time! Thanks spotify, back to Pandora which is about the same, but they didn't waste a week of my life."
"Epicsauce, except songs arent available everywhere which is a tad bit annoying. Living in a smaller country like Sweden it can be hard to find all the songs you want, though since the unavailable songs are quite few it doesnt really matter too much. Overall, a great app."
The only app I use for music. They actually have Playlists designed just for you that are made daily. I love this app better than Pandora and if you have Spotify Premium then you get Hulu for free.. You can't beat that deal!
"Switched between lots of music streaming (deezer Napster Amazon Google apple etc) and this it one of the better ones. It doesn't have as high quality kbps as deezer but makes up for it in the ui, recommendations and available songs"
"Absolutely love this app!! I've upgraded to premium and find it so much better to listen to my favourite songs without all the disruption of ads. I enjoy listening to music either while I'm cooking, cleaning house, in the shower, BBQ-ing, cruising, or cutting the grass in summer or shoveling snow in winter (using my wireless Bluetooth headset of course lol)"
"Very impressive indeed. Intuitive contols and settings. Ease of operation. Wonderful array of artists. Previously I had iTunes and I was sceptical of Spotify. But now I won't go back to iTunes/Apple. Everything I need is here at Spotify. And I am an ""older"" user at 60 years of age. I recommend it to all."
"I enjoy listen to Spotify :)). There are many available songs and the podcasts are awesome!! There are ads, and though they are quite annoying, I don't really mind them :)))."
Recently I've shifted to Spotify app to listen podcasts and music both. One good thing about this app is that it takes quite less mobile data to buffer songs online as compared to others providing high quality voice quality. Area of improvement is more Bollywood songs can be added in the library.
Offers high quality music free of cost. Also the UI of this app is very attractive and convenient to use. Hands down best song streaming app.
"The App is amazing, it is really user friendly, and it has all my favorite artists on it. The UI is great too. What more could a person want? Way to go spotify, you have done a great job. I haven't found a better app for listening to my favorite artists and albums. Playlists are spot on as well. Thank you for all you do to make this app as great as possible!! Keep up the good work!!"
"Discovering songs new and old that I never could have never afforded or had access to growing up buying cds and vinyl. Would be better if the artists could make more money through Spotify. My only niggles is having to drag and drop songs when I edit playlist to put them the order I want. If was a way to make quicker would be perfect, very time consuming. And I have to constantly block ty segall cover of everyone's a winner, it seems to come on my daily playlists/discover. Song does my nut in"
Love having a premium family account. I enjoy it more than Pandora because if I want a certain song I can just look it up. Ive discovered so much good music based on my taste and the daily mixes they build off of your taste are great. I absolutely love Spotify. No commercials no bs.
I live on Spotify üòÇ my only complaint is the shuffle-only on standard accounts on mobile. If I'm allowed to pick specific songs on a computer...but I digress. I genuinely like Spotify better than Apple Music üëçüèª
"Fab! Allows me to get music of any genre when away from traditional music sources or don't fancy the radio. Great being able to search & save songs to a mixed playlist. I don't use premium as ads don't bother me, but can see the benefit of being able to play without wifi or data. The preset choice of playlists is great, especially when you need something specific, such as meditation or something to suit a group of people with different tastes. Definitely an app I wouldn't be without."
Great customer service. Really enjoyed the convience of texting through my problem with the student plan. Very nice operator. Spotify really is a game changer in my life. Helped me learn guitar and learn music. Love this app.
"Amazing algorithm, finds related music very well. Great UI. But I sometimes get the same song in shuffle mode. Check that out."
It's great. The song queuing is a great feature and the offline listening to downloads is great especially when traveling when there is no phone service
Bust a hard drive and lost a load of downloaded music so while that gets repaired switched to Spotify. Can't fault it as a substitute. Very intuitive. Even talks to multiple WiFi speakers. Pretty top notch so will remain in my back pocket for quite some time.
Happy with my decision to pay for Spotify. I love music and love the suggestions it offers based on my listening habits. Only frustration is when connecting in my car. Despite it being illegal to use your phone Spotify frequently requires interaction on the move. Can be frustrating. Worthy of 5 stars overall though
"Though Apple Music seems to have a bigger song collection than Spotify, the way Spotify suggests similar songs is awesome! Also, I like the variety of playlists and the dark UI. Keep up the good work, Spotify Team!"
"I really love Spotify, now that they've cleared the Warner issue. As I had told earlier, I have kept my promise by upgrading to Premium. Spotify is now really my favorite music app. Now Spotify just has to make minor changes to it's UI, and also maybe bring the Voice Search option to compete with other major music apps. Thanks Spotify!!! üíöüíöüíö Some changes I want in the next updates are : *Voice Search*, *Canvas*, *Serial numbers against songs in chart playlists* etc."
Literally cannot live without this app. Used to use apple music and my iTunes but when I switched to android I discovered spotify quite a few years ago. Can't tell you how good this app is. Way better playlists on this compared to apple music and the process is simple to create your own playlists.
Been using for a few years now. User experience is excellent save for a few quirks - for example finding all songs by an artist via an artist page is difficult. Instead you have to simply search the artist and not select their page. The adaption of suggestions to your tastes and listening habits is impressive (and maybe slightly worrying!). The range and quality of music is incredible. Connectivity options are also great.
"Easy listening , predictive daily mixes bring new sounds to my ears. I use the free version and find 30 minutes of ad free music quite sufficient for my needs."
Love it just to download your music click the top dark right button until turns green(after you click on a playlist) thats how you download your music to.play anytime. Spotify anyway to point this out; didn't know this until 4months later having Spotify lol
"Better in almost every way! Congrats to Spotify for improving on most of its complaints and listening to its customers. Lyrics are back and now on mobile!! Genius is mostly gone (I think) and replaced with 'Storyline', a welcome change. That, combined with ease of use, podcasts, increasingly better playlists and suggestions are distancing Spotify from its competitors. I still think the 'new' Home page could be polished and made smarter, more useful, better designed (it's a bad Tidal ripoff)."
"I have been using spotify for years now and I just love,love it i have made many playlists to suit my mood or if I'm driving etc...i have found no problems with this app even when i do updates i don't listen to the radio but I'm still up with the new music or bands as spotify makes a playlist by your type of music and includes new releases. Keep up the good work spotify."
"Music sounds quality are best, friendly UI easy to use & play music most important things Spotify have different type of options given to enhance the listening music experience. üòç"
"I loved this app a lot. Cool , easy to use. Simple and quickly accessible interface. No bugs. Meaningful features and lots it got in it's positiveness."
"I genuinely don't think I could survive without music, and Spotify is the beat app to listen to music with. So it's definitely worth it."
One of the best music apps out there. Their music playlists are just awesome and UI is great too. Highly recommended music app.
Great APP. Im finding that every 3 or 4 songs in offline mode cause my app player to crash requiring a restart. Ive gone online and it works no problem just with offline mode. Thanks keep up the great work
"Spotify is wonderful ive been using since day one üòç Its the best for offline to play your saved playlists just all your favorite songs still good to play and enjoy, definitely good when you have your mates or family over for dinner or quiet drinks, even to set the mood, i can even enjoy pod cast üòÅ Thanks guys for making lives better for music and pod cast enjoyment a big thumbs up from me and my family üòò"
"It was a bit hard to find my way around at first, the layout is not as intuitive as it could be. It took a while to understand how playlists worked, however, now I'm past those first uneasy steps I genuinely love this app. I have managed to reconnect with so much music that I thought I had lost forever. So, for me this is easily the best music app out there."
"Been using Spotify since 2016, started off with basic and quickly subscried for premium for unlimited downloading. Ive been using it pretty consistently every day since then, love it!"
"Love it, this is a great app. Very intuitive and had a huge selection of great music. I especially like the suggestions and playlists they make."
One of the best music listening experience for me. App UI is so simple and user friendly. Spotify Team try adding more songs to the appüëç
"Great app, has an occasional glitch where you can't get to your music sometimes but it's rare and may require you to delete and reload app. Still giving it 5 stars."
"Works fine, wish artists were in alphabetical order. Also the freezing when the phone goes to sleep is fixed by opening the app and pressing the little circle pause/play button, this seems to then play without stopping but still, you should not have to do that."
"Amazing music and podcast streaming. Very intuitive interface, useful tools like queue and based radios and a cool way of getting to know new material based on your current interest! I recommend it"
"I really like the interface, quite friendly. I only wish it could recommend more playlist with new music, I always end up listening to the same tracks."
"It's amazing iv used it for a few years now. But however a few days ago my SD card started to not keep my songs downloaded and in the ""other"" section where ""storage"" should be. It only shows the log out button. And to get ""storage to pop up I have to take my SD card out then put it back in. Is anyone else having this issue?4"
I like this app a lot. Spotify really is artist oriented. It is an amazing set-up. One of the best go to promo companies is Gilmore Promotions because they deal with all the music vehicles and help to get new campaigns going where the mesh of music with businesses is legendary. This is one of those things where you know youll get good listening always because of whose involved. I discovered Ateam Money Gang Records rap artist LaQuinn using this app and it is because the curator knows my taste.
"I enjoy the user interface... whether I am searching for new music or choosing something feom a different genre... it is intuitive. I also like the ""My Daily Mix"" provided to me based on my listening selections."
Spotify is The best I only use Spotify and YouTube personally I always love the design and how it is so smooth to find what u want to listen to and the variety of music is awesome because Spotify gives a lot of smaller artist love that other online music streaming services don't.
"Amazing app, I barely have a day where I don't use Spotify. From the UI, to the so personalized playlists, to the high quality sound."
"Overall a very good app with an intuitive design but I think that it could be some what faster on my Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus Exynos 9810. I also think that you should redesign the widget and make us be able to make it smaller or bigger. I believe you should add functions to it as repeat and shuffle and also make it have rounded corners. Well as I said, This app is awesome"
The best you ask and you will always get what you're looking for. I don't care if your 12 or 90 you can hear any song you know. Just talk into the Microphone and like feeling stronger every day. Then the song will play and even give you the Artist. You can download all of that bands song's and store them for offline useage and on line. Build your Library of your favorite songs today and NEVER EVER HAVE TO USE your CD's nor records not The sucking Radio again. Have fun and just sing and dance.
The music choice is very good. I really like how easy and fast their customer service is. They were able to help me with my issue quickly and it's not something that most companies can say. Overall this is a great music platform.
"Use it all the time, so useful, so intuitive and easy to use. Only feature I would want is the ability to select multiple playlists at a time when adding a song to playlists, rather than having to add it to one at a time"
"Any issues or bugs, which occur very rarely are fixed very quickly. Great feature how they play a playlist based on what you've just recently been playing. Also how they track where bands are playing live. If you love music then premium is worth it. Its 1 maccas meal every month you can go without."
"I think it's the only app that never crosses my mind to delete or cancel. Music is important in life and this app gives me any music from any country, even audio books, pod casts, etc. It's awesome. Very well executed app, I genuinely love it."
"Great song recommendations and easy to understand features. Does what it says on the tin, with an overall good user experience."
"Spotify is amazing, the best music streaming app you can find on any device or platforms, high quality songs, categories, vast music collection anything you need is on Spotify, I'm so glad of it but I hope they change the UI of app, it's a bit old now and add some new customization features for music player me, best of the best 5/5"
"Fell in love with app and thier devs. Really interesting to see how effectively they designed and developed. Reching all corners, seems the perfect example of digital transformation !! Suggestions to add features like - spotify music stories/news/releases , so that users can follow/read - even though premium is there, put albums/songs for sale for less price. So that users can buy and listen forever in your app. - music learning courses (live, if possible) free/payable from popular gurus."
"excellent wonderful Perfect I just love SPOTIFY don't know what I would do without it!! so very glad I don't have too!!, Its like Ur own Personal Station to all the Best Music Ever by the voice or push of a button at any time MUSIC Just wanted to add Spotify has a wonderful gift to collaborate the music we listen too, eg. MY 2018 Collaboration of the music I listen too was as though I did it myself WHOM EVER YOU ALL ARE I TRUELY TAKE MY HAT OFF TO YOU ALL, MUSIC IS HEALING Thank you SPOTIFY"
"Great, intuitive and easy to use. Plethora of playlists and music selection. Curated playlists are much longer and diverse than Apple music"
The paid version is a straight 5*s all the way. Some of the features that are locked behind the sub can be quite annoying but make the sub totally worth it too.
Very intuitive. All the features of Spotify on a Mac or desktop. Being able to cast to other devices with that have your Spotify account on them is seem less and feels awesome üëç
"Spotify has a great selection of every genre of music, podcasts, and foreign language lessons. I have Spotify on my phone, tablet, and home and work computers. I love that you can create and download your personal playlists for times you don't have access to the internet, such as during a plane flight. If your car has Bluetooth or an auxiliary patch you can access your playlists and avoid the tedious, inane banter of the disc jockey and endless commercial sets"
"The app is awesome, I love the UI of spotify than the competitor, tho not every songs are in spotify. Overall love the experience using this app."
Still absolutely love to use Spotify!! Won't switch to anyone other. No matter what the promotion is. And now I have my husband and 2 sons and my mom and her brother (my uncle) all using Spotify. My uncle really likes it because he is an avid Harley Davidson ridder and enjoys being able to listen to the music that suits him for that particular mood and ride
"I am old enough to recognize this as magic. It's literally awesome to have this much music at my fingertips. It's amazing! So many songs I'd have never otherwise heard. So many obscure albums I've never been able to track down, and they're all right here. And it does an extraordinary job of reccommending new music that suits my tastes. Can't praise it enough. Wholeheartedly encourage you to give it a try."
"I love this app it's awesome! I pay for premium, however I do wish there was a way to quickly add daily mix into a playlist or save particular mixes."
One of the best music application i ever used. I'm 100% sure if you use this app you will delete other music apps. The UI is so easy and clear of this app. All song and artist is in the application. I'm very happy with this application.
"This is definitely the best music app in the world. I am Premium and this is definitely worth it. But what is bad, is that for the free account, you can't do anything. You can't even CHOOSE your song. But beside that, the recommendations algorithm and the features are amazing. Maybe it needs a little UI refresh. It feels old. But again this is still the best music streaming app of the world!"
I love having spotify premium. I'm a delivery driver so I'm always listening to music. If I could give it 4.5 stars I would. Just because they dont have every song available. Like for example the campfire freestyle by juice wrld. I love that song and they dont even have it on there.
Ok before I update it it was amazing I can shuffle my playlist a I want and I enjoyed it. After the update i hate it i can't anymore and i can't even pause my music on my lock screen. And I'm a paid member i feel like I'm being treated as I'm not a paid member. I have to have my music and I enjoy spofity a lot. But please fix what i said and bring back that shuffle button. Until then I'm leaving this as a 2 star. Edit: ok they fix everything I'm happy I continue to love this app
Fantastic site by far the best music app of all by far one thing I would do it give the end user the opportunity to purchase a single or a album directly through the app with spotify currency which we acquire through the same method in which subscription is paid allowing us to put the music on other devices eg. MP3 or flash drive. Allowing spotify to over take Google music and Apple music. Also allow a comment option for us to interact with favorite artists. Hope management see's this post.
"New: I listen to podcasts a lot, why can't I rate them on Spotify interface? As often asked by the person casting. Also, how do I find podcasts that I 'follow' again? It's not intuitive. Old: Thanks for all thr new podcast integration in new releaseüòÅ üëç Older: I use Spotify a lot but have some issues. Why aren't podcasts integrated properly into the app? The downloaded episodes are 'hidden' in the interface. The app should prioritise podcasts 'for me' in all views as i use them a lot."
"I have tried almost all of the popular music streaming services and Spotify is by far the best one with streaming quality, UI, and personalization."
Amazing app you can listen to pretty much everything you want but I really hate that when it says you get a half-hour of uninterrupted listening ten muinets later you gey another add other than that it rocks you can even make youre own personal playlists
The app is quite useful as it helps to be able to listen to songs even while using some other app. A lot of variety of songs are also available.
I'm liking the selection and doesn't quit on me 10 seconds before the end of every song like another music app does to me. Keeps me entertained with minimal interruptions.
"The app not only has your favorite music, but even makes you find and explore new music!! The design of this app is incredible too!! I've loved the app from the beginning"
"YALL ACTUALLY LISTENED TO MY PREVIOUS REVIEW ON UI ACCESSIBILITY, S/O to the development team! It's much easier to notice the songs in the playlist, thank you."
The sound quality of music is wonderful with it's overall features of graphics in spotify is extremely invaluable for an end-user to listen any likeable genre of music.
The interface and presentation of app is quite impressive. I've became a huge fan of it. The connectivity of app with various devices is amazing.
"Greatest streaming app for music ever! All my favourite artists, albums and tracks under the same roof, good stuff! There's one complaint I have with the app, why isn't a search bar for every playlist and liked songs like it is on iOS app? I find it stupid and useless extra steps to find a track. You have to select options button, go to Find and then search. A top bar will make this way more fast and natural!"
"I love Spotify, I think its a great music streaming service that particularly impresses me with its ability to handle bad network connections. Of course better Linux support (particularly for Wayland) is always appreciated, but I can understand that this isn't exactly a priority for the development team ;)"
"It's a good app. You can find the songs you like. The one negative I've found is that you can't download the music into a flashdrive. The download button sends the music to I cloud, therefore you can't listen to it on another player."
"Tons of selection, easy to use, intuitive options, and creative discovery playlists. You can't go wrong with Spotify."
I love it. Nothing more to say. Impressed by their recommendation and eye catching UI. Please include an optional lyrics feature too...
"Great music and access to insane amounts of content from top artists, all that luxury of premium for a great price! - Especially if you're a student only about $4.99 a month for Spotify, Hulu and Showtime Student Bundle ;)"
Perfect but i wish there was a feature where i could make a playlist with a friend that would have all the music we listen to in common. I also would like it if editing playlist was easier and if the queue button wasnt so close to the delete from playlist button.
"My only complaint is that y'all don't have every song in existence, but I don't that's (entirely) y'all's fault. I'm assuming it's up to the artist whether they want their song (or specific ones) on there, or for legal reasons (-slash- requirements that have to be met) it can't be on there. Like the song 'Milk Carton' by Usher. That song is a mother frickin banger.üé§üé∂üëåüèª‚úäüèª I wish it was on Spotify."
"I love this streaming music app. The user interface is great and intuitive. The playlists that come up are much more appealing than what Google Play music recommends. I like that I can use Spotify on my LG TV as well with lyrics if you want to sing a long. Unless Google fixes their family plan before the subscription runs out, I might just make the switch to Spotify's family plan."
Brilliant to find any music anytime to suit your mood at any particular time or reason. So much easier to have everything at your fingertips than searching through piles of CD's! I love Spotify
"Spotify is just the coolest thing ever! There are plenty of entertainment options, the design is visually and mechanically impeccable, the sound quality is superb, and the sharing features are amazing! I have loved Spotify for many years! Spotify is a paragon of music apps and one of the absolute best entertainment apps available. Two thumbs up! Definitely... DEFINITELY bruh..."
"My best app on the phone. It's flawless, reliable and quick. I am in love with Spotify - I use it every day. I highly recommend. They have such an amazing product. I use premium and it worths every penny."
"Out of the hundreds (probably thousands) of songs that I've listened to with this app, I've maybe only not found 2 songs that I was looking for. I use this app every day and definitely reccomend for people to get premium. Playlist making is pretty intuitive, and sharing spotify playlists is easy."
Love Spotify except for the hide button in the notification shade control screen. It's the worst and was very difficult to unhide the song afterwards. Hope you fix/remove it.
"I love Spotify. I enjoy how personalized it is. I think the time capsules and yearly rewinds are really good. Also, the interface itself is very well designed."
"Look, I don't often leave reviews but in the absence of being able to find an easier way to express my displeasure at hiding the repeat/shuffle buttons, I'm leaving this in the hope they'll be brought back to the Now Playing screen. You're a music player; don't make it harder to play music."
"great app I don't listen to the new music but if you like Classic Soul,Rock or Pop it's on spotify also Jazz lovers spotify has it all I Spend hours listening to Miles Davis or more modern artist like Fourplay,Pat Matheny and the late George Duke, you can't beat the price and the audio Quality is Adjustable to suit your streaming limitations. Last thing on the good to know list about spotify it works great with Alexa from Amazon flawlessly for me so far."
"I Have Tried Different Music Apps, Even The Original App On My Huawei, Spotify Beats Em All. EASY To Use, Quick Downloads, Beautiful Set Up And An Amazing Auto Suggestion Feature When Creating New Playlist. It Can Acurately Guess What Songs You Would Like In Your Newly Created Playlist. Amazing Offline & Online. Auto Downloads As Soon As You Get Unto A WiFi Network. Keeps Your Music Updated Constantly For Offline Listening."
"Simply awesome. Ability to auto-add liked songs to ""liked"" playlist is a great functionality & easy way for listeners to build their arsenal of favorite music..."
"Build a playlist of songs you want to hear. There are also pre made song lists that are based off of artist you like. Discover new artists with their discover playlists. Pause, rewind, like, and dislike."
"Can't open menu for songs (the 3 dots in the top right), everytime I try the whole app freezes and crashes. This means I can't add songs to playlists, share songs, etc. I've used spotify premium for years now and do enjoy it, but this bug is making it quite difficult to do much on the app. If this gets fixed I'll change my review to a 5 star."
"This is simply the best app for streaming music all over the world! Simple to use, many features, cool design and nice download and storage technology for offline songs and Playlists! And the Abo price is really acceptable üòä So 10/10 recommended!"
"Other than the live music share feature needing more functionality, this app is amazing with a great range of music and podcasts with a simple design."
"Love the different tunes which go on daily, and the mixer of music is a lot different from other sites and music apps. Ive had this app for quite a while now and i wouldn't change it at all, and if you go premium you get complete AD free. So thats ecen better also saving your music to yoyr own playlist to listen to later couldn't be any easier."
"UI a little confusing, but it just works, always, flawlessly. Music selection is unparalleled, audio quality excellent and resilience to poor signal or flaky coverage is amazing."
"Great app that has the largest library of songs that has its own classifications for your different tastes in music. Also, the music algorithm is calculated to suit your needs."
"EDIT : MY ONLY NIGGLE IS IF U PAY 4 THE PRIVILEGE, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO D/LOAD & KEEP IT 4 OFFLINE & ALWAYS. IF YOU DECIDE TO CANCEL YOU STILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP YR PLAYLISTS INSTEAD OF LOSING EVERYTHING. I think Spotify is awesome, having all that music, podcasts etc at the click of a button & for free aswell. . . I still L‚ô°VE YOU SPOTIFY. ‚ù£‚ù£ üòäüëç‚ù£‚ù£"
"Just got worse, first of all let me say that I loved the old player design so much, apart from being subjective there are some major button swapping/relocation which I believe breaks the habit of users, menu button is now on top which I personally used a lot and which is now hard to reach also it does not feel premium now, feels dibalanced. I hope this review is helpful for spotify and they do something about it."
"Kind of sucks without premium. The free version is on par with Pandora premium and the premium version is like a tech advance we should have waited ten instead of two years for. I'm all for instant gratification and what I want to hear when I want it but the library itself is worth using the web app for, but not quite worth paying the full asking price."
Using the UI is very intuitive. Songs are way easy to find. There are numerous playlist that are well conceived.
I enjoy how this music flows over me. I'd like the user interface design. Especially I like about the marketing strategy that always reminds user to switch to premium. I hope there's a better development day by day.
"Love the app. It has only one problem. When I'm searching, sometimes I see musics which I have already liked them before, but the like button is off. And when I hit it and search the music in liked musics playlist, I see two of the same song."
I can't say enough about Spotify. It is truly the best service out there. From playlist to music design specially for you. Spotify is the best!
"It's the best that's all i can say. Best Audio Quality , best song recommendations. It makes me updated and feels home to use it. Maybe it needs some UI and theme changes , but it deserve a 5 star"
Excellent music & podcast catalog. Spotify always care about my preferences with customized playlists and the personalized anual and decade review are awesome. Excellent user experience. Keep it up spotify
"In terms of UI and UX, this is one of the best music player i have encountered. Also, playback support is awesome. Keep it up!"
"I have been using this app for years. I have never even switched to another music app because this app works so smoothly and well. I do have a family plan with premuim, but overall, this is one of my favorite apps on my phone."
I love this app so much. I can to listen to most songs I want to. I do wish i could have unlimited skips without going to premuiam. Its so much easier to find a song.
"I had iHeart for quiet some time and I hated, tried Pandora couldn't get used to the way it worked. I got Spotify premium as a gift from Microsoft and they now have me hooked. Won't go back to any other music app. Highly recommend."
"Spotify is a good way to explore different music genres,it is quite easy to find songs and recommends things you like! I really enjoyed using Spotify and I even might get premium!!!"
"The greatest music/podcast platform. So easy to load and play your favorites right away. Loved the Dirty John podcast, found many more fun stories, Dramas, Mysteries. Discovered Kev Rowe acoustic guitar touched a hurting part of me to encourage healing. Try it you'll love it!"
It's a pretty amazing place. Nearly limitless supply of music accompanied by a good UI and tons of features to make listening to music and finding new pieces a fun experience. I Definitely recommend this for anyone that enjoys music.
"Whilst they should have a discount for high school students as well, Spotify is a pretty amazing app. Their entire music library has just about anything you are looking for and more. Though it would be cool if it had a built-in Shazam/song identifier."
"Wide library, excellent quality, the UX on mobile is a bit strange but you can get used to it. Spotify Connect is a godsend that I use more than I could think of. Great price and optional drops for eligible users so that's a bonus (even though I think they should do it on more countries). All in all a great experience"
"excellent selection of music and great user experience couldn't recommend it any higher, this is coming from my previous Apple music and Google play music subscriber. Just get Spotify, it's worth it!"
"Great app, but the lack of a power button made me delete once, hope it's fixed soon as I dont want another app being left on in the back ground. But, as a music app, you cant do any better, and I tried them all."
Can you add a dedicated button to add the song to a playlist please? And not having to click on the dots and then on the option to add the song to a playlist. Deezer has this option and it is a lifesaver when driving and not only when driving. Thanks.
Much better. Still disappointed with the missing songs. But not disappointed enough to leave the platform. Just going to keep fingers crossed and hope the lawsuits blow over.
"I have never had such an extensive repetoire of music immediately available to me and I will not even go into the smoothness of the layout and interface. The design is elegant and intuitive, there is very little Spotify could do to ruin this experience but I'll not tempt you."
The best thing about the app is the inbuilt software and it's interface. It automatically (~97%) displays the next song according to your present song selection and your mood. Loving this app
"Nice app use it all the time. Great podcasts and songs to listen to at like anytime. All types of genres and things to listen to 10/10 would recommend. However, ads are quite annoying but you can remove them with premium but you can still listen the ads are just really annoying."
"I love that you can look up any song and add it to ur playlist. And when you search for a song in specific, it'll play it twice and move on to a playlist that suites that song. My playlist? 3000+ and counting."
"Very good and user friendly, love to bits. I can recommend it to a friend. On the move and anyway else, you get it. New,old, classics, hip-hop,rave, rock'n'roll, house music , you get it all. in ordinary rating, I would give Spotify, out of a hundred,( a massive one hundred and a fifty). Ask those with the know how, they will upgrade your naive mind quickly. As for the ignorant, they are missing the bus to Milwaukee, so catch it while still early..I've got some friends that just changed, love it"
I love the sound quality and the ease of use. It is very intuitive and has a friendly way of assisting me with downloading songs I enjoy. Thanks for my new friend. Jack
"Best music app out there; gives the best suggestions for similar songs in a playlist, smooth user interface, and awesome design overall. Highly recommend for all music lovers."
"Great overall (Have Premium), I've used Amazon music, apple music, I heart radio, pandora, and Google music but I prefer the UI and music recommendations fron Spotify. I also really enjoy when they do end of year recaps and create other playlists for me. Highly recommend."
"The best music app out with premium. (I've tried apple music) More of my friends have spotify so we can easily share new music. Good UI, convenient and you can safely use while driving."
"Well, this is the ultimate streaming experience.. the UI is fluid and pleasant.. even if you use another music app for sometime, you will eventually come back as Spotify is simply phenomenal.."
"What I like: virtually ever song I could possibly think of is available, easy-to-use interface, playlist and library features a few different ways to sort songs. - - - What could be improved: Song search function for all playlists and not just for Liked songs. Large playlists do take quite a bit of scrolling!"
Quite simply the best music streaming app out there. I hope Spotify takes over the world. Great for the independent musician too. Never change; we love you.
"What Would My Life Be Without You? I honestly love Spotify so much. I have had it since the beginning and remember coming across it. I had to switch to Premium because I found myself craving the freedom to listen to Playlists I have made, WHENEVER. The music and podcast selection is excellent. It has never failed me, and I genuinely don't know what I would do without it. The sound is good. I like that you can follow your favourite Artists. I just love it."
Easy to install. Very intuitive interface. Easy to find songs. Considering switching to premium.
I love you spotify and I want to take this relationship to the next level. So let me see that discography and let's make a playlist. But seriously spotify is a great app with premuim. Spread the sound and support their platform.
I was offered a free music service by my wireless carrier and took a break from Spotify. I'm back to Spotify now. It's so intuitive and easy to use. I enjoy the podcasts too. Even transferring my Spotify lists and songs didn't make the other music app better.
Way to many ads but still a pretty good place to stream music and podcast. I find myself using spotify quite often. I was going to give it 4 starts but I just rembered spotify finally made it so you can add the same song mutiple times to the same playlist. Youtube should take a good look at spotify and let you add the same video mutiple times to the same playlist to
Dude. Hands down the best. Screw all the other music apps. Spotify 1000% genuinely cares about their listeners. Everything is so personalized and they even give you new artists/songs to check out based on your listening weekly. In a perfect world everyone would be on Spotify.
"... Everyday they give you a list of ppl of personally suited playlists to choose from, depending on your preferred music genres and artists!! I also love the Spotify app, because it allows for the use of multiple screens at one time, making it easier for completing work related tasks, or just chillin gaming 'n still kickin it üé∂ to the beats! Thanx guys! üëå ~ Bonnie Lynn"
"Affordable, hardly ever crashes desipe how many people use Spotify, easy and quick to download and look up music. Highly recommend."
"Super simple UI, high quality playback. Some occasional buffering issues but other than that it's been great for the 5 years I've used spotify."
"I absolutely love Spotify, it's cool, I'll listen to a few artist or songs and next thing you know the wonderful people at spotify build a bunch of play lists for me, it's like having a built in DJ in my phone. Thanks Spotify, best music app there is."
Just switched from Pandora about an hour ago and after transferring all my playlists I'm way happier with this already. UI is much cleaner and simpler to use plus the music selection is way better with more uncensored music. Pandora has been replacing songs with the clean versions even in your thumbs up.
"Okay, so, so far, up to this point, spotify has been amazing. But now all of a sudden, I can't get into my account. Usually, when I opened spotify, it would go straight to the main page without me needing to log in. But now, when I open spotify, it requires me to log in, but I forgot my password and my username, and when I type in my email address to get my password, it says it's invalid. Please help me with this."
I've had this app for years and it has never given me any issues. I love how I can just hear a song on the radio and go look it up on spotify and find the album and artist and others that I completely forgot about. Or I can just pick something recommended to suit my mood best app to me. I wish it did show lyrics although I mainly use the free version
"Always find something good to listen to. Music, podcasts- very good selection. And good user experience with the app."
"Brilliant as long as you have Spotify premium membership, but it's worth the money. Spotify recommends songs with complete accuracy, and I have discovered some of my favourite artists through Spotify. Its user interface is incredibly simple with premium, although it is quite difficult to navigate the app without premium. Spotify does its absolute best to make your life easier with discovering and listening to music and even navigating music in your car is a breeze with their car view mode. 5/5."
"Spotify is better than Apple music, that's what they want you to hear at least. I don't have that many characters here but believe you me when I say Spotify is leading the music streaming industry, upheld mainly by their UI, which is easy to use and has a way of suggesting songs that I like."
"Great app! I enjoy listening to music whatever, whenever, wherever I want! specially if you will avail premium account, it's worth what you pay even if its only for 3 months for only 150 pesos. I will definitely avail again the premium account once it ends up. Highly recommended app. I enjoy my work as a home based graphic designer while listening to Spotify with my favorite songs that I want to play. name it and it is all available in a search engine if you avail premium account. thumbs-up!"
The only complaint I have with Spotify is they have limited old bollywood movie songs. This makes me jump to YouTube but I don't like YouTube music because of their UI. Otherwise best music app.
"After first time I used Spotify I never wanted to use anything else. AI algorythms are brilliant, the app has obviously undergone a proper UI/UIX research, and even the absence of some (very little) amount of songs doesn't spoil it. At home, in the car, in a trip, on a walk -- it is simply perfect."
"I love Spotify! I don't know what i would do with out them. Somethings I wish they'd add: light theme, lyrics, and idk really just a better ui. But anyways it's still a super awesome app."
my favorite music app. however its crashing after a few songs when I'm playing music and it's quite annoying. have to reopen and press play.
The app is great and comes with great genres of music .The daily mix feature is also great and fabulous.The app design seems to have much materialistic design which is great and the detailings in the app doesn't look puny.
I love the collection of songs and overall use is good too..one of the best feature(though small) was able to control the volume within the app since i prefer a minimal use of the physical buttons..
"Great selection of music best I've seen and ease of use is exceptional. Recommends songs that are awesome helps build my playlist, offline capability is all the difference"
Free version is ok but the paid for service is very good. Huge selection of music and the app is intuitive to use.
I love Spotify. We are premium. Good customer service with quick response. All music choices. I can't live without Spotify premium.
I loved my premium Spotify until it kept stopping and nothing helped. I'm back to free listening. I'm not quite sure which is worse. I need music therefore I am going to try other apps. I'll keep checking back to see if anything is going well again... I'm back.
"Really good playback, clear audio, easy to use. Great way to listen to music and a quick way to click on songs! üòä"
"Excellent selection, fabulously easy to use. Fast results, completely ingenious functions and tools to use to get to the music that suits the moment or project you need. Enjoy!"
"My experience with the app is delightful so far, and perfectly suits my needs. My one caveat with the service is some underground or specific bands that I really like is not available or not in this service (for instance, I really like the metal band Demetori but they aren't here). I guess it depends with the bands' publishers."
"I subscribed immediately! The best collection of music I love, beautiful mixes and playlists personaly designed based on my choice, clear sound - perfectly balanced for each song. Love it more than any other music app. Thank you for creating such app and filling my day with music‚ù§ Love this app more every day - all the music which I love, all music which I shall listen. Thank you Spotify Team for rising love vibesüòç"
AMAZING customer support! When my account got accessed by an unauthorized user they were able to recover my playlists AND helped refund the charges. They were quick to respond and so good about working out the issues. The only way I survive my long commute is spotify downloads so I am happy to continue using this app.
"I have always been in love with Spotify even before it launched here in India. The playlists, the UI, the sheer experience of using it and the added perks of being a Premium member makes it unparalleled. Just hope that the issue with Warner Bros is resolved in the near future so that all the songs get available once again. Regardless, Spotify, I love you ‚ù£Ô∏è"
I've been with Spotify for about 5 years now ever since Pandora didn't quite satisfy my need for music. I signed up and never looked back. Love this app! One thing I would recommend is to put a timer on. I'd like to go to sleep listening to Spotify but I don't want my phone on all night. Hope you can get this going on the next update.
"Been using it for years and it's great. Only irritating thing is having to manually clear the cache and occasionally reinstall to stop it taking up so much space. But if I do that it plays nice with my phone memory. Love everything else about it, so many great features for discovering music! Genuinely enhances my life. 5* from me!"
"Love it , its more customizable than Pandora. Also, you can build your favorites in different genres much faster. Long time Pandora user who tried Spotify and switched."
"OMG what do I say about Spotify? It's the best music app I've ever used. I've been through some doubts about using it time and again but ever since it came out in India I've installed it quickly. What I thought the best feature is the My Top Songs List, The My Repeat List and My Repeat Rewind list. I felt so good to find my music cherished and remembered and given back to me in the form of a gift that were those amazing Playlists. I hope the Spotify keeps surprising me provides peace like always"
"Has put music back into my life! As technology changed I grew tired of updating equipment, and eventually succumbed to whatever was on the radio. Now I get to choose again, but with infinitely more options."
"I have had Spotify for several years now. I push my Spotify button more than any other. I am quite codependent now and I'd like to leave it's a healthy codependency :) all the available songs\ from all the different genres past present and future. I eagerly anticipate spending the rest of my days with you in my life;Spotify never ever ever leave me ,"
Great music and easy interface. I love the modern design and color scheme just upgraded to premium and it is worth every penny!
"I really enjoy Spotify overall, It is much better than Pandora my opinion because I can select one artist and I can pass over songs quickly... It is a much more efficient program...‚òò"
It's amazing it's easy to find music you want and build a playlist from that. The only down side is if you dony have premium theres just alot of adds but even with them it's still an enjoyable app
"I love this app!! I drive a lot and listen to music and podcasts. I came a cross a problem with the app. I brought it to their attention. They were quick, attentive, and helpful! Thank you"
"Absolutely loving this app. I can find here any music I feel like listening to. The app creates playlists based on my choices, which is great for introducing me to different artists. There is also many great mood playlists to chose from. Also it is getting better for podcasts, there is quite a choice of different themes. Loving also the download option to save the battery and data on long drives"
"Spotify's musical inventory is truly vast. Pick any song or or musical piece, and Spotify probably has it. But all the ways that music is curated to help you find music you like is quite impressive."
"Love the app so much, can play any music I can dream of.. Only one suggestion, I wish that I could pull down in my playlist to search for a specific song instead of going through a menu and finding the ""search in playlist button"". Find any song quick and easy would be amazing."
"I absolutely love that I can building a complete library with playlists & sounds that compliment my everyday, different moods. So much awesome music! Thank you, Spotify!"
"I use exclusively Spotify for my music, done so for the last 2 years with no complaints. Today i discovered the removal of the widget from my home screen. It was my main tool for song management, and a convenient one. it's removal is a spit in our face, which shows the company's complete disregard for user experience. I really hope they will rethink it, or sadly many of us will have to unsubscribe. ***Update*** So the community outcry helped, the widget is back"
"I have never purchased a single app . Spotify had a promotion of giving away free Google home mini , so my friend subscribed for premium just for that but then never went back, he loved it and said ""it's just magical I dont want to leave this u sud try"" I was like I'm never going to give money for music which can be found for free on YT. But everything changed , this month spotify was giving 3 month free trial and I thought to give it a shot. Such great app with friendly ui awa fast download"
"I have been using Spotify since 2016 and haven't seen any other music provider to have such variety of songs and playlists with an incredible UI. The main highlight of Spotify is it's loyal fanbase and now they have plans for students as which is such an incredible move, especially in countries like India. Talking about India, somehow they have managed to keep the prominent languages songs in their library which is awesome and shows that it has something to offer to everyone."
"Super cost effective access to a huge library, reliable, integrates into Google home, best UI, and the download music feature saves me Soo much data. Love it!"
"Great one stop shop for all my music, podcasts, and guided meditation playlists! Couldn't be happier with it's interface, and don't hate having my pre-existing Hulu account included in my subscription price now saving me $5/month!"
An amazing app for listening to your music. Managing playlists is really easy with Spotify and the music library in Spotify is huge. I like it's ease of use. Connecting it with Chromecast is also very easy. It is a genuinely nice app for listening to music. Cannot ask for more.
"Inutuituve, works on nearly any device, great interconnectivity. Hands down, the best music app out there. Spotify and its premium services are a must have."
"Terrific variety of music choices and the automatic groupings of songs on playlists was amazing. When picking artists, I liked many of the additional suggestions that popped-up for similar artists and music. I quickly created a huge selection of my favorite music that I enjoy hearing."
"Aside from the UI constantly changing and random pauses/glitches during podcast playback (which drives me insane when I can't constantly be touching my phone to fix it, but I'm dealing with it), it's a good app with access to plenty of content for a relatively cheap price."
"App is great. I use it quite a bit so I got a premium account. Well worth it. The algorithm for finding music, based on your liked songs is simple and effecient!"
Hey!!!!!!! Honestly I am just finding out about spotify and the new respectable way to have new music on the phone and its soo easy and my God.... listen to this Your magic algorithms have been suggesting songs I used to listen to allll day and cruise Anywho the 3 month promo is absolutely a good deal ... And only 10$ A MONTH after lol Please never change anything on your app Its amazing
This is the best music service other than YouTube Music that I have seen. The UI is top-notch on my Galaxy. I have one question about skipping songs though. Why am I only allowed to skip 6 songs an hour on my Saumsung A10e but I can skip double the songs on my Playstation or my PC.
This is an excellent app and easy to get started with. It is intuitive and introduces me to more similar music or podcasts that I like.
I had this application before but since I got another phone I added this app again. I love listening to music that I like. Great job. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!! I just listen to the Free music and it suits me just fine. I can listen to music from ALL Generations & I like this.
"Amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è Its been my favourite music app since so many years. The database is unlike any other streaming service. From Indie artists to newly released songs, it had everything you could want. My only complaint is that the UI seems outdated and needs a refresh, but apart from that, it's the absolute bestüôå‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Haven't tested them all, but Spotify is pretty righteous y'all. Smooth intuitive app, great mixes and the selection hasn't disappointed yet. Wu-Tang Shame on a Ninja! ü§òüèª"
I love the Spotify app you have all the music in the world right at your fingertips easy to use allows you to download music to play offline make your favorite playlist. Easy to navigate through the app love the graphics the layout well worth it download it now you won't regret it whatever type of music you like Spotify has it.
"I find Spotify very useful and very well designed. I love the features and love all of the Playlists I can make. So overall, it's a good music app in my opinion. 10/10"
"Best music app/subscription I've had. Responsive, intuitive interface, easy plans, and a great selection of music."
It's totally perfect for me not gonna lie even the free users enjoy the app as much as the premium guys for me I'm all into music and I'm like always in this app Good UI Good song selections and playlists Perfect music streaming app for me.
Everything I have ever wanted to listen to has been and is at my fingertips. Always ready and waiting. Quickly found. And even suggestions made by Spotify have been and are very much welcome. Even though my tastes are diverse and cover many categories and generations there has never been any delay in gaining access. Thank you Spotify for making my listening experience memorable and first class.
My to go to. I love that it makes mix of music I will actually like and want to press the like button on. Spotify is a one stop shop for all music and entertainment lovers.
The app is great and very easy to use. I did have some issues logging in beacuse i couldnt remember the email and password i used and i needed to cancel my premuim. I contacted Spotify and they promptly got back to me and resolved the issue. I was amazed at how fast they got back to me. Kuddos to you Spoitify!!
"Love that they have an offline mode. The UX is nice, the recommendation engine is impressive and there's nothing frustrating about it. Great app overall."
"Fantastic, but not if you don't want to pay. I have the family plan [I was previously paying 99 cents for 3 months] that my sister pays for and if we continue this cycle, I might pitch in every now and then. It's worth it though. I genuinely enjoy using this app."
"I've come from google play music to this and its just sooo much better in terms of UI, sound quality, selection, and recommendation. SPOT-on."
"I do enjoy this application, the sound quality is superior, started to really enjoy my Yamaha a/v system that is having spotify built in, the synchorization between the different devices started to get much better as well, I just keep discovering and jumping between different albums, artists, go to song radio, and the suggested weekly discover through the app is just amazing, just hope spotify won't be missing any song or performance that might be available on different platform."
The most convenient and featured music app I have ever used. The UI is good and hoping that the dark theme remains the same. The equalizer is a boon. The convenience here is that you can pay 13 rupees to get premium for a day. I REQUEST SPOTIFY NOT TO REMOVE THIS AS 13 RUPEES FOR A DAY IS A VERY GOOD DEAL!
"Overall a great experience, but the buttons aren't really intuitive and you just have to learn where to press (coming from normal Android music player). Otherwise perfect."
"Best music streaming service, hands down. It builds playlists based on the music you've played and updates the playlists daily. The playlists are sorted by genre which is great."
"I love spotify! Ive been paying for premium for about a year now and dont know how i lived without it üòÄ‚ù§Ô∏è not only can you listen to your favourite music, i've also discovered probably close to a hundred more artists that i love and would have had no idea they existed without Spotify. Being able to download and listen to your favourite tunes without using your data in seconds is lux, i would highly recommend paying for premium you might not think you need it but...you do , thank you Spotify!!"
"Works well, as a premium user never had a problem with it and believe it's well worth purchasing a subscription, loads songs quickly even when data or wifi is weak(for me at least) 20/10 would recommend"
"I like the way the font is used in the app and the UI is absolutely stunning. I will never uninstall the app, until the font or UI is changed. For the visual experience, this is probably the best music app available in the market, IMHO."
I have only ever had 1 issue in the almost 2 years I've had Spotify and it was resolved extremely quickly with no hassle. Would say it is definitely worth getting premium as I use the app on a daily basis for multiple hours of listening.
"At first I was skeptical, but Spotify quickly became my go to source for music listening and discovery. Can't recommend it enough!"
"Best music app, no contest. Great UI, sleek and beautiful, lots of customization options, and last but not least, amazing customer service!! Definitely recommended. 5/5"
The best and extensive collection of Baroque and Western Classics. Can't start my day without my Allegro playlist on Spotify. So are the audio quality and user experience üëèüëèüëè
"Spotify is just great. It needs a little learning curve with the UI/UX, but once you get it, it is great."
Always used it. Tried a few other apps but they aren't as fluid and nice as spotify. Plus the dark background is great for at night.
"The BEST of THE BEST!!! I cannot rate this high enough! I use this app day & night, night & day. Its affordable, MUCH cheaper than my iTunes bill each month when I was an exclusive iOs junkie. I still have/use my iOs devices but find myself switching quickly back to my android/Spotify relationship. High quality, huge range of artists, fantastic playlists & suggestions, amazing new talents to discover. I loveloveLOVE my Spotify & I can't see it changing, especially when they consistently ROCK!"
"Ok,this one is the best working one so far. Haven't encountered any glitches(yet). Please don't modify anything on this app to the point it's unusable again. Podcasts finally downloading,songs finally not automatically deletes and downloads itself again. Not much changed from last version UI,but the UX is definitely improved. Now I don't mind spending $10 a month for an excellent music streaming service that's actually working :)"
"Spotify has become my most used and favourite app! It's incredibly simple to use, but it has a lot of features built in. Definately gonna tell my friends about this app (they probably already know about Spotify)."
i have been using spotify every day for years and have never had a problem with it. the ui is very functional and i love the customizability of the eq. thank you spotify
Love this app!! It has great daily mixes that they make for your specific preferences. It goes 30 minutes straight. Then you see 1 quick 10 second video. Then 30 more minutes. I can deal with that!! Very easy to use and simple to navigate‚Ä¶
"This app has been the best I've had as of yet through great network and playlists I can alter to only play my favorites from and leave out the artists I dont prefer. Through clear selection guides and laymen features i like, it's of great clarity for users and listeners that can alter list at all times."
I love spotify its great at the gym or at school or at home or on the bus or just anywhere you want to listen to your music! It leads quicker than you tube thank God ü§£üòÇ totally recommended if you want to listen to music where you can actually turn your phone off so you can keep doing whatever it is your doing
"I couldn't get through some of the jobs without have some good music to listen to, love the playlists that get built for me, couldn't be more fitting and some of the artist I never would have listened to ended up actually liking and all thanks to you guys. Keep up the good work. ‚è≠Ô∏è‚è©‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚è™‚èÆÔ∏èüîäüéµüé∂üá∫üá∏"
"Spotify has the whatever I want to listen to. Whether I am in an easy acoustic guitar or Jazz to Heavy Metal, Classical or Rock mood, Spotify has it at my finger tips or Google Home App."
I am a premium user and I am really enjoying the service. One of the best app which creates recommendation based on your listening. Tried all the other music app but this is the best. Smooth UI and no lag.
Can't find my downloads. When my data is off or not connected to WiFi. I only find album's that are not downloaded in my library. And I have subscribed for primuim.
"Works flawlessly on both platforms. Sound quality is excellent but changeable for those who are kinda strict on mobile data at the end of the month. Suggestion algorithms work like a charm. Lastly, the UI is sleek, modern and flat with a plethora of colors."
"Its been fantastic so far, I can find all the quick releases and other songs. Although I would like them to include more varieties too."
its a good app the only problem i have is sometime while im playing a song i would lag then the app would crash and i would have to replay it again and sometimes for example when i play kendrick lamar humble the next song i play it would not play automayically i would have to hit play button can they please fix them if they can
"Great selection, quick downloads, only drawback that I have is after selecting a song from a search, the menu returns to ""recommendations"". I have to re-search to find the previous menu. It may just b me not knowing how to properly use. Overall great!"
Simply the best Music Streaming Platform. Spotify has an amazing user experience due to its beautiful interface and fluid navigation. The streaming is really smooth. And its super amazing that you can play music and control it on and through various devices. The playlists are carefully crafted for every mood. Great job Spotify Team. Its super fun and addictive to use. Kudos to the UI Designers as well.
"Didn't expect the high quality of sound, easy to use and works super great with your Xbox. There's like a slider but you just have to press a button to open and you can adjust the split on the volume between game volume and Music volume without even pausing the game"
Really good. The Indian version still doesn't have certain songs and artists but overall it makes music on the go very very convenient. And I love the design and UI.
"Love love love Spotify. Ability to follow playlists, download for offline use, collaborate with friends on playlists, share playlists/songs outside of the app, and the incredible ""built for you"" playlists Spotify puts together based on songs/ genres you like! Can't say enough about Spotify. Would be lost without it."
Best music app there is by far. They create playlists suited to you. Couldn't ask for a better music experience.
"The best music and podcast app for your daily musical needs or your daily dose of podcasts. You can find almost every song and podcast you know of here. Global and local collections, complete. You can use it for free, unlike Apple Music. This app is also the music streaming app with the best integrations with third party apps, voice assistants, and even cars. I highly recommend for all kinds of music listeners, from kids to adults. This app is easy to use and straightforward, no hassle in the UX"
Excellent. I read all the complaints some people posted on here. But they're forgetting one big thing. IT'S FREE QUIT WHINNING!! Well worth the monthly charge. Way better than iHeartRadio. Taking advantage of the 90 day free trial. Only reason I stayed with iHeartRadio is because Ron Burgundy was on there. Come to find out he's on Spotify also. Love Spotify.
"This is the best app for listening to music even without a subscription,yes there is an ad every 5 or 6 songs but that is bearable.Also the sound quality is good and a large collection of songs is available.Edit-Please keep the place for the repeat button constant,i have blocked many times the song i want to listen on repeat."
"couldn't live without it now. fantastic. if I change my mood, I can change my music to suit, without purchasing a whole album of which you may only like a few tracks. love it ."
"Song recommendations are very good. Application UI is friendly. Song quality is also very nice. Overall, this application is best for music lover's."
"Spotify is hands down the best music streaming service. Excellent music selection, great user experience, and easy to use on multiple devices."
"I like Spotify. It's fairly cheap, and manages the task of organizing my music quite well. Their playlist suggestions are helpful when looking for new music."
I do love the extensive assortment of categories. It's still so overwhelming as I'm jumping around all over the place trying to listen to everything quickly as if it's all going to disappear in the next few minutes! I've never experienced such a feeling of exhilaration! Do try.... Gillian(a new user of the internet & what it has to offer)
"The only thing I don't like is that some songs get removed occasionally. Other than that, it's really nice to use. The fact that you can still make your own playlists, even if you just have the free version, is really nice. Plus, premium gives me a bunch of features and benefits that are nice and I use them all quite frequently. Overall, this is my favorite music service."
"Just love Spotify............lot of music apps just get money by premiums and provide nothing......Spotify has...infact every song that i can listen free.......With simple and attractive interface, lot of songs, user friendly UI......spotify is the best music app on the charts!"
"Spotify is one of the best music apps that you would find on play. The music quality is quite good and there is an option to make your own playlists. Along with that there are many other playlists based on different occasions. The premium version is very expensive and without that you'd have to tolerate advertisements in between and you won't be able to download music and save it in offline mode. Overall, it's quite better than the others for sure."
"This app is just sensational. It has such a great design, easy to deal with, and the premium version offers an offline mode that is perfect for listening to music anywhere at anytime."
"Ok so I might have a different experience since I have a premium subscription but this is just the most convenient, all platform-friendly, and well designed music app."
"It is easy to use, you can download songs to listen to offline and I like their intuitive play lists. It is the music app I have used the most. And I have used them all. It is hands down better than Google Music, iTunes or Tidal."
Best f****ng app for music. But iOS version is so much better. More intuitive to work with (queue slide function etc.). Why am i not able to swipe down for search? Make it better please. Make the change happen
Keeps switching storage from SD to Internal after One UI update on Samsung. Deleting all downloaded files. Storage permissions on as well. Latest update absolutely trashed performance. Back to Tidal
spotify ruined their ui . i can no longer sort my playlists to show up in the order i have put them in originally in my desktop app. theyve taken away the sorting option for ordering all your playlists in overall view of all playlists at once..you can still re order songs within rhe playlists but not the playlists themselves.
"Just a great source of music that learns and find music that might or is your preference. The different in looking at genre and music listening so that it builds the proper channel so you can enjoy, specific or expanded song selection. I left Pandora to try this and never looked back. I have been tempted, by YouTube music."
"Exceptional!!!!!!!! I am quick to reccomend Spotify to all that ask, no ads, flawless playlists as long as you remember to download to your device.....lolol forgot it a time or two & no music unless I had WiFi"
"Although one cannot expect every obscure artist to be here, they have an impressively large library, great UI. I'd die without this app. Perfect 5/7"
Makes listening to music simple. The design is nice and sleek. Easy to navigate app and it has a large selection of songs to choose from.
"Better! Had Tunein Radio for quite a few years, my go-for podasts, and occasional music. Lately, get a lot of ""cannot decode stream"" messages and has become very frustrating. This app I don't experience that, or constant buffering. Thanks for a better alternative."
It honestly surpasses all of the other music streaming apps with its easy to use software but also up to date designs and music. And also for a VERY low price!!!
The best music app you'll ever need! The app learns your music taste and generates great music suggestions accordingly. Great user experience and design as well.
"Keep Netflix, prime and Deezer this is the ultimate streaming service. I listen to this app through most of the day wether in my car, at the office or at home. The algorithm which builds playlists and ""radio"" playlists is fabulous and the quality of sound is top notch. The best streaming service and app bar none!"
"Love it! I can easily search for podcasts, music & more. Intuitive interface. Steady streaming. I have the free version (what can I say, I'm poor!) but haven't found ads to be bothersome. My favorite app~"
"This is a very intuitive and intelligent app it has a very diverse and extensive music library so can easily become very addictive, be careful how you use it, it's that good!"
"Spotify us a very impressive streaming service the music is literally at your fingertips. I love the ability to curate your own playlist and share them, the only thing I wish they would implement in the future is to develop a more social feature in the built in app that makes sharing playlist easier"
"I faced some issues with login, but it was resolved very quickly! The support team is amazing, a shout-out to them! The app in itself is beautiful, the playlists they suggested are the freaking best of all time! Probably the best music streaming appüíØüíØ"
"Excellent choice and range. Works well with car audio, if not a little quiet. Mixing option good for short breaks between tracks"
"Thank you for listening to your user base. The return of the Android widget puts you back at 5 Stars. I love how all of the Android devices throughout my house will show my what is playing and allow me to manage how it is playing. Combined with Google Chromecast Audio (Damn you for discontinuing them Google), I have created my dream music listening scenario. I have some type of Android device (sometimes just my phone) located in every room of my house. I have a variety of speakers in every room. Google Home allows me to combine all of the speakers into a group. Spotify will play to that group. Whole House music for cheap that I can control in each room."
Absolutely fantastic great selection of music every song I have searched for has only been a click away a quick add gives you 30 mins of uniterupted music 5 stars if this rating went to 10 it would be a ten star rating thanks guys brilliant software.
"(Edit: They added the widget, fixed the homescreen, so bumped it up to 5*.) Was great, but an update messed up the play and skip buttons that pops up on the lock screen where it doesn't work and I have to open up the app. They also got rid of the widgets for the app making it a necessity to open the app to change anything. It's still a great service with good quality and many selections of songs, along with great directed recommendations at times, but now average."
"I rarely review anything on here, in fact I'm not sure I ever have, but, wow. Spotify is the single most revolutionary product to happen to legal music since the cassette tape. Never in the history of the human experience have we been able to instantly play the majority of popular music ever recorded. This is a luxury that was not even known to the wealthiest audiophiles or music execs. And now for less than the price of eating out once each month, anyone can have unlimited streaming! Bravo."
"I have been using Spotify for a few months now and I am very pleased by it. I think that it's worth getting the premium. The subscription price is really fair for where I live (‚Ç¨5), though it is more expensive in other places. The free version is quite limiting (no offline and limited skips)."
"Building my play lists with songs I want to hear is easy. Can build by theme or my mood (fast, slow, rock, etc) No skips or interruptions asking am I still listening. Wonderful selection of songs!"
I give this app a five cause it sanding but there is still time for improvement!. Like having a consistent button that takes you back to the playlist you're currently hearing/on.
"- Good support for quick switching between multiple devices. - Playlists, playlist folders, and playlist order in the menu can be manually set on the desktop client, but not on mobile. - Great selection for podcasts in the app. - Fewer audio playback issues when compared to other music streaming services. - Homescreen Widget and playlist shortcuts make playing music quick and easy. - Great integration with Shazam. - Responsive and easy to use."
"Over all amazing app, great UI and is easy to use. The only problem ive found is that when i go to download songs it says its downloading but never does."
"Great app. I decided to pay for no commercials after about 6 months at $9 99. It was a good decision. Hubby jumped on board a few months ago. We now pay $14.99 a month and we each have our own home page and can listen to what we like 24/7. Customized lists are easy to build it takes a bit of time at first. I am still adding to mine. I now listen to podcasts, who'd of thunk. All in all a good value for the money. Beats the radio while traveling too, everytime."
"The BEST music streaming service!!! Very convenient,user friendly,intuitive interface, billions of content of every existing genre."
Some of the foreign song are incomplete but its quite nice for not having to much music to be downloaded as it costing to much space on the phone. Overall its good
Spotify has changed my life and I may soon come to find that I owe all of my success in life to Spotify. My career was essentially ruined but Spotify provided hope and has a high likelyhood of success for me. Thank you to all those involved with making Spotify happen. -Preston Hudman
"Only music app I listen to & having Premium is well worth it! Love that I can say playlist, create my own playlist and am able to download songs for offline use (tho it does eat up a mega amount of my internal storage - iPhone unfortunately does not offer the hardware that is needed for additional external storage nor are they designed to house such thing....ie - SD cards/micro cards/etc....so Apple get with the program please!!!!) So it would be nice if the songs didn't eat up so much storage!"
"It plays music, so it works. 10 outa 10. Also the customer service for fixing any problems with app respond quickly and are highly knowledgeable!"
"Works reliably, deals with connection issues generally better than other streaming apps I use. Controls might be slightly more intuitive. I like the integration, like communication between players on other devices, which does not always work 100% but is still a nice feature. Spotify's recommendation algorithm works very well for me. Edit: Widget is back after many users complained and/or rage-quit. Thanks for listening, Spotify."
"Best music streaming service hand's down. The only complaint I have is the fact that I just tried Spotify for the first time like a month ago, after a decade of Slacker & Pandora. Basically the free version of Spotify is equivelent to slacker plus. They also offer a full 3 month trial subscription, which is the longest trial offered by any streaming service. Mention that you're a Spotify subscriber in your Tinder profile, & watch how crackin' our inbox get's."
I have been using Spotify for quiet a while and i am impressed. It is very different from other music apps and i really seem to enjoy it . Great job.......
"I have been using Spotify for almost three years now and I must say it has been awesome .. At one point there was a hiccup with my premium account due to an issue out of my control, but it was fixed quickly. I love it!"
"No stones left unturned! Most awesome and intresting music app you will ever find. The thing i like most about it, if you play a song in search bar, it gives most relevant and similar song suggestions which is difficult to find in other apps. Moreover, it's graphics and playlists are literally loveable."
"This app is the #1 in my opinion (And a lot of others, because it is #1). It has never not have a song that I want, and all-in-all great app. I would recommend getting the premuim edition."
"I have Spotify on every day at work and in my car. When I do listen to the radio and hear a song I like, I immediately find it on Spotify and I get a station that plays other songs that I find I enjoy too! Makes my work day go by quickly and painlessly!"
Great app. Catch up on all my podcasts and have a few playlists for the daily commute. Easy to use and intuitive
"Family plan is definitely worth it especially living with 2 siblings. Simple yet elegant UI, easy to use and navigate through."
The daily playlists are very well customised and suit my music style. Discovering new music has become very easy and better in quality.
"The app rarely crash now, thanks to the regular update and bug fixing. The new design is nice and smooth."
"My absolute favorite music streaming app! Great quality of sound, building endless playlists, huge selection of artists. All around wonderful."
"Excellent. Even the free service is quite unobtrusive. With a fantastic selection of artists in all styles. Very easy to navigate and use, even for a first timer."
I love this app's UI design and all the functions of the application works! I never had a problem with spotify and use this app everyday on my normal commute to work and back home! You host all of my favorite musicians on this platform as well üòç Keep up the great work and shoutout to your software engineers as well for holding it down!
"I LOVE spotify premiuim, it keeps me going on my long drives, my homework and when I clean my house. I listen to my own playlist and can download them for on the go. I have yet to have a problem. Love that I switched from pandora"
"Switched from Pandora and will never go back. Spotify is very intuitive. Easy to move from one audio device to another flawlessly. Would like to see more consistency between the interfaces. Windows app, web site, android to android auto all are slightly different."
By far best streaming app. I had itune but it was very heavy and lagging all time. Spotify is cheaper quicker and easy to customise. glad I made this move
"I use it all the time, it's the quickest and easiest way to have access to quality music everywhere. It is without a doubt one of the best tools to find music too, as it provides fantastic recommendations. Would recommend any day!"
"Absolutely fantastic. I just wish that I had discovered Spotify sooner. Love listening to such cool tunes, and incredible that they Taylor make days of tunes just to suit my taste in music. It,s like these guys really know me. I,m super impressed with Spotify. Magically great job guys. Thank you so much. It,s made a happy change to my life . No kiddin!"
"simply love spotify but lately it's been moving a little slow when i go on to the app then into my music. It has never been like that, please restore quicker service!"
"I know it's quitely late to say this is an amazing music app. It's indeed not free since it require me to upgrade to premium member. But once I upgraded, I aint feel any regression. Good app"
Great selection of songs. Excellent search function. Save your favorite albums and songs. Can cast from your cell phone or tablet easily to your TV via Roku. Free service requires listening to some commercials every half hour but very tolerable versus listening to radio.
Best music app there is. Hands down. Spotify premium keeps me in the loop with all my favorite artists new releases and download at the tap of a button. What more could you want?!
"After being using the app for a while I was very pleased by the songs recommendation algorithms, it simply suggests the next song that fits perfectly, whatever the genre mood... 5 bucks a month is quite reasonable due to free options but royalties are a must. I love it! Thank you."
"When it comes to streaming music and podcasts. This is the best app. Can pretty much find everything I want, and its a clean design."
"I've use Spotify for the best part of 10 years. Cant fault it, the user experience day one was great and it has only improved."
"The type of app that I've been dreaming of since childhood. Great quality with regards to music, variety and design of the app. Only downside is that it's sometimes laggy on Android system."
"please add Playback Speed. i really love this app and paid for this. im using this for guitar practicing songs but when a particular song is fast, i push myself to use other music app just to keep that particular song part in slow speed. so please, can you add Playback Speed?!"
"The algorithms for finding music beyond what I listen to can be quite impressive, especially when I'm looking for new things to listen to. It's not perfect but it hits the mark more often than not."
Spotify isn't as feature packed as other music apps but damn me if it isn't really good at what it does. Recommendations are always on point & playback is fluid and stutter free with minimal or no buffering time even when I'm using it on data. You can seamlessly switch playback from one device to other which just seems magical. Other music apps with all their features rarely recommend music that match my taste as well as Spotify does which is all that matters really. 10/10 would listen again
Awesome all around. Dropped music for like a week once. But was quickly fixed. I recommend it to everyone. I have the family plan. Super worth it.
"It's rare to get such a good experience from an app. I use it everyday, and after a month I'm still finding features that are intuitive and useful."
"I have had a wonderful time with this app, very easy to use! I also had a problem with my account being taken by another person at one point, the support was easy to follow and they were quick to resolve the issue."
"I think Spotify has every song ever writen. they say if a billion aire ever droped an $100.00 bill. the time it would take to bend over and pick it up, well he would lose money... now if Spotify ever stopped and tried to count their songs that they own, they could build a rocket and fly a man to mars and back before before they would finish counting."
"I am in LOVE. Spotify is loyal, trustworthy, and rarely quits. It provides me with all my necessary music fixes and then some. It knows me. üòÇ thanks Spotify."
Great source for a variety of music. After learning from a friend in the buisness that spotify actually supports the artists I can't recomend it enough.
An excellent app. I was directed towards Spotify by my workers several months ago and use it when I'm driving in the country. I have a good selection of my favourite songs in my library which is easily accessible with the touch of a few buttons. Highly recommend it.
i love this app so much and i am a premuim user. i keep updating the app and even re downloading it bucause it cuts the music off and switches song while in standby mode and even when i have the phone in my hand while im using it... if someone could help me fix this that would be great!
"Been using Spotify for a few years now. love the fact you can create and share your own play lists. Also the huge variety of music that I often dip into, exploring new genres. Only thing I have to be careful about is whilst teaching First Aid (CPR) to a group of school children. I went to play Staying Alive on my phone, ramping up the volume!!! Only to be puzzled why my phone was quiet. The text message off the scared to death wife at home, reminded me it was set to the wireless speakers...."
Multi-OS Compatible application (Mac / Windows / Linux / iOS/ Android) built with multi-sync feature and high quality audio tracks is one of the most desired apps that you'd wanna have if you are a true audiophile. The intermittent adverts do get annoying at times but well the premium plans don't tend to burn a hole in your pocket either. Absolutely recommend Spotify!
"This app is honestly the best, all song I want are there. The app works efficiently and effectively. Quality of songs provided is absolutely amazing. Does not require a lot of data usage üëåüëåüëå It also has beautiful playlists provided. Definitely press that INSTALL button It's worth it"
Very comprehensive catalogue. Suits my catholic taste down to the ground. Excellent quality of playback too. Good integration between mobile/tablet and smart TV apps.
I've had it for years. consider it to be well rounded when pitted against other music players. UI is pretty straight forward. There was one version that was hard to navigate at one point.
"There is a lot of beautiful music on this app. There's a vatiety of music, ranging from orcastral covers to pure rain to calm down. They don't skimp on youtube covers either, allowing my favorite creators a wider chance at being heard. Rock covers for video game music, a trio of pro guitarists! Not to mention, it's fun to guess which of your favorite songs will be put on next on your choosen playlist. The mood you have will bring out the next song you love. The randomness is fun in of its selfüòÄ"
Spotify is absolutely exceptional. It's customer service is always helpful and quickly resolved problems. I've had Spotify for years now and I don't see any other way
"i was hesitant about it. I have always bought my own music and i have hundreds of cds and multiple single songs from itunes. But I decided to give it a shot and i do not regret it at all! spotify is a quick way to find new music and it can tell you when new music from the artists you follow is out( aswell as if they are playing in a town near you). I do find the algorythm a bit sloppy at times though. if you can, i'd still reccomend buying the artists cds irl or other medias."
"I'm having the same issue as many other users due to the new Samsung update. The music will randomly stop, the buttons to change the song from the lock screen and widgets no longer work, and I can't use any other bluetooth connection (headphones and car speaker) to change songs. Please fix these issues"
I got 3 months premium for 7 Euro on offer at the beginning of the summer and it has been worth it. My favorite way to stream music and podcasts as well as having the offline feature is great on premium. highly recommend if you are a frequent listner. you will definitely find something you like. the new ui is a bit of a hit or miss but overall ots great once you get used to it.
"Spotify is the best music app out there. I've been using it for years and it has been amazing for listening any music at any time. I only miss the quick buttons to sort and search a playlist, which was there in the past. Please bring it back! It would also be a great improvement if there were patch notes for each new release on each platform. I would like to know what has changed to the app I use everyday!"
"Excellent UI system, with brilliant music PLAYBACK. The connectivity between mobile, pc and web Spotify applications - the ability to pick up a song where you left off is really what drew me in. An amazing Playlist creation system, simple drag and drop songs on Spotify desktop. I emplore anyone looking for a quality music streaming service to give Spotify a try, it's worth it."
"Spotify is a super diverse music app. Besides minor bugs here and there, it runs smoothly 98% of the time and is quite useful for accessing a gigantic music library. Kudos to you Spotify!"
Spotify has always allowed me to listen to what I want and where I want with their Premium service. I also enjoy their recommended songs because they are genuinely what I like to listen to.
this is the best music playing app ive had i love being able tk listen 30 minutes of music without interruptions from ads be a little beter with an hour but i love how u can make and build your own group of songs i also like the dark theme aspect of the app this is bu far a great app
"I am entirely happy with my use of Spotify. I don't tell friends and family to use certain apps much but Spotify is one I don't hesitate to share with everyone. Its so good its one of the few apps I actually pay to use. Its just a few bucks a month which gives me unlimited access from any device and the ability to control what I'm playing from one device while its playing on another. You can save music and artists you like, you can build playlists and share them! This is the service you want."
I love spotify Great selection of music and its user friendly. I have foynd and listened to sounds I hadnt heard in quite the minute and songs I heard yesterday. Also love the daily mix.
Has got the best ever algorithms for song suggestions. It almost knows more about the type of music that you like than ourselves. The UI is also slick and cool
The best app for music ! I like its feature where it curates playlist based on your artist selection and updates it daily. No need to search and create a playlist it will just generate it for you. Interface is quite simple to use so that is why I am rating it 5 stars. Good work team !
Best way to discover new music quickly. But the best of all is It creates different personalized playlists just for the user.
If you think pandora is so great and believe its true then try spotify premium just for the trial week. You'll see very quickly why Spotify blows them out of the water!! With seemless playback and equalizer seetings that outmatch google music and also rewind or fast forward as much as you want in a song to skip to the good parts or replay your favorite part?? Forget about it bro Spotify has it all!
Technology what a awsome app every song i have chosen has been on it and the fact its quite easy to use makes it very convenient i like the bluetooth part !!play all my favourite songs from the palm of my hand
Spotify unfolds to be an outstanding and a marvellous music streaming application in India. I had been longly waiting for this jewel to release in India. As expected Spotify beats it! It has an amazing user flexiblity specifically more outrageous for its graphical UI. The Premium membership tends to be more decent when compared with Apple Music.
"using it for 3 years excellent ui, always getting upgraded and looking good tons of really cool and convinient features i'd love if they could return on their next update where i can see on any playlists how many songs there are in it, because it was romoved..."
"spotify is a great app, you may want premeium though. never takes long to download anything! great for quick stops. two suggestions i have are 1:having a timer, personally i like to listen to music while i sleep, but i dont want it on all night, a timer to shut the music off would be great. 2: mabey make the music able to play without the app being open in your tabs/backround, just suggestions! from: a thrilled user!"
"Amazing app, well designed and good presentation, good service and listening qualitie. In my experience, it's probably better than apple music, because of personalization features or maybe of more setting options, also because of the capability of connect this app with all the smart environment. This is just an opinion, if you give a chance to Spotify, you will live a unique experience."
"The app is great. I enjoy using it. But i was thinking at one thing. When i search music it will be awsome to search a song in the app like on shazam. i hate when i hear a new song, use shazam then go to spotify and search again. maybe a new button on search section üòÅ"
"Excellent service! Just needs a better way to filter your liked tracks as it is a bit clunky to need to hit menu button in order to search for songs you like. This used to exist, but was removed. I used the feature often to filter a playlist by a particular artist."
"Love the versatility Spotify has with its options, amazing interface and very simple to understand. I wish there was customizable options for the music player UI but thats my only gripe! :)"
"Spotify premium is possibly the best music streaming app there is. It features almost all artists out there, isn't limited to just english songs, and has all the best features you'd want from a streaming app. youve got playlists that make themselves, daily mixes made from what you listen to, a release radar, and even a dj mode where the songs merge into one another. And lets not forget an in built sleep timer for when you're falling asleep. I love spotify."
pretty good. only a couple of issues with dropping service and I'm not certain if that was because the building security since other's were having similar issues.
"This app is always overlooked by the general population as being one of the best designed apps around because its now a necessity! It doesnt feel like a third party app, it feels like it was designed with your phone!!!"
"If its ok can u guys add on phones to go restart on song like on tablet and computer, and the back button so u can go back to other songs. Because i have a fav song and it ends the next song plays, but i really wanna go back to it but i cant. So if u can make it to where we can for phones then thats great. Besides that i love this app its amazing."
"I just wish they had more obscure songs on here. But other than that, love it!!! The more you listen and like, the better the playlists that are built for you. Great for finding new music."
"so they've done a great job with the Podcasts side. which was my gripe in a past review. UI has changed quite a bit but search is really good, and can search for songs, artists and podcasts. I'm happy paying the monthly fee because its great"
This app is awesome if you have premium. So worth the extra mulla to have your playlist and awesome relevant suggested music to make your playlist feel fresh building on your original music! 10 out of 10 would recommend‚úå
"Finally, it's available in India. Really like the fact that they made more features available in the free version for Indians, basically makes the app fully usable for free. And the subscription fees are also quite affordable, esp their student plans; for no ads and offline saving capability it's a really good deal. Kudos to the team behind Spotify. My only request is that they expand their library, which I'm sure they do so no complains here. 5 stars from me ‚úåÔ∏è"
"This is fantastic. Able to listen to any artist, song or album and save it for later. being able to pick and choose the songs for your own playlist is amazing. Ive been looking for this kind of a service for quite some time. Highly recommended!"
intuitive app that introduces the user to new music they wouldn't have otherwise probably find. I know I wouldn't find what spotify presents to me consistently!
"Great app, better than any of its Indian rivals. The music suggestion engine is far better than any other app. Also the custom suggestions aren't there in any other app. Have been waiting for its launch in India. They surprised us with their quick launch and support for south and north Indian songs."
"Love this app, don't understand what everyone is on about with difficult UI. All seems incredibly simple to me. I have premium and can access everything easily and select anything I want to play specifically with the play queue. I haven't experienced any crashing issues and only crashes rarely at a frequency equal to all my other apps (more phone issues than the app). Love the ease of using speakers but it is a shame I can't play synced music with other devices"
"The best music player, bar none. Clean UI, vast array of songs and awesome connectivity options. It would be even better if you added a Sleep functionality, which lets you turn off the player after a specified duration of time. edit: new update includes the sleep function as well. Awesome addition."
it's really fun to pick and listen to our fav music! then only thing is that I want is that they won't turn off the forward button if that's a fav song and we want to read listen to it! thats all other than that I love this app
"With the recent updates, its gotten a lot better. It's good to finally have a built-in sleep timer. I haven't got any other complaints apart from using the bluetooth in my car. I like to listen to songs on repeat a lot, and that function disappears in the car. Other than that, I'm very satisfied."
literally the best music app for all you music lovers out there.... it has a very good UI and is extremely easy to use... has great quality music and album art... definitely the best of the best....
"I pay premium and despite what people say, its defintly better for listing to music without a bijillion diffrent ads every 30 minuites. defintly recommed spotify and its premium feature.üòâ"
I should thank spotify for breaking my song listening pattern. I have now started to listen to other genres besides Rap and Hip hop. I love the UI and collection of songs of course.
"its very wasy to use, also provides you a variety of songs of your own choice. loved the presentation of graphics as compared to other music apps ."
"Resisted getting Spotify for so long... then eventually caved. It's great for random playlists, and probably perfect for those willing to pay Premium. Just sad that it doesn't have every album by every artist quite yet. Maybe that will come with time. Excellent app though."
"I wake up in the morning and can hear happy birds chirping and the sound of happy memories from people walking by and... I open Spotify and drown out all that happy with some mega volume SAD BUT TRUE by METALLICA and revel in the dark shadows of my own pit of despair and feel the rage inside turn into sounds of pure bliss. Nothing Else Matters!! I bow to you Lord Spotify and your powers of awesomeness!!! Peter. J. Moore. "" Can't ubiquitous forlorn "" 'sc ream' - 1978-2019 - when the bell tolls"
Best music streaming service. Intuitive design and constantly adding new features. Only gripe is I wish there were more swipe gestures on Android like there is on iOS
"Best app for people who love music. I love music, I love convenience and it lacks nothing.. Best user experience, intergrates well will smart devices, and after service has been great..üíôüëç"
So much more customized than Pandora. play list options are awesome. so far Library is on point and the daily and weekly recommended artists match the genre's I listen to the prior week. Running into old artist's i forgot about & discovering new ones i probably wouldn't otherwise run into working 45-50 hours a week. Apple music an Google Music aren't quite there yet.
"The music quality is great ! Any playlist can be found in spotify . Although there is advertisement but the condition is fair enough because after advertisement, you'll get to stream 30 minutes of music without ads interruption. But there is an issue I'd like to report , it's about the ads that needs to be close . Those ads just won't close when I press the 'DISMISS' or the 'x' button. Please fix this bug ASAP becuase I'm gettin' real sick of it. Thank you !"
"Dont want to be dramatic or anything, but this is the very best app in the entire universe! The sync betweet devices, the personalization, the UI. everything is just convenient and pleasant! I LOVE YOU Spotifiy!!"
best music streaming app. basicly like having every song ever made at the press of a button. great quality never have any issues. well worth paying for the monthly premium.
Best music interface yet. Could have a better way of making playlist quickly though. And it would be nice to reset all liked songs without deleting your library and saved songs.
"It is definitely an amazing app and I strongly recommend it. There is a wide variety of songs,creators and playlists to try out! If you don't like inappropriate music then you can filter the songs that have strong words or suggestive phrases so that they can't be listened to. Also,the audio is fluid and smooth. You can make your own playlists made of songs you like! Spotify most certainly deserves 5 stars! I Strongly recommend Spotify for music lovers."
"Fantastic app. Music quality is great, the UI has high usability. It's easy to search for a particular song, or artist as well as the creation of playlists is very easy. The Downloading of songs is very good as you can change the sound quality level of your music. Overall a excellent app."
"one of the most fluid music platforms, wish more integrations with other great platforms could be made, but all in time, still one of the best ways to listen to tour favorite artist and find new music"
"The app is totally for a good music experience.it has such a beautiful UI.The recommended content,albums,trending are so accurate and up to dated.Guys do go for this one if you realy want a perfect experience of music.!"
"Hey Spotify team, your app is just amazing üëçüëçüëç.After my account on JioSaavn got deleted, I was searching for a nice music app and this is just perfect. I've been using it for almost a week in my dad's phone and now I downloaded it in my phone as well. It works quite smoothly. There are no problems till now and even the music quality is very good. Thanks for such an amazing app üòç"
"Great for music if looking for a free music app, the ads you can understand, and all the buttons are displayed pretty good. Overall, a nice app."
"I love spotify, yeah it may have a few downfalls.. but, for a free app, it truly is amazingly convenient. It offers so much and the premium prices are surprisingly reasonable. Although the ads you receive for premium do become quite repetitive, that's just something you have to deal with I suppose. Besides that I really do believe this app deserves five whole stars."
"Great music, there isn't a song I haven't been able to find. The app however is wonky, navigating the song que is quite strange. Regardless, the quality of music availability demands 5 stars."
Great music and fantastic playlist. The only drawback is not being able to put artist in alphbetical order or by genre. Which would make it easier to make my own personal playlist. But I am LOVING it. I am strongly thinking about becoming Premium real soon after I build my library.
"awesomeness. spotify has podcasts, linguistic training, and of course music. spotify gives you so much more for less than what many other subscriptions cost."
No better music streaming app built yet. Although I'd love if there were an option to add a new song I just searched to queue while I am already listening to the previous song.
"Just started to use the service and am liking it a lot so far. Great range of genres, lets you build your own playlists that you can take wherever you go."
I on family premium right now. Im using data connection on my phone. I got a problem or q system bug. I already turned on download wifi settings still off is showing. Fix this cant download song. Your button is useless
Great for all situations. Links up with discord and all devices with widgets and built in functionality. lacks slightly with the way in which if you have a rolling contract that all your downloaded songs can dissapear if you catch it on the wrong day and has slightly less bitrate quality than can be found with apple music but is a fantastic deal for students and greater customisability than all other apps. Would benefit from a party or group function to ad songs on the fly to a queue.
"Free version is awful by design, forcing ads and no way to turn off shuffle. But the paid version is absolutely worth it, I use it every day to play my favorite music and find new music and podcasts. Its Spotify. you know what it is."
"What can I say apart from this app is totally the best way to listen to your favourite music. Spotify is simply mind blowing. very good job Devs keep up the fantastic work, music to suit everyone's taste"
"I was waiting for this app for quite a long time and now when it finally got released in India, I downloaded it . Plus , the app has various list of artists and songs, which is awesome.üëç"
Overall probably the best in it's category. What I would like: - more podcasts (i.e. thoseincluded in Google assistant service) - ability to see lists and playlists on car infotainment systems - ability to mark several songs in a list/playlist (not having to select an option for each song separately- annoying when tried to unlike 89 songs...) - inbuilt equalizer to work in all devices despite the fact that a device may have it's own.
"The best music service, with great device support, excellent quality, and a fast, clear app. The designers and development team should be proud."
Once you get premium the ads go away and its wonderful. The app makes daily playlists based on you music taste as well which helps find new music and builds your own personal playlists.
"As one who makes playlists by him self, it has been easier then ever. Not to complex as the UX is just right - even with the driving mode! I personally love how high quality the music is and I love that about of YouTube musicians use as I can listen to their music in it."
"Of all the music streaming apps, Spotify is the only one the cares about the overall user experience. I have been a premium member since 2012, and I will always be one!"
Love the UI and song selection process. And most of the songs are available in every country. Not region or country restricted like others. So love it.üòò
"I have tried them all and SPOTIFY is the hands-down winner for the streaming quality, content selection, dashboard, graphics and of course, VALUE. The onboard EQ with Dolby Atmos is 9/10. Very efficient use of our Mobile Data, also. Six licenses for everyone in the house. $14.99 per month. Four adults in my house...SPOTIFY is the only thing we mostly all agree onüòÑüôàüôäüôâ"
"WAY better than Pandora. Search your fav artists and hear full albums, not just one song in a sea of other recommended artists songs. With Spotify I've built a playlist for every mood and activity."
"Loving this app! The recommendations are wonderfully suited to my taste and mood. I came from Google Play Music, which is great in its own right, but lacked the fluidity of Spotify."
"spotify is a wicked music app, worth paying for, i share it between 2 devices as long as ones not connected to the internet i can listen on both or if im connected to a stereo via AUX i can use the second device to change the song! i also have it connected to my ps4 and can control the app from my phone to play off my console, it also has a great selection of music, not all of the songs i want are there but they have wide band of differnt genres"
love the new app design. very well organized and easy to find the songs/podcasts I want to listen to. easy to find new songs too!
great for building and finding good playlists to listen to on the road. pretty wide selection of music. the experience isn't too bad without premium either.
"All music exists on this software. For $10/mo you can literally steal the soul of all the great masters of every genre of music from the beginning of recorded music. The 3 major label conglomerates take most of the money, leaving only crumbs for the writers and performers. It's a great way to find the music you love, even make playlists for offline play, but for Christ's sake, if you love an artist, find other ways to support them. Buy some designer vinyl, go to shows..."
Tried all other music streaming services but nothing compares to Spotify UI and their algorithms to select music based on what I've already listened to. 5*
"I recently moved from Google Play to Spotify after it was launched in India and till now it has been a great experience. I specifically like its mac app and recommendations. They can somewhat improve on search. Unlike YouTube music, you are required to type exact name of the bollywood songs which sometime becomes irritating."
it's one of the best music streaming services out there. I loved how they have a vast library and personalized playlist that always suit my taste. loved it
"Really clean design, good music quality. And I absolutely LOVE the recommended music Playlist. It changes every monday and curates new music for me so I don't have to search."
Easy and intuitive way to navigate music. The suggestions based off what you listen to are great.
"Excellent Library, regardless of taste. Interface is intuitive. i would prefer better playlist making options."
"I'm now happy with the app, but I would redesign the UI to show more content other than music. It's quite hard to find it and it's hilarious that is the case nowadays."
I like the playlists and free music. The commercials aren't bad. They're less frequent than broad cast radio. Premium is required for downloads/offline playing.
very nicely designed app with consistently updated options. ive never not found a song on spotify but spotify does make money through their premium membership so without that you cant play specific songs on demand
officially the best music app for international music. wide variety and range of different genres of music. all popular singers writers producers. genuinely authentic app UI. new equaliser is absolutely amazing. song fades into the next song which is quite amazing when you are listening to music.
"I LOVE Spotify! I'm cheap and don't like to pay for things, but this is a must and I gladly pay every month for years now. I can find any song I'm looking for and it's connected to Shazam so I can quickly add a song to a play list. I also love that I can share song on other platforms. Spotify gets 5 stars from me!!"
"Spotify, id be so lost without you! have had premium service now for about 7 years and it covers everything i need from genre to suit my mood or alter my mood - to almost every artist you follow or just cant get enough of . Tells you where all your fav artists next gigs are and for 11.99 a month you have non stop music without annoying ads. it is playable across all your devices at same time and can have family accounts also if you had one bill payer and multiple Spotify users in same house!!!"
"It even works offline... Couldn't ask for much more. I would like to offer a suggestion for something others may like as well however. I would really like a reliable alarm clock built into the app. Maybe add a feature like ""wake up to this song"", that prompts you to set up an alarm etc. Thanks,"
Spotify is great for when you want music on the go. The suggested weekly playlists makes it seem like Spotify knows exactly the kind music you want to hear to suit your mood.
"Had Spotify for quite some time now, even got to take advantage of the free Google home mini at the time. Great programming behind the app, clever and concise."
"I live for this app, it's really cool! I recomend to get premium right away if you only use it on a phone just because you won't be able to listen to the song you want but the one the shuffle picks for you and for PC user, the only bad part are the ads but it's not that bad. premium is quite nice you can listen to it without internet if you download playlist! I recommend 100%."
"love the UI and simplicity of it. collection and playlist is lovely, fact that one can remove a song from playlist is something great. podcast sets this one apat."
My favorite music source! Quite possibly couldn't function without it. The Spotify premium benefits are so worth it and the price is reasonable! Love this app
i have to stay that this my #1 recommendation for a music app . It Consist of almost every song in the world + its ui experience seem to be user friendly but their is some fix had to be taken the in ui for better experience.
"It is so great that I can listen to my poscasts and music on the same app. You may have had problems starting podcasts that have been around for forever and are super long. If you want start from their beginning, there's a sorting button that allows you to sort each upload descending and ascending by date."
"Fantastic app I use it daily for long bus travels and car trips and gaming on my Xbox. The UI is amazing although sometimes unresponsive and the audio quality is outstanding, I do wish we were able to customise it however even if it was a premium feature where we could add bass or reduce bass or even add treble or change the dynamics that would be cool to see In the future"
I have been using this app for years. I have tried other apps but i resort back to Spotify. I have only had one issue with and that was a certain artist wouldn't play. When I contacted them they quickly fixed it and were super nice!
"very quick on gettin new releases.Very easy to download, the offline player works great and I really enjoy how spotify watches how I play my music and what music I play and makes me personal playlist."
Always great sound clean gui. I do hear from very well respected and much loved musicians feel you take too much cut for fronting them. Kinda counterproductive to the music scene on the whole. We need more music not less please look at this from your highrise. twang
"Never really had a chance to freely experience music until this app. It works great and it's nicely intuitive, gives me what I wanted quickly and easily! The amount of artist and music is absolutely amazing! Its been my most used app as of late."
My favorite aspect of Spotify is the song radio. Their software is extremely intuitive and I always find new music that I love in the generated playlist. So many absolute bangers!
"it's nice. not a huge fan of the UI, but definitely love the podcast they have. Just switched from iTunes, getting used to interface."
"been using for 3 years now perfect, albums released on time every time, no delay, good quality had 1 issue about a month ago where my songs were skipping without me pressing the button, but after a re install its running good as new"
"thanks spotify for the great music. just one issue with samsung galaxy S10e users, the shortcut button to toggle online and offline mode is not working.. anyway to resolve this issue? thank you."
"Excellent app. Could find pretty much everything I looked for. Spotify support super nice and helpful, updates regularly and quite affordable. The default music app! Would be cool to be able to find more podcasts and audio books! P.S.: review based on paid subscription"
"Essential Entertainment. I link my Spotify account to all my devices, and enjoy access to a huge library of music to suit every mood, wherever and whenever I want. I have complex PTSD, and the ability to focus on the music is sometimes the only way to get through an attack. Spotify also makes it easy to share songs with my friends."
"A streaming service like nothing before its time. A revolution in music listening, for good and bad. Artists get worked over initially but get but promotion, and discovery than ever before...fair? Not sure. But it is here to stay and the app looks great and designed well too. Cheers"
The superior music streaming platform. The app is super intuitive and the song/playlist recommendations are on point. 10/10.
The UI is pleasing to look at and it is easy to find songs and other content you like. The app's own recommendations aren't too bad either.
"Wonderful app. My favorite of all the mainstream music streaming services. Premium is well worth the payment, and the new UI is beautiful."
"SPOTIFY IS, MUSIC STREAMING SUPREMECY. CRITICISM; adding a track to several playlists(P.L.) requires tedious repetition, becoming a major reduction to app fluidity. PLEASE, DEVS, give us a solution. [e.g.(in song options/add song to P.L.)(*longpress P.L. tile*/=enables=*tap to select multiple tiles*)] plz&thx"
"I love to listen to every jondra of music out in the world today and Spotify always has the music I seek. At times I flash back to my era of R & B Music and it takes me back to my good old days, which heals me. You place your request and up pops your request. Not only that, it builds up your library and reminds you of what artist's albums you've played, which saves you the time of having to search for it again. And a plus, it Show Cases all the album's that artist is credited for."
"Ads are the worst, but its really nice being able to preview the music and like some songs to help build up your library."
I love spotify. it's there whenever I need some music to suit my mood. easy to navigate and loads of choice.
"Genuinely worth your subscription. Find anything you enjoy, create playlists, get amazing suggestions on what to add to those playlists, take your music everywhere for any occasion/event. Excellent compatibility between devices and services, easy customizable optimization menus, and lots of your favourite remixes from smaller artists. 10 out of freakin' 10"
This is a bug in android .. Steps to reproduce ... song is already playing in background mode... after some time I want to change the song.... I launched the app ad is displayed.. so I dismiss it... screen is updated to song details page and I click back.. again ad is displayed and henceforth it keeps on looping... Anyways I love the app.. just want it to be bugfree with best UX to all users. Adios
"I've been using it for a couple of years now and the thing I really like about it is that the app learns your taste of music and after a while you won't need to find the new music, music will come to you effortlessly. and there's this thing that would be to great implemented: when i shuffle my songs in the library, instead of randomly queuing up what to play next, it stabilizes the mood while randomizing, like putting together the songs with the same gerne."
"easy to use, enjoyable, and quite a complete song bank. The down side is that if you're a free to use, prepare for ads and frustrating shuffles"
"having been very skeptical, I have found this app to be so intelligent. The quick order in which my playlists have come together and the overall accessibility. An excellent experience, and I, like you, just love my music!"
I was a long time user of Pandora before I was recommended Spotify. I fell in love with the UI immediately and the musical selection is as wide and bipolar as me!
Spotify has always been great. The interface is so user friendly and it's way superior than other streaming apps designwise and in catalogue.
All algorithms are not the same! Of the music apps only Spotiy seems to do more than devine my general demographic and then unerringly feed me hits from the year i graduated high school. Spotify gets me. Spotify figured out that i like Mongolian garage rock of the 60s and Miles Davis and Willie Nelson and Congolese chants and Penguin Cafe Orchestra and 70s kraut rock and Nancy Sinatra and obscure and early blues recordings.
love it.. what more can I say... tonnes of great music and if you dont mind ads its totally free.. can build huge playlists of favourite songs and then just shuffle play and let it do its thing..
Very good. But the download to listen offline is kind of confusing and complicated. I wish Spotify can have a download button for each song which makes thing easier.
Great app. Easy to use. My one complaint is that the menu button is right next to the scroll bar so sometimes when you're trying to add a song to the queue you scroll instead.
Great app but could they move the dismiss button somewhere else for the ads. I keep clicking things behind the ads and they don't close down till I close the app
I switched over from Google Music. This is far simpler to use and its very intuitive. It creates all my play lists for me.
"Surprised at how well this app was able to find music I liked. Easy to make playlists. Ads are quick, and not so frequent - so they don't bother me."
"Haven't had a lot of hiccups, which is nice while in China (a lot of apps require VPN). Works well on data; pauses and plays itself whenever media turns on in another app."
Better than other music players. love the feature where you build a playlist and it has recommendations for songs to add to that particular playlist.
"The best app for music streaming, although sometimes I missed keeping offline music on my phone (but well...). Spotify never crashed and the premium subscription is totally affordble. I love the playlist feature as well. Just put everything there and I can choose a playlist which suits my moods on different days. Go spotify!"
"Amazing overall app. Ads are very annouing, but it's a simple and nice app that allows you to listen to good music. It obviously doesnt work offline unless you have premium, but that's fine with me! Although i personally dont like that it takes up about 500-600 MB for me, personally"
"Every song you would ever want to listen to. Make playlist, find other's playlist, browse similar artist, download playlist so you don't have to use data. Wouldn't ever change to another music streaming app... unless they raised their prices quite a bit."
"Great app, love the play lists built so many, well with the subscription for family, my wife and I haven't bought a CD in ages, don't ever really struggle to find a track, have had some glitches now and again but tend to be resolved in following update"
"easy to use, great quality sound, and super intuitive! all of the personalized stations are great! I don't know how their algorithms work, but they are dead on when it comes to finding suggestions for new music and playing artist's radio."
"Update: thank you for listening to our suggestions, works awesome again. Keep it up! Please do something asap with the resolution of the app's design. For 6.3 inch phones (1080x2340 px) the icon looks awful when opening up and the home screen enlarged and disproportionate. Edit: latest update seems to solve this, great!"
"Genuinely my most favourite app on the phone. If I had the entire day to not do anything, I would probably just spotify the whole day. The recommendation engine is just out of this world as is the playlist curation. Easily the best app to listen to music on. Hope the Indian version gets access to all the music in the world soon and not just the limited access that it has right now."
excelent service quick response and seemless followons. also a vast and varied selection. Spotify collections and mood themes are outstanding.
"Awesome music apps!! Complete collections of all, best quality, very much user friendly, suitable for all of your emo & feelings. One of must have apps in your devices!!!"
"I tried and liked Spotify. Spotify is ahead of Google Play Music & Apple Music in terms of Playlists and sound customizing options. Very good selection of playlists and at night one can use diff sound modes, normalize, quiet, loud which you cannot find in other apps. Collection is also good. Almost all the collection you can find here as well. Stability of app is much better than Apple Music"
"This app is amazingly build! I'm still a free user, but they provide a playlist which I could freely choose without getting shuffled to another song. The playlist even have a cpllection of wondrous songs!"
"Easy to use, UI is easy on the eyes, easily finding new music to enjoy and staying on top of the latest releases from your fa ourite artists. Dead set was meant to only use the 3 month free trial and go back to YouTube/downloading free music but even up using for almost whole 2 years and counting and paying for the premium! highly suggest you give it a go because yes, Spotify doesn't have some of specific tracks from specific artists but like... high quality playback......"
"hey there i personally have not used your service but my family 5 members us use it often. love your app and have enjoyed it very much vis a vi my family. nice very nice. it is wonderful to know that i can listen to music at anytime. quite nice really. i will get there eventually. my listening music is Christian and classic. But 2 of my favorite songs from the 60's are by the ""Rascals""govin"" and it's a ""Beautiful Morning"" please post this. love to chat. fun fun fun"
"Great application for finding songs, playlist and keeping a collection of music to get you through tough times. God has blessed me through quick access to music."
"Fantastic App with all the music you could ever wish for. Would be great to have a select button to be able to move more then one song to a different or new playlist at once, could also be used to share more then one song at once."
"The best music app ever! Simple UI, better song recommendations, and infinite playlists, songs based on genre, mood, country, region... Everything is blended well into spotify. Thanks."
"While the user interface has a rather steep learning curve and some of the buttons are quite touchy, once you are comfortable with it, the myriad and range of different things you can do, is unmatched as far as streaming apps go IMO."
"love it!! the free version obviously has ads but I don't think it's too bad and you can watch a quick video to get 30 min of ad free music. i make my own playlist and they pretty much have everything i search for, for the most part."
I will say I was skeptical about spotify Free account versus premium account but I've been a member of spotify for a while now and I have must got to say I'm quite happy not being able to fast forward more than a certain amount of times and being able to start your playlist off with their specific track and now that who is involved with spotify premium $10 a month is certainly well worth it
an amazing app that lets you play music for free i've tried cople free music app and u mostly got a limited amount of musics and short period of time to hear a certain music. thanks spotify. with the app you've built i became adicted to hearing music everytime i'm easting my time on my phone üòä
"its an amazing app, you can listen to all kinds off music for free, create your own playlist and organize it however you want, you also get a mix that suits your taste in music called discovered weekly which refreshes every monday."
Stamps Apple music into the dirt. Can be played across all formats and all my favourite albums are available to download.....unlike Apple music which I found quite limited.
good on the Premium. a suggested Discoverly Weekly list that i get 15 likable tunes out of 30 or so ..once.. you get a library built of liked/custom play lists . that's worth more than 4 CDs a month (that may only contain 2-3 good songs)
"Easy to navigate app. Literally every song you can think of on here. Premium is 100% worth going for, especially with the student discount deal. Go smash that download button."
"Simple, beautiful and a clean design which is easy to use. The recommended playlists are top notch, I've founs plenty of new songs and artists to listen to thanks to Spotify."
adds can get exhausting but they are only once every half hour and cheap to buy off if you but the app. Other then that it's a great app for music and has an excellent shuffle button for mixing up music
"Best music app! every music i want to listen is available on Spotify! simple UI, small app size, and easy to use. great job! :)"
"The app is great. The UI and the curated playlists are just amazing. The look and feel of the app is also pretty cool. Although, you might want to add a shuffle button and a repeat button in the player window in the android app :D"
"large selection of music and pre-built playlists. Premium and hulu for $10 a month, this is the best music player I've used."
"Cant live without it - Premium monthly service is so worth it. better then anything even close. Just wish it had built in lyrics!! Come on Spotify, we know you can do it!!"
App is all good and works well with my TV when its connected via WIFI. Been subscribed for quite a long time and will continue to do so as I'm searching for new songs to hear everyday
"This is the best music streaming app ,and you can take my word for it , if you don't wanna take of others. The apl knows your preferences and makes playlists best suited. It also streams new songs automatically, so your hassle of searching new songs is gone. And no, i am not being paid by Spotify."
"If you love classic rock and roll... Then just download it... it never gonna upset you from it's collection... But after launching in India, it seems some popular songs are not available... i hope the authority could have the concern to build it more flexible..."
Variety of options. Having an eclectic range of musical interests makes that a massive bonus. I personally like the build your own playlist feature.
Beautiful UI and amazing UX. Nicely curated selection of songs and playlist as per the taste of the user. Only issue is that the subscription price is higher than its competitors in India.
"Excellent. Spotify opens up the World of music. High quality device/sound controls .. accurate and appropriate suggestions very much related to the music you are listening to, easy to use intuitive application ... need I go on with an endless list of advantages over other platforms? Try it for yourself and see. üòä"
"Amazing app, awesome integration with other devices, quite open song selection, premium plans have fair prices and the app's interface overall is just intuitive and amazing to use, yet simple and somewhat elegant."
"it's been a good experience till now. It just got released in India and I'm happy it did. It has good features even in the freemium version. There's actually no requirement of the premium. The only thing is some songs aren't available to play in my country. Any help with this. Except that, this is my permanent music streamer now."
"The best app for streaming music in my opinion. Great UI, great recommendations and results, just an all-around great app. I will never use anything else."
"Great UI, all the music you could ever want, and they reccomend music that you might like through the Discover Weekly playlist. By the way, this is not a paid review, I just love this app. If you don't have it, get it. Hulu is also included with Spotify Premium, which is great and adds even more value to the $10 monthly subscription."
"Best UI, great selection of everything you could think of or want, so intuitive, and quick. Couldn't make it through a day without spotify."
"Love Spotify! I give it five stars because there isn't really anything I can complain about. I do wish the app had a built in equalizer, like a ten band. Also would love to see some hd options like Tidal. Tidals customer service is enough for me to never leave Spotify. please make this happen folks."
"Absolutely love this app, I created a14 hour wedding playlist on this!!!!, all sorts of songs and genre's of music to suit everyone. I love the freedom it gives you to listen to every different type of music you like then it gives you suggestions to other playlist you could be interested in. Once you have made your play lists they're there for as long as you want them and you have around a billion songs and artists to choose from. The absolute best app out there bar none!"
Awesome app and with premium only $9.99 you get Hulu included unlimited skips and no adds ! build your own playlists and listen offline anywhere. highly recommend for xbox users or any music enthusiast.
"I like that my music selections don't just ""disappear"" after I have built my playlists and that virtually any song I want I can download. Thank you Spotify!"
just got Spotify yesterday and it worked great so I got premium and now app won't even open................ As a previous business owner I know there are alway glitches and catch that screw things up. What show a GOOD business is how you answer and fix these issues. Spotify responded very quickly and had a fix for my problem immediately. To me that shows a good business.
"This is a truly awesome app. Fantastic selection of music, and intuitive programming that learns and remembers your specific music preferences, searches, preferred artists, etc. to build a number of daily playlists and recommendations specific to you and your style of music. Highly recommended app"
This app is amazing. I can't describe it. But i have 2 suggestion if you can make sure to add it public will really appreciate it. 1. Pls add lyrics option. Because many of the people like to read lyrics while song is playing. 2. Pls add a option to suffle songs. I suggest that you should also add a shuffle button to all playlists.
"The UI is easy to use, the student discount is amazing, and the song database is huge. I would recommend Spotify to anyone."
"as far as music streaming services go, this is my personal favorite. the UI is clean and easy to navigate and never have I wanted to hear a song and searched only to find it not there."
"Just getting started, but the tailored playlists are cool. Listening to some recent work by artists I haven't heard in quite a while, and offshoots of groups I was at one time very interested in. Then I see that my second playlist is much more the sorts of things I'm currently most involved in, so thematically very diverse and intriguing...curious what future lists might be comprised of."
Having access to my favorite music at the push of button has significantly improved the quality of my life. I never realized how much I was missing my favorite music until now. Thank you Spotify
"7 years strong! Been using this app for 7 years(premium), and haven't once had one issue. The library is massive and the UI is friendly(the new one looks very sleek) keep on keeping on Spotify, You have my vote!"
"App is great and 5 star for that but I would like more features. Things I would like to see in the app. - Repeat track option. - Sound Equilizer. - Swiping down at the ""Now Playing Song"" should take you back to where you were, navigation wise."
"Finally spotify is officially available in India. Everything else is great, but why aren't we getting the songs by Ed, Panic!, Paramore, Bruno, Twenty one pilots, etc. The list is very big! We are paying for a better music experience and it's quite well but still it feels incomplete. The new interface is good. Waiting for so long and we want to enjoy more music from our fav artists."
The new UI update is a big improvement! Really like that we can now turn off the musics videos autoplaying as i really prefer seeing the album art.
"When it comes to music, all what you need is a good set of hardware, and Spotify. Nothing else. Spotify never cease to amaze me how well built and how much rich it's"
"Great app, lots of music to choose from, introduced me to a lot of new songs I now daily listen to. One problem. The widget. You seem to have completely ignored it, it's always 4x1 size, and cannot be customized whatsoever. Think about the widget people, we love to customize our layouts of the screen, and this is just a nuisance at the moment. At least it works... Please consider making it customizable. Please"
This is the king of online music apps. Music lovers must have this app. It satisfies all music tastes plus its own playlists are awesome. I love its UI/UX which is very fluid and smooth.
Premium member. Can't change songs/pause from the lock screen anymore or via my car uconnect system. Used to be a great app but this lack of functionality is really ruining my experience as I primarily use spotify while driving. Incredibly disappointed.
the best music streaming app I've used. the UI could do with some tweaking because not everything is intuitive. 5 stars none the less. thanks Spotify!
"The most all inclusive music app that carries most versions/renditions of the music and more one would need. Build a library, listen offline and the quality is almost near the sound dynamics of Amazon."
The best music streaming apps out there! I love how they curate playlists specially suited to your music taste based on the types of songs you listen to it. Great sound quality too. Definitely recommend it! Plus you get a month's free membership for the premium version!
"god tier, best music app. not perfect but better than all others. i use this exclusively both on mobile and on pc. worst things abt this app is the limited social features and mediocre UI."
"i deleted the app originally on my phone because it took up so much data and space and i thought i could just get on my ipad instead and it would be ok but it turns out that spotify costs on apple so i got youtube music thinking that it would work just like spotify, if you go off the app it will still play but no thats a ""premium luxury"" on youtube music and so i got spotify again and im so glad it exists 5 stars!"
Great app.usar friendly and convenient.and the best thing is awesome streaming quality....just 1 request that don't ruin the app by advertise of something in between songs. This is best music app I have ever seen...
I've tried other similar apps but there's none better than spotify for me. It works because it's intuitive and it's intuitive because it works.
Awesome Music Experience with Sony Phone . Good set of Playlists. Auto Daily Mix. Attractive UI. Great thing is Sony Music Equalizer promptly giving variant sound for music lover. Loved Spotify.
"Only complaint is the repeat button is gone... please bring it back. I sleep to spotify playlists, and when they are over now, without that button, it stops and wakes me up."
"Best thing ever!!! But I would like more songs to be added in my region(India). A lot missing like that from Led Zappelin, David Gilmour,etc. And with that, it's quite slow even with a good network. Overall, it's awsome!"
phenomenal music application. Every verified artist is easily accessible. Hope they keep making updates and continue to find ways to make spotify even more intuitive.
"App works ok. It's great that track repeat button is back in album view üëçüëçüëç It would be great if it was possible to use downloaded music as alarm sound (without being connected to the internet, premium members of course). But I really don't know if this is spotify or android clock app issue."
"Simoly put, thr Spotify experience is one that is uncomplaining. It just works. it's got a much wider range ofusic compared to Apple music, and offers a much better and more efficient UI. The subscription is certainly worth it, and take into consideration the family bundle!"
"Incredible accuracy fun and easy to use. Note that ever since Apple bought Shazam and removed the link from shazam to Spotify, it requires an extra step to add a song to your Spotify list. Im so mad at Apple for forcing users to use only its music service, that im willing to take the extra step. Voice your right for having choices as a consummer: use Spotify!"
as an user i feel like listening with spotify for limited amount of time is good as after that all beats feels same. like other streaming apps it too has the drawback of becoming battery draining & feel somewhat its like data eating too. anyways still it can be done as good as for ios with time. multiple times it reezes and app closes automatically. but i love the app as i heard of the app quite a long in all youtube reviews. lets feel it little longer then only experience can be summarised.
"Spotify is a great app, but the only problem I have with it is that songs will play automatically, even when I haven't been on the app or touched any buttons or anything. And this mainly happens when I wake up in the morning. If there is any solution to fixing this, please let me know. But other than that, like I said, Spotify is an awesome app."
"Its just a solid app with a great user experience. I had no intention of keeping premium after my trial ended, but given the effort and extensive library I am going to have a hard time giving it up!"
"Amazing platform, absolutely no problems that stand out when one thinks, quite possibly one of the best music streaming apps out there."
amazing music application. Its having an Amazing UI. Music is avialable from a wide variety of collection. Playlists are so useful.
best music streaming service! the social aspect of it could use some work- I'm thinking messaging app within it. extensive library and intuitive radio/song selection algorithms are a big plus!
The entire music of our world is available instandly with just a push of a button. Amazing. Easy to handle and fun to use.
"well, spotify is a wonderful library of music and music is a lifetime of memories. just press a button and those good times come storming back. without music life would be awfully empty.so tune in and spotify will not disappoint you. guaranteed. p.s. ( send my residuals to ... just kidding )"
"Got all the music I ever wanted. Intuitive and beautiful design, look amazing on iPad, iPhone, Android and my apple watch. I can control music simultaneously on multiple devices!"
Current version 8.4.97.807 is probably the best one yet. Minor improvements to the UI and most importantly... the repeat button is back!
"Fantastic extras chosen by Spotify really hit the button, some of the artists I didnt even know and now they are an essential part of my playlist. Absolutely Fantastic."
This is the best music app undoubtedly. Suggestions it gives are amazing. UI is good. catalogue is very wide so ot never disappoints you.
love spotify! I wont use any other apps. spotify builds multiple daily mix playlists based on my listening habits and omg it is ALWAYS spot on. Iove that i can search songs and download songs for offline listening. best music app out there.
Great app for music. Clean UI. Great UX. Especially the Genius Behind the Lyrics integration makes music a lot more interesting. üëå
"i love spotify, but lately its been acting up i cant exit the app without the music continuing and its irritating. also the music either cuts off or doesnt play at all, im really just trying to enjoy my music but its not working right."
Spotify is the BEST app to listen to music on. All the songs that I like are there and can be played with the tap of a button!
I love having the ability to make playlists of my favourites past + present. There's a wide choice - even some quite obscure things.
"Excellent! Waiting for it to arrive in India! This is the best music streaming app out there! Most important to me is the availability accross all platforms: Android, iOS, Linux and Windows. Its functionality is consistent accross these platforms, too! The pricing in India is bang-on-target! I highly recommend it to anyone!"
"Ok, this stuff is one of the best out there. The presentation, user experience, casting options are simply phenomenal. I want the lyrics feature to be added the earliest."
"I like how there are curated playlists on the app for me, also I like the seamless and easy design of the app. There is a great range of music available from jazz, to meditation relaxing sounds, popular music and so forth, so far so good!"
"I can see why it is used the most out of all the music streaming apps over the world. The UI is simple, the streaming quality is good, so is the library. Only thing about Premium which breaks the deal is the pricing. In my region, there are really good steaming services with a good interface and catalogue as well. A little competitive pricing and partnership with some network service providers for discounted subscription would be great."
Love the app. Especially their playlists and music recommendations. Even the unpaid version's audio quality is quite decent. Way better than prime music or Saavn.
"A great app to listen to more music than you ever thought possible (including downloads for offline listening). The artist radio stations remind you of music you haven't heard in ages, or forgot about. Bonus points for a Linux desktop app too. If you're looking to add new features (developers), it would be handy to like/ favourite songs without having to unlock my phone. Too many layers of security and swiping (on modern phones) just to tick or heart a song."
I have found songs i havn't heard in ages. Also the generes i have selected provide great results. it is quite easy to use. Absolutely happy with the app and service as well.
"Best playlists, lots of content including songs, podcasts and much more with smooth and versatile UI as well as cross platform connectivity. You can just plug out earphones from your phone and plug into your PC and continue the same song from the same lyrics at any time."
I've been an avid user of Pandora for years but finally decided to actually try Spotify recently. I can comfortably say that I will be cancelling my subscription to Pandora. Spotify's service is robust and straightforward. The only thing I can hope for is stronger learning algorithms like Pandora's for music station building based on my tastes.
Best music app ever I've came across. Playlist sharing and UI is awesome. It has lots of features in pro version.
this is the kind of music library i was looking for. spotify surely learns the taste of our music and creates best suited playlist . I enjoyed the app to every minute. worth buying the subscription as well
"An amazing app for streaming and downloading music. I haven't experienced such personalised playlists and song recommendations in any other app so far. Plus, the user experience is top notch and different and I'm a big fan of the dark theme."
Great collection. One of the best music service I've used. Very clean and non intrusive UI. Only one gripe: even their Very High streaming quality is less than Gaana's HD quality. It is even more noticeable when using earphones.
"i been using this long time, and this is the best among others.. i like the layout design and the way they present the playlist and recommendations...easy to use .Only frustating to me was some of my favorite artist was no avail..especially the albums of tadao hayashi's FINGERTRIP. and older album of john kaizan neptune was no avail...please have it available..thank you"
it's soo good. I have no problems listening to music. I can hear high guality sound tracks and music! latest and new of all artists that I love. very fluid and responsive.It has clean and minimalistic interfere which look stunning. I love spotify and was waiting for it...
Everything is amazing thanks for the most waited launch in India UI is awesome please dont mess the UI with popuping regions unless the consumer follows like mostly every other apps screw this up im impressed with this UI i wanna do 5 start but for now 3 its not kinda disappoinment but little disappoinment . üòï Background play and lock sceen play should be there its a hightlight to the app .Anyway i love it ‚ù§
I love this! I run heavy equipment and it's nice to play whatever comes to mind or anytime. I'm so tired of the fm radio music all it does is play new songs repeatedly till its an over kill. Thumbs Up!
"Can't Imagine my day without Spotify! Clearly, it's the best application for music. It knows your taste, your likes, your dislikes. Plus you have these great playlists which can you listen to according to your mood and genre and the UI is amazing and so smooth! Thank you so much for getting this in INDIA. Have been waiting for it since long!"
The best music player. However I could suggest Spotify learn from Joox in term of song rankings and karaoke type lyrics. Quite hate it when you click top 50 songs in Malaysia but only International songs instead of mix with some local songs.
"the app is awesome, and love it all though for a premium user, im not happy that a downloaded playlist will not continue to play when offline, although it recognizes the last played song when paused, but it never plays how many ever times i press the play button, im pretty sure this is a very minute issue and can definitely be fixed easily, just felt thr need to inform you all and help improve the app"
"I been using spotify for a long time. Nearly for 4 years back when it didn't even launch in India. Illegally downloaded it and used along with a VPN. No doubt this is the best music streaming app amongst the ones available in today's market but it lacks a real big thing. A repeat button and a shuffle button. Please add that. Its not a big deal for your development team. You add those, I buy the premium. üòä"
"I love Spotify all around. It's a great service and app, which always works and has an intuitive design."
"Thank you for finally coming to India üáÆüá≥‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. Have wanted spotify for such a long time, i genuinely hate all the other music streaming platforms. Having used Apple music, amazon music and saavn i cant wait to use spotify. Have heard so much about the app from friends who have access to the app. Just hope that the subscription price is not too much otherwise spotify wouldn't be able to penetrate this market."
"I love the Daily Mix, though I could do without the bad German stuff. I can make playlists to suit my mood and whatever it is I'm doing, cooking, relaxing or gaming. Awesome app, well worth it to get Premium. Only I can't because I don't own a credit card and never will."
"worth it, a complete music app functions as it is built for.A way better than other dirt. Annoyed of not preferred albums at the top in other streaming apps."
"this app was fantastic but now whenever I try to change song in car via steering buttons, it just crashes and restarts. can you guys look into it? I have paid one time annual fee and this is happening constantly. just check if there is a fixable issue please. not rating bad cuz it seems like a technical issue."
"Spotify is the one! so fluid and seamless with regular updates providing more and more good stuff! Up to date songs every week, Thank you Spotify"
I can't find the repeat button or option anywhere in the app. Not even in the settings menu. I don't know if I'm the only one facing this issue or there's no song repeat option whatsoever. Kinda annoying.
"Excellent so far, and I'm finding it simple to use. I usually search for music but did find a playlist that really suits my tastes. Keep up the good work!"
"so far so good, haven't had any issues with this version. Simple and intuitive to use...makes going back to loading music manually onto the phone a chore"
"Spotify is legit. I just wish they'd quit removing songs from their servers. I'm sure its for copyright/plagiarizing purposes, but there arr so many cool songs that I have to download on my laptop, which sacrifices playing those tracks on mobile."
"I get access to all the latest songs in good quality. I personally feel like the steaming quality is a tad less than spotify-downloaded music which is subsequently less in quality compared to music played on your phone's default music player. The difference is quite negligible, but it'll irk the 5% of hardcore audiophiles out there. Also u dont get access to spotify-downloaded music on your stock music player, its stuck within the spotify app, thought u should know."
I wanted this app from a long time but the app was not available in some countries including India but thanks to you that this is available in India UI of the is superb and quality is awesome even the basic High quality is good iny opinion this is the best music streaming app.
"In India at long last, and I have to say, the autoplay (or song suggestion, whatever you want to call it) algorithm here has to be the best of any app I've used so far. For people like me who love streaming, this is the be all end all. It doesn't quite have every tune in the universe, though - I was amazed to find The Expanse's ost here but The Lord of the Rings has oddly gone missing."
"Spotify is my favorite app/product/service of any kind. Not only is it strong on the basics (massive music library, strong UX, ability to collaborate on playlists, etc) it also is amazing for podcasts and music discovery. Discover weekly, suggested playlist additions, curated playlists, etc all help find new music thatbreally works!"
"Its haven't even been 24 hours and i am loving it. its just launched in india and i am glad it did after a long wait. i have used many streaming service, Spotify is best in all of them User interface, app fluidity,stability, User friendly, easy to interect, huge library, best playlists (especially the 90's rock one), wireless mirroring directly to all the smart TV's, podcasts, Concert perfomances, everything you can possibly ask in a single music streaming service, Spotify have it. Loving it.üëçüëå"
Exceptional music app ever. It would be great if a alarm clock function can be built into it so that a song can be play while waking up in the morning / etc.
"So far so good, I'm enjoying this app quite much. I specially like the fact that I don't have to have a lot of my phone's memory space consumed by downloaded music. But I do wish that there was more variety options with the plans."
"WOW! I am just blown away by the wide variety of options present in here. I just moved here from sound cloud and woah, this app is GOLDEN. It has got sounds for the music lovers for all types of genres and the quality is unreal, yes! it's freaking amazing. The eq option is an option that I really missed in sound cloud but is present here. The UI is brilliantly clean although gestures would be a great addition, such as swipe up and down to switch between the home to the ""now playing"" menu."
Spotify is one of the best music applications which I have used till now. It is very responsive. It has all popular tracks. UI is also very nice.
"for me, ios spotify was much simple. I know they both similar but I can feel few differences like when I want to swipe down the song I have to use the button which is located at the top left, why can't Just swipe it down?"
Absolutely flawless UI. No issues downloading or streaming. Really useful to include audio quality settings and all the abilities to edit things.
Finally it's in India. Have been waiting for Spotify to launch in India for a long time now. Simply the best in music recommendations and the UI looks super sexy. I am in love with this app.
really great app for listening songs. I just love the quality of the songs and the app UI is really great. playlists are really so great. I like every part of it. I was waiting for it from a long time and now I'm so happy and satisfied.
amazing music app. found everything I was looking for in top quality streaming. downloads are quick and easy for offline mode listening as well. in spotify I trust!
I subscribe and pay like $13 ! month for a Spotify and Hulu combo pack.. love it.. couldn't be happier! There are some artists it doesn't have quite yet but most of today's music and most popular artists are there :) check it out!
"great, no issues, easy to use and relatively quick to download songs for offline mode on my phone. only glitch is sometimes my phone app doesn't sync with my laptop!"
"very clever playlists based upon my favorite musicians. also everything in the app works pretty well, with quick responses to everything, every comand, every request. congratulations!"
"Spotify is one of the absolute best music experiences on the market right now. I have used other services, which are good but Spotify is far more superior. The algorithm's it uses to build you playlists are amazing. Your music review they create for each account is fantastic. All around I give Spotify a solid 10/10 I'm quite happy with my service and will continue to be a solid promoter of it."
love the app and the podcast on there. great place to get all music and podcast for myself. what I think would be a good idea is a like and dislike button for podcasts. this way listeners can let the podcasts aware if users liked or disliked a certain episode.
"Great music app with ability to download songs, losts of songs and great reccommendations. would be great to have inbuilt feature for saving a song by listening to it, like shazam"
Not a lot of songs you can't find on here and picks up the music selection that suits your taste really fast. Love the discover weekly selection!
"i am sure the competition have similar libraries, the difference to me, is the intuitive-ness of spotify's application to monitor my music preferences thus, send me music recommendations based on what i listened."
best music app ever. This amazing app has allowed me to build a collection of music thats better than ive ever had in the past. its brought music back into my everyday life like never befire
"Spotify, especially Premium Family is perfect for any music lover! You can make so many music lists so that you always have exacty the music you need at the push of a button! Try it today!!!"
"first 5/5 I've given Spotify is so great. I can create playlists then after it finishes playing you have the option of it continuing playing music similar to those songs. it creates 5 different playlists, daily, with the songs you added that are similar genres with one or two new songs that are also similar. there's too much to praise them about."
One of the best music apps ever. Everything I want in music since my first Walkman in 1980. First thing I downloaded to my new phone. All we need is a recognition button.
"Reopens the door to decades of lost music. Very acceptable sound quality, especially if you tweak your equipment. Recommended."
"Simple and works great! Suggested small change: I think the settings button should be persistent across all sub menus and not only present in ""Your Library""."
love the fact I can have albums with the click of a button. great selection considering not a lot of the music I listen to is rereleased they still have plenty. only problem I really have is skipping. but that could be many things like bad phone or bad carrier. I love it
"did you actually remove the 'all songs added to library' tab? are you serious? i honestly don't understand why'd you do that, unless you want to make users hate you. please bring the tab back. i don't remember who made what song in which album (and those are, i'm quite certain, not the criteria by which people memorize the songs), and searching like that is extremely inefficient."
"LOVE Spotify ‚ù£‚ù£ especially since we have the family premium. perfect for our family of 5. No kids arguing over sharing an account. our 3 daughters,my husband and I have our own accounts and best of all much more songs available and more affordable then pandora. we were so limited with songs on pandora and the price not worth it plus each account had to be paid separately, no thank you. Spotify is the way to go üòçü§©"
AMAZING!!! I can listen to every song by Queen with a touch of a button. I absolutely love Spotify. I probably couldn't live without it.üòçüòä‚ù§üé∂üéß
"I love Spotify. The perfect music experience in an app. Excellent interface, great song suggestions based on your listening habits, and all around great design."
"really great experience with spotify!!!! I like that there are ads, but there aren't so many ads within playlists that ruin the whole experience!!!!!"
"Spotify is a pretty amazing app, i love using it and the way it connects to ur gaming systems and gives u so much qualtiy control from equalizer to file kbps rate is just awesome. I have premuim and really enjoy it."
"i love spotify this app has any song you like.For example, billie eillish,cumbia,hip hop different song and if u drive and hear music at the same time i promise it feels like a dream happening. for me it did. no adds but if u listen to one commercail u get 30 min of add free music and if u buy premium you can hear muisc when ur driving if u have no wifi its pretty cool. i honestly rate this 5 stars."
Honestly it's the best place to find high quality music. UI is easy to use and aesthetically pleasing! The free version of this app is hardcore bad though but I understand the need to make money so whatever. Good app.
Everything you need and more! The app is so fluid on any of my devices new and old. Spotify has been killing it for years and I will always continue to use it.
This is the equivalent of radio station that only plays the music you like. I have discovered a few new artists via their recommendations. Wouldn't be without now.
"We've been fans & a patron of Spotify for several years now. We're definitlely gratful for all this service offers, for patrons and artists. It's our underaranding that Spotify has earned little profit. If this is the case, acknowledging the reality that the business still exists and has grown over the years too offers testiment to the dedication of Spotifys founders to supporting the music industry from a place of valuing and appreciating the musical arts tremendously. üôè‚ú®üíöüå†"
Simple and minimalistic design! This music service is easy to use and is worth the monthly subscription! everything works perfectly and i rarely have issues.
"Never write reviews in Play Store. But with this app I'm really getting happier every week. Last months changes significantly improved music suggestion algorithms (or is it because I started to push like/dislike song more often) and already for around 6 weeks I genuinely enjoy at least 3/4th of the Discover Weekly playlist. Fresh music and endorphines every week! Thanks a lot for your work, guys!"
"Having been a paying member for like 4 or maybe more years now, (which since im a cheapskate I don't do lightly) i can honestly say spotify is probably the best music apps there is. It has great common sense to it in terms of user friendliness- basically it is really easy to do what you want in terms of finding, playing and organising songs etc. It seems like a lot of thought has gone into making the best user experience, and semi regular updates keep that true. Spotify is a real G."
"Very good music app. No hidden fees, ads are short and not frequent enough to ruin the musical experience. I highly recomend Spotify."
I've used Spotify since college. As an educator I really enjoy being able to quickly find songs appropriate to my lessons or to an ensemble performance. Highly recommended.
The features are very intuitive and surprisingly helpful. Seeking the next song loads very fast. Very enjoyable to use.
"love the dark theme, nice and intuitive to use. my one criticism is just that you're unable to swipe on a song to the right to queue it on android, like i could on my old iphone. would love to see that feature integrated on android as well :)"
"Honestly for me as a developer who uses many platforms i love the fact you can seemlessly sync your current song across EVERY. SINGLE. OPERATING SYSTEM. they not only have linux snap but also a snazzy web app. works great on wear OS and windows and those icky apple things too. Oh it sounds excellent too, and i havent been able to find an artist yet!"
"Came back from Amazon Music as the UI is slicker, works better with Android auto and is more compatible with smart home hubs. Also better features. Now have family plan too. Flawless performance. Quite happy."
"Good quality music, however if you do not have premium it does use up a lot of data. Also it is quite hard to find playlists."
"excellent streaming app! perfect for anything, and everything music-related. all songs, all genres, all of it is available on spotify!! graphics display, info, personalization are all welcome bonuses. overall, pretty near perfect!!! so easy to use, and i deff recommend downloading :))"
Best music app ever designed. Low bandwidth high quality sound... Would be nice to have video on it. Ideal car cars. Better than any radio station
"I absolutely love spotify. You can't beat $10 a month for what you get. Music is great. UI is great. They make Pandora and Serius XM look like a waste of money. I can't wait to see Spotify more heavily embedded in things like car audio, because it is about all I listen to."
"great app, but in my opinion, needs a ""quick add to playlist"" button where it auto adds the song to a playlist set up previous, so if you press the button it doesnt take you to the ""select a playlist"" page"
"I really like this application. It's not quite as nice as the PC client, but it still gives a good experience. And $10 per month for all the music I love with no ads is a great price."
Really love Spotify. Super easy to find the music I like. The app offers good recommendations also. Tried Amazon music but quickly came back to Spotify. Plus they gave me a free Google mini.
Have been using Spotify for a couple weeks now. So great! Love the curated playlists and how it becomes more intuitive as I keep interacting. It would be awesome if you could get song lyrics as you're listening (and singing along!)
Great service with a lot of flexibility compared to other streaming services and large amount of devices support it which gives you more use out of this service and has great quality music. The user experience is excellent at most with small features to help the user save data if on a mobile plan.
"being old school with music delivery and never having a device suitable for download etc I had not really explored Spotify. best Christmas present ever is my new tablet, having a week off work, I discovered that my favourite radio station has the one play list on repeat day in day out. SPOTIFY HAS OPENED MY EYES, choice and control and some excellent memories are reignited! I love it!"
"Like to listen to a wide variety of music, spotify is the ticket, simple,straight forward in the process, fexible in building different playlist, and choices are a plenty! well done spotify take a bow! üòâ‚úå"
This is the most amazing app ever. The playlist they build basd on the songs you listen to is the fantastic. I havent heard a song I dont like on this app in like three months. Whoever created Spotify created a masterpiece Thankyou
"Intuitive, great library selections and suggestions. Great user interface. Seemlessy play across devices around my home. Big ups for Spotify"
"I love the fact I can use this app and still use my phone to cruise the net, answer texts or schedule appointments on my calendar while it plays in the back ground on my wifi sound system."
"I was really anti Spotify for a while, having to pay for the privilege of listening to music I already have. Just went premium for 99p and it's completely blowing my mind. I'm discovering music every day, the interface is really intuitive, and saving music kind of feels like I'm keeping it. Game changer..."
"Oh man! I hate always choosing songs to play. With spotify, I just give them my type of music and I trust them in choosing the songs that suits my genre. üòâüéß"
I've used this app almost daily for over 2 years to build personal playlists and keep up with new album releases. The song recommendations have kept every day fresh and given me so many more artists to love. I have no idea how I lived without it before >‚àÜ<
I really love this app it is a easiest way to listen to music!! Ive traveled to many places and was still able to play the music I love!! I really reccomend spotify premuim as well it is a big help!
i absolutely love this service and its app. It runs smoothly and rarely glitches. It's a great way to build playlists and fibd new songs and artists.
I really like this app I can play my own music and create my playlist with many different artists. I just love the option of playing from my phone to my tv with just a push of the button
"Very intuitive and easy to use, I can't believe I am only just using it now. Limitless collection, including international songs too!"
"Reliable when casting, good UI, easy to sample / listen to both new and old music and good value for money. What's not to like?"
"Great app. I'd like big buttons for playing an album (replacing the queue) or adding it to the queue when browsing an album, same for a playlist when browsing a playlist. Right now there's a lot of deleting of individual tracks when deciding to listen to another album."
Offers a great selection of music to suite for most people's interests. Very intuitive and beautiful app design. Love it!
Love that I can find my favourite songs and build them in my customized playlist. Being able to listen to them offline was a great feature.
"It's all good but there needs to be a shuffle button on the queue screen like it is on iOS. Hate going to my queue, checking the upcoming songs out, going back and pressing the shuffle button off and on, then checking the queue again. and repeating til I find a good order. Ya know?"
"Love spotify, never any issues and good value! Easy to use, I can listen to all my favourite music at the press of a button, love making playlists as well! üëçüéµüëå"
"Spotify offers a really good range of playlists tailored to my tastes from a broad range of artists that I'd never even heard of and provides quite a good representation, though not exhautive of what I like from progressive rock. It can get me everything I want but always offers a good range of music that I am actually very happy with especially for study and sleep."
Great variety of songs to choose from. Accurate recommendations. Only critique is that finding podcasts to play/download is difficult. The UI is overall very easy to navigate.
"LOVE this app! Any song I can think of, Spotify has it. I can quickly download, create a playlist, and then relax and listen for hours! 5 stars definitely!!!"
"Best streaming service, app needs to mature somewhat. Browsing music is not as intuitive as it should be. Love being able to send my mudic to different devices in the house."
Love it!! had pandora but its annoying that i could never just search and listen to one song. spotify i can search for a particular song and build custom playlists of songs i want and from recommendations from spotify!!
"Cleanest UI, most complete collection of music, and most enjoyable music subscription service I've used, and I've used Amazon Music, Google Play Music, and YouTube Music."
"Really like the built in playlists based off music genre, activity, etc. and the option to create your own. All positive experience so far."
The app getting stuck in offline mode has been an existing issue for over 2 years now. Spotify has STILL not resolved this issue that CONSTANTLY happens where even with wifi and signal your app will get stuck in offline mode. Simply adding a function button saying 'Go Online' would fix this but NOPE. The 30bil market cap company can't figure it out. I'm days from selling my stock and switching to Apple. This is ridiculous.
Spotify is a great app and I reckon everyone will love all the cool features as well as the app itself. The only things that needs improvement would be the downloading be cause it can be quite slow at times and the details on the songs. Apart from those the app is awesome and if ur thinkig of getting it I would recommend it for sure!
"Everything I wanted and more. Building playlists, experiencing new music are both excellent. Well done navigation. Excellent sound quality. Highly recommend."
"all the ads are incredibly annoying and completely ruin the experience, until you buy spotify premium. That was the best app purchase I've ever made and I use spotify constantly now. Love it! - I know that sounds like an advertisement, but seriously, if you like music, just do it."
spotify is the best music app ever. it is free for all listeners and there's no subscription required. although if you do want to pay you can get offline music and a lot of other benefits.
"It's really nice and I would really want to advice everyone to go for premium. You can listen to music even without an internet connection and the downloads are not a problem. Before everything else, I think the best part about Spotify is that it's legal. You can listen to your favorite artists guilt free, knowing at the back of your mind that your helping them as well."
"Amazing, no matter what you require and whoever music wise spotify is without doubt the best app out there...with lyrics and the history behind the artist aswell its sure brilliant.."
"I actually quite enjoy Spotify! I use it both on my phone, game console, and computer! I just wish it wasn't so expensive to use Premium, especially since I'm on a budget. I only pay for it, because I hate ads in after every other song."
Love it! Easy interface and lovely design. Would recommend to anyone who loves organization and appealing visuals. Very cheap as well.
"Awesome app for music, especially since they offer a student discount with hulu included. Just wish they let you add a whole playlist into another playlist and made sorting them easier, the recent update ruined the navigation"
Its really good for new albums and music and if you don't want to have some adds in your music check out the quick add for thirty minuets also if you don't have the time to listen to Spotify check out amazon music its just as goodüëçüëçüëç
"It's better than play music because, I can just push the song I want and just plays instantly but , I have to push the play button over and over on Google play music and that's why I like spotify."
"Love this app with my heart especially as a student with the 4.99 discount that includes premium, showtime, and Hulu. My only complaint atm is that you guys removed the filter button at the top of a playlist so now I have to go to the menu to choose the find in playlist button which is just super annoying."
"The free user experience: The ""FREE"" version is usually one of the most unsatisfying experience of any given paid app,I need not to explain further. In Spotify's case, it's one of the fairest experiences with other music apps I have ever encountered. It gives enough freedom to do things you would ever need and has mini demos for the premium version. The paid user experience: Hands down one of the best premium music streaming service ever. HIGHLY recommend for those who love to listen to mainstream songs. Customer supoort: I have never in my entirety on this good flat planet received better or even rmotely close to the Spotify customer support. Honestly one of the best things about Spotify. TL;DR: 10/10"
"Spotify is the best music platform, in my opinion. They put a lot of effort into playlist that suit your tastes, and spotfiy premium downloading is smooth. :)"
"Spotify is excellent. Almost all the songs are here..and knows what a person what music suits best for them...payment wise, i hope we could pay easily with our load account. Thanks and more power!"
"My app of choice for music. Aside from a few of the benefits from having a subscription, it's got a decent UI and innate dark mode. Great selection of music, probably one of the better mainstream services for finding SOME obscure songs, but definitely not all."
"its the best music player hands down i have been using this on every platform i have , PC,xbox,mobile they all work the same with just the difference of the interface which is ok and i love the dark and green theme it suits me as a dark theme guy and just the amount of songs in spotify's music library is by far the largest i have experienced and they have got every official release in as soon as it comes out i would just ask to add more unofficial songs like some remixes of some songs aren't present but that's only 3% of my music so it wouldn't annoy anybody overall thanks Spotify for such a great service"
I just really started using it today so I can't really say as far as recommendations it wouldn't be able to give me any yet probably but I really love all the selections that I have in unable to experience new music at the touch of a button.
"If there was an Application Mount Rushmore, Spotify would be all 4 heads, and they would currently be sculpting a fifth just to put them in there again. No app will ever live up the majesty, efficiency, altruistic, and benevelonce that this app provides. Using any other music streaming app is not only a disservice to yourself, but to the greater good of the music loving world."
I love using Spotify and have for a while a now. I've noticed that the search tab at the top of the playlists is gone though and I'd really like to have it back. Having to take that extra step to search for the button to search a song seems a bit much.
A quick tutorial option would be great. A visual guide that remains active if you want it for those a little technological impaired üòÇ
Have been using it for years and I really love it! Its so easy to build playlists and i especially like the download option. Its really great for long car rides or any place you may go that dosent have the greatest wifi or data connection.
"A great way to stream all your favorite music! The new update looks quite appealing, and the student discount makes this a great value for students to listen to music while studying or anything else!"
"Spotify is a great service, whether you have a premium account or are listening free. While it doesn't feature *every* artist, it features a heck of a lot, whether you're a fan of pop or more underground artists. I have had no difficulties finding my favorite performers, and Spotify's even turned me on to quite a few I'd never heard of before, like The Cog is Dead. They've also got a ton of great podcasts like NoSleep, Scary Stories Told in the Dark, and We're Alive. Seriously, Spotify's damn good stuff."
"Best music app overall, have tried quite a few but this is the best one yet. Perfect layout easy to use very simple. So much music of all kinds. Even discovered artist I've never heard of. Best music app love it!!! Would give 10 stars of I could."
"I like the app and been a premium subscriber. I like how I used to be able to sort a playlist very quickly with 1 button, but recent updates make it that I have to click on the three dots, scroll down then click sort. Please bring it back to the fast and easy way"
Everything I'm looking for in a premium music streaming app except lyrics and 2 buttons (one for fast-forward 10 seconds and the other to rewind 10 seconds)
The best music streaming app. You can find basically any song you could think of. It's extremely quick and the quality Is perfect. Amazing.
Quick and simple to navigate. Downloading is a great option for when offline. Enriching the holiday experience!
I am so impressed with spotify. I love that there are zero interruptions. I can quickly load the queue list with my favorite songs.
"Would prefer the interface to be a bit more fluid, like that of the IOS version where you can swipe to add songs to queue etc. But apart from that it's perfect üíú"
"Spotify is my best companion. Love the usability, the intuitive interface, the overwhelming music offer and the customised approach which package music according to my tastes, listening habits and preferences. It's just great!"
"Spotify is an amazing app if you like listening to music and creating custom playlists. With the click of a button, you can download your music and listen to it anywhere. Spotify has a wide variety and many genres of music. Overall it's a great app! Definitely recommend :)"
"Most reliable, intelligent designed and easy usable streaming service out there. Premium is worth every penny. As for the android app itself, it uses minimal resources and can be used as a remote for other logged in Spotify instances, supports SD card downloads and is all together very intuitively designed without losing the possibility of detailed configuration and edits to your playlist."
"Great song suggestions, love checking my discover weekly every Monday. Used to have some GUI issues, but this past year's updates have really improved the interface. Wish every artist would put their songs on Spotify!"
"This app has changed. my whole listening habit .l can listen to all music I tried to listen to on the light programme , home service and. Luxembourg, nearly 70years ago.Absolutely great .Thanks"
This app is awsome ..iv used dezzer always .and Amazon'.however prefer the old Spotify now my self ..also produce music my self and design sounds and samples so will be hitting Spotify with them real soon lol. Thanks guys for excellent service cheers
"Can you make purchases available via phone balance with phone porviders in Saudia Arabia? This feature is already used and applied in other applications. I know many friends and family and other people who don't own a dept card or a visa that would love to have this feature so they and myself could enjoy the amazing premium features and its luxury. Please take this in to consideration, much appreciated."
"Great selection of artists. Quite good at guessing what I'll like. There's ads, but fewer than on the radio, so they don't bother me all that much."
I love Spotify. Been using it consistently for over a year and it's given me nothing but great music. The algorithms it uses to recommend new music suited to me are very accurate
"PRO: Perfect for variety, Larin dance and yoga classes I teach. Can make several playlists, can set the space or time between songs, can set up a on the spot playlist with queuing. I upgraded to Premium because of my regular need. It is sooo worth it and cheap. CON: 2018 songs are late in being available."
"Well designed, fairly minimal unnecessary notifications (ads). Content is good, although the Spotify recommendation engine doesn't seem to be as good as Pandora."
"Love how Spotify manages playlist and the latest recommendation of the songs really good, the simple UI makes it easy to use . Keep make it better"
"Ive been with Spotify premium for 3 years now! Love it to bits! Especially that it includes an equilizer which other apps or subscriptions do not (apple music, Google Play music)"
Awesome app. Can find any music quick and easy. Makes terrific playlists for you as well. Someone put together an incredible algorithm to pull thos all together.
"Spotify premium is great! I get it half price as I'm a student. I love all the playlists I can make as it suits my needs like walking to uni, or working out at the gym."
"Great app, although the latest update removed the feature where I could double tap the search button and start typing. Now I have to press search, then tap the actual search bar at the top, then type. Seems minute, but it's the little things ya feel me?"
"This app is intuitive, convenient, and has such a wide range of music and podcasts, that it's addictive as well."
"Way better than Apple Music, this gives users the chance to understand what they are buying. It offers a variety of music, unparalleled UI and famously drafted playlists that can relate to a users past experiences. All in all, a terrific app,and I would highly recommend purchasing premium."
I think every one should get this app even though it has some adds it is not that bad and you can pick more music if you want and if you don't like a song you can just press the button that has the line going through so I give this app a 10 out of 10 what do you guys give this app
"BIG love for this app!! I paid for premium version straight up and because I'm with Optus I get free music streaming with Spotify so it is absolutely awesome. I love that it shows you similar bands to the ones in your playlists. Can't rate this app high enough! So worth premium.. no adds and you get the luxury of downloading songs within the app for offline use. My kids and I listen to this all day every day, it's even got playlists for my toddler and baby. So worth it!"
"Spotify has all the music anybody could want, the the intuitive ability to suggest artists that may make you a new fan. I've broadened my list of music I enjoy with Spotify greatly over the past 3 or so years."
I use Spotify daily and absolutely love having access to the millions of songs available. The interface is great and it's easy to get to songs that I'm looking for quickly.
"The content is great, design intuitive, and I love being able to explore so many diverse genres of music."
"This is a great music streaming app. Although, without premuim, you are pretty limited, so that temped me to purchase it. And it is TOTALY worth it. With premuim, this is the best music streaming app out there. I HIGHLY RECOMEND SPOTIFY (premuim)"
Spotify premium is the best music platform. Easiest to organise your own way but also intuitive to your music tastes. The best selection of music out there is spotify premium.
Great for making exact paylists. Great for finding stations to find new related music. Cool suggestions. Good selection of chip tunes. More intuitive than Pandora.
Great music selection and auto adds to playlist in library. It's never difficult to find music to suit your mood.
Just subscribed to premium. It's good. Music is all in high quality even though I listen through a cheap headphone haha.. And the download is fast too. My complains is you should have settings to play only songs in search results in Playlist. And also let user skip song in the Playlist ui. Just my suggestions. üòäüòä
"Spotify is my number one go to when listening to music on the Aux, its low data and battery usage make it an excellent way to blast tunes without having to worry about anything."
"I've only been using Spotify for a short time, however I do like the app quite a bit the ads aren't too long and the selections the song is pretty great for the most part. There's some older stuff or obscure stuff that's harder to find but still good."
"I've had Spotify for quite some time now and although the free version has ads the paid one does not and it's worth every penny, huge database and great music ""intuition"". Thanks guys!"
"Best Music streaming app. Some less known artists or certain albums are still missing but most things are there. Also missing some features, I would like a ""party mode"" where you can either lock it completely without entering password or allow quing but not changing playlist without the password. A feature to que playlists and/or temporarily combine playlists would also be cool."
"Honestly I've been using spotify since the OG Rogers phone deal you could get a few years back and I haven't looked back since. Library has pretty much anything you need besides some underground stuff from like Soundcloud and the UI has done nothing but improve. Only real change I'd like to see in the future is maybe a way to view listening stats in the app with more stats being recorded than currently available. All in all the only music app I'll ever pay for, you have my loyalty spotify"
"It is lack of plenty of the most on-trend Chinese, and other songs. It also requires Premium account to unlock its worthiness. However, it can be a good application if it's opened to the Chinese country. I'll cause it to be a great platform with great amount of conveniences and lifestyle."
"Spotify on Android is a seamless, fluid pleasure that pumps music into my ears on demand. Connects flawlessly to all my devices, regardless of whether it's the car, Xbox, or Bluetooth speakers. The ability to download music and podcasts for offline listening makes for soothing and relaxing commutes."
"'New to this app. but V. impressed so far,. Pretty good shuffle lists with searched songs and quick results. 9.9/10. (Well Nothing's Perfect! ;-) ...... Is it?) ‚≠ê"
My favorite music app hands down! Love love love it! Never crashes and I find lots of new music to love. Make playlists to suit your moods or enter a mood or genre and find music to suit you. Perfect!
I do quite enjoy this app. I am able to find playlists for all sorts of moods. But I would wish we had the option where we can play songs from all the artists that we have as our favorite. It was alot easier to go to when I didn't know what I felt like listening to.
"Amazing, we use it pretty much everyday, music to suit everyones needs, our 2 year old loves the playlist I have made her, I listen to podcasts when doing house work and lately I have been obsessed with the beautiful piano playlists while cooking,showing and studying üëå"
I have been very pleased with Spotify since I went with their premium package. Before that there were too many ads which I guess served the purpose it was designed for and that is to aggravate me so much it would inspire me to invest in the premium package. Good app.
My most used app. Great design and the discovery playlists are great. Wish lyrics could be done in house but musixmatch is fine for now.
"Very powerful, full-featured app particularly amenable to genre and title tailoring as well as playlist development to suit the taste of every discriminating listener/user."
Many new songs featured in Spotify compared with other apps. My best company during alone time. Always enjoying it to the max. The only down thing is it quite pricy for the premium future.
It's perfect It has all the weird fringe rock and nu metal I love. Plus it pairs me up with tons of new stuff based on the good older rock It's easy to use It builds workout mixes for me around my music preferences And it gives you all your music based on a playlist so you can like songs or dislike them after you've gotten a chance to listen to them without breaking pace
"Perfect to use anywhere! What I love best is when I browse other apps, Spotify continues playing...unless I close the app or press the ""pause"" button."
"First time i am actually reviewing. Its convenient, well designed, and completely worth the modest price. No more using youtube for music."
"The ads is quite annoying (free user) which i think its effective to get subscriptions. Tried to subscribe but had some issues with the payment. Other than that, great app!"
"So far very good. Sometimes while listening, abrupted by portions of another music & this ruins listening to the music of my choice. These are sudden interruptions which occurs depending on the music - like listening fragments of 2 songs simultaneously. Can't complain since it's free app."
"App is great! I listen music all the time! Only problem I have is that if I'm using another app, it'll act as if Spotify isn't open and won't show what song is playing but it'll play the song. Quite annoying, but other than that it's wonderful!"
"A very good app where you can access all of your favourite songs whenever you like. All of this, in the touch of a button. AMAZING app"
"Spotify is my new goto for all music from yesteryear to modern, the search is quick and direct. and the algorithm for recommendations is pretty good too and will only improve i believe, great app guys!"
"Easy UI, convenient and can listen songs even when offline. Looking for more songs and artists. Some of them not in the list."
"Great app, recently had some difficulty with it but support@spotify had it sorted in minutes üëç Have come across some great new music thanks to playlists designed based on what I listen to."
"It's Spotify. It has lots of good music. The UI could be dialed in a bit with Chromecast, but I don't know any other complaints about the app."
"Absolutely the BEST music app out there! Spotify wins my vote, hands down! And the premium version is most definitely worth the small monthly fee. You have the ability to build as many playlists as your heart desires and its ad free. Plus the variety is astounding!"
"Yo I do love Spotify which is why I'm rating it as a 5, but for some reason theres now an older version of Spotify on this store? You can tell because the logo is using an older, less ""flat"" design and it's missing tons of features. It's kinda funny that some people haven't clocked on it's the wrong version haha. Either way you can get the latest ver on the Amazon store - so don't fret too much people."
Really good for customizing and making a playlist that has only your favorite songs. I think it allows quite a few skips on a playlist.
"Nice app for listening to music. Has a wide variety, and cool features like music queuing, and getting to see what my friends are listening."
Brilliant application! Great place for finding all your popular music ! Can be quite pricey but I'd recommend getting student discount ! You pay ¬£ 99 for the first 3 months then afterwards you pay only ¬£4.99 per month !!
"Spotify is great! I love the app, it's got a great UI and almost all the features of the browser version."
"I love that Spotify finds new music for me. I used to have to go to a club, or hope to get lucky on youtube. It has a hard time distinguishing between industrial and metal, though."
I think it's pretty good not thtavgreat guilty but it's good enough to listen and also where u can listen to music without Wi-Fi it would be 10 times better for be honest I still think it's pretty amazing though keep up the great worküòÅ
Over the last 4 years spotify has been my go to app for music. I couldn't be without it! It has hiccups every now and then but they are quickly fixed and it is a seamless application.
"App has a gr8 selection of off--beat alt jazz & classical as well as 60's/70's/big hair. $ is right. Never have issues with access, sound is gr8, site is easy to navigate. HOWEVER, site caters to the millenial crowd. There are other demographics with wallets. The AI Spot uses for song recommendations based upon my musical preferences isn't even close in most instances. I pay no attn to the social side of the site . Social is sooo 20 minutes ago LOL."
Great app. Always has the music you are looking for and everything is free. The only downfall is that it does require a connection unless you have premium. The premium is a great deal for a lot! Definently reccomend this for your music entertainment.
"I think Spotify is a great app for music, I have used Spotify for quite a while now and it's great to find the perfect music your looking for!"
The app itself is amazing! Very intuitive and great overall experience. Support team also very attentive and quick.
"I use spotify constantly. So incredibly well designed and easy to use, 100% recommend to anyone and everyone."
"Been using it for years! Easy to use, intuitive, clever! Love starting radios from tunes particularly, always learning about new artists a'la Pandora!"
"Tried all the music apps and this is by far the best and always has.been, links to tripple J app (Australian radio) and you can add the songs wherever you like, links with Sonos and Google home. Used to spend at least 80 quid a month on music and now a small price of 9.99 gets me all and more , honestly can not rate it enough."
"recommended by a friend, love it! room for improvement : a designated folder for downloaded songs for easy access when no data üòÅ"
Very easy to use stays playing music when screen is off so it can save battery and time easy playlist builder and millions of songs not just mainstream songs you hear on the radio.
"I have recently started using this app and it totally transformed the way I now listen to music, building playlist is smoothe and effortless, work simultaneously with my GPS driving app, I love spotify...simply the best..!"
Spotify is an excellent way to compile playlists and find new artists. I've built up a solid group of artists in my daily listening. If you're looking for a clean and easy way to find music spotify is the way to go
Seriously the easiest way to listen to music. Listen to your favourites (and they'll be there don't worry) and you'll end up with suggestions that are pretty well matched with the stuff you like. I've found so many little known artists that I've fallen in love with and I wouldn't have known they existed otherwise. Worth the ten bucks a month!!! The app is intuitive and comprehensive. Recommended
"Game changer! Thank you. Only thing I miss that YouTube has is finding really fresh quirky new music - BBC Radio 6 promoted tracks for example. Outside of that awesome. Also or me I have a good few similar style playlists, I'd love to be able to have control to add certain playlists together. Last thing promise which might sound a bit mad is curating your saved music by tempo - so for example its 5pm on a Saturday and youre preping food followed by friends arriving, then after food drinks begin to flow it's now 11pm and getting ready to hit the road to a bar etc. The tempo for me starts slow then gradually picks up - a lot of us will manually change playlists from chill to medium to upbeat. It would be so cool if I could pick a wave length and set a time frame for how that wave length/tempo change pans out. Its like a personal DJ where you decide if youre going down the rabbit hole or not and how quickly. Anyways love Spotify just as it is also - food for thought ‚úå"
"As intuitive as can be, although synchronisation of settings between mobile and desktop devices can be improved (ie show last played consistently between either, private session on all devices running an account when activated)"
I've been with Pandora almost since their conception. The Spotify algorithms are as good or better. Loving it so far...found quite a few of my new favorite songs.
"Spotify has been a game changer for my life. All the music and podcasts I'd every want to listen to, in a great intuitive platform. Love it."
"I've tried all the streaming services and this one is by far the best. The player is superb, it does it all, good eq, crossfade and volume levelling across tracks. Easy to use, the playlists are intuitive and the library has pretty much everything."
No UI or battery issues to report. Seems to compress data well as my data usage isn't that high considering I use this app a lot in my car and on the move.
Spotify playlists are great and you can also make your own playlist to suit the occasion. Spotify is the best thing created for music lovers!
I have to give it up for the wicked awesome customer service. They're quick and ready to take action and help you in every way with the coolest attitudes! üòÑ I've been using Spotify for 4 years at least! Love it! Keep on rockin! (That's what they said hehe) ü§òüòé
"Great idea this app was. I just hope it becomes ubiquitous and universal, so that it could become the musical library of the world. Awesome, considering the offline mode."
"Great music app. Great design, easy to find what you're looking for. We'll priced subscription model. I use Spotify at home, at work for music and during my commute for podcasts that I can listen to offline."
I quite enjoy Spotify since I have been using it for quite some time now. It is definitely my main and favorite music app/source. I have been pleased with it overall.
Awesome ! Having all the music in the world at my finger tips is incredible ! App has great recommendations and is very intuitive too ! Love it!
"Spotify has allowed me to step back into my youth and re-discover all the bands and artists that guided my interest in music. Its all there, simply search,press and enjoy."
"Discovering new or classic music has never been easier. You can save songs and make your own playlists or listen to ,,radio'' based on a song you like or an artist. Of course the commercials ruin everything but you can get rid of them with 6euros a month. Plus you have one month trial without commercials before deciding or not to pay."
"One of the beat music apps I've ever had. So convenient, love my recommended music/podcasts and easy to build/share playlists. Perf"
"I've used Spotify for many years. And even though it has some bugs, it's still great in comparison to other music streaming services. Love how I can take music offline and get playlists made for me from music I like. Can easily find the music fit for the occasion through User and Spotify made playlists, and make ones myself. Easy to use and great GUI. 5 stars and easily worth the money for premium."
The sound quality is superb when streaming over quality equipment. Spotify stays in the lane with a selection much better than other streaming apps.
"Love Spotify and its intuition by playing songs related to the ones I play at the beginning lf my session. I'm just obsessed and I keep recommending it to everyone. Though, it should try to get more Asian music and instrumental."
"Very intuitive, very often the song you seach for starts playing immediately... Advertisment to song play time ratio is reasonable in my opinion... Great app!! And I rarely find apps that I would recommend!"
"Zero complaints. However, Spotify should help us differentiate between playlists and stations, and should add a like/unlike button in the playlists, as also allow the user to unlike a previously or accidentally liked song."
"Fantastically Amazing, not sure about your pre made playlist, I did not like them, mine are fine .Need more original copy not (ie not deluxe or remastered )but over all very good thank you !!!!"
I like this app because you cam listem to all songs without downloading them and yoi can also find you genres that you didn't listen to before. If you're using something like the family thingy it's also quite cheap. It's also great for students.
"Been using Spotify for a few months now. Haven't had a single problem so far! Very clean-looking UI, has a great majority of music I listen to, and is very high quality! If you are looking for a music app, I'd recommend spotify over all else."
"Spotify delivers solid back-end performance, meaning, the AI working in the background builds solid playlists.. BUT, to find them, don't listen to the first choices, dig a little deeper by going to the higher numbered lists (like Daily Mix 6), and you will be rewarded.Go to Artist Radio from there and you will be rewarded further with the more eclectic gems.. Enjoy.."
Customer service is amazing. Great access and very easy to build playlists. Very consistent quality music. Just love it.
"Great app. The recurrent ads are pretty annoying and intrusive. Not as bad as pandora though, but still frequent enough to be a nuisance."
I absolutely love this music streaming service. I've been using it for years. The free version of the app gives you a good taste of whether or not you would enjoy premium although you get bombarded by ads for premium quite frequently. Nevertheless I highly recommend this app to anybody that is a music lover like myself.
"Even though I am not using the premium version, the app is very good and, unlike many other apps, does not require the premium to be used enjoyably. I recommended it to all of my friends who are not using it and soon enough I'm planning on buying premium."
"Spotify is super easy to use, the layout is intuitive so it's easy to browse and/or search. The music playlists and recommendations are quite good... maybe not what I want 100% of the time but better than any other app I've used. I pay for a subscription but to me, it's totally worth the investment if you have a huge love of non mainstream music especially. Totally recommend!"
"Love it. I build my play lists, that I can download, and listen to even when I'm offline. It's an endless source of music and really comfortable to use."
"This app is nice if you want to listen music. Especially if you have the premuim, you can download music and listen where ever you want without wifi, and its free for 1 month then you pay!"
"Love how this app will suggest new music based on what I've chosen to listen to. Also, love that Spotify has podcasts! It helps make my work day go by so quickly."
"Great app, great design, easy to use, awesome deals for students. Only thing is that the app will crash occasionally on my Samsung Galaxy S8- I'm not the only one with this issue so it seems like it is unique to the S8"
"I'm extremely happy with Spotify. I was concerned I would spend fruitless hours trying to making it compatible with my music devices, happily I have to keep telling it to stop connecting to everything that plays! Well done, it's great not having to use iTunes. (the you need a. Degree in computer science to use)"
"This algorithm is fantastic. Not only that, it's very fast and the recs come quick and consistent. Outstanding. Worth every penny."
Awesomeness! Pick ur playlist by selecting artists and songs you like build ur favorite songs up keeps track of your style of music suggests amazing other music in daily tracks menu. One commercial every 30 and 10 skips an hour but after that it's amazing for free. If you can afford premium then you're muck Better off still amazing for free too. Get it now!!!!!!!!!!!
"The Android app for Spotify is a pretty solid experience on the Huawei P20 Pro. The UI is very good for both looks and use. Audio quality options are nice for adapting to different bandwidth/storage scenarios. Of course, the service is missing the social aspects of great predecessors (RIP rdio), but you can still share tracks through other apps or SMS."
Pro version definitely worth it - gives you great music quality. I'm using Spotify to rebuild my iPod library. Apple is way too greedy as far as I'm concerned especially since I primarily use a PC or android ph9ne for music. I can't find every song from my iTunes but the majority are there.
I wish I could rearrange songs and they got rid of the stupid shuffle play button. Makes it impossible to organize because it scrambles everything. At least be able to turn the thing off.
"It's really good to have an spotify premium account, but still there are some playback bugs and the UI is getting old and boring and the lyrics are not lyrics but they are stories from genius."
"Good app, I spend loads of time on it. I don't mind the ads. Good range of music choices. Please add a button to see how many minutes of music you've listened to that day / week / month!"
"It's pretty good. I was using the free version for quite a while, until my brother got me a gift card for three months of Premium. I've downloaded sooOOOOOOOOOoooo much music for offline listening now and I'm spoiled with the unlimited skips, so I'm gonna be just fine with paying for it once the gift card runs out. 9/10 let's get the SleepyCabin Podcast on here"
"First app I've used to purchase music beyond iTunes. I've lost touch of keeping my music organized and up to date with since the demise of free music software, so hoping I can build a new permanent accessible library with Spotify's technology."
"I've not yet been unhappy with it. Reacts strangely with my LG phone as far as will quit playing randomly, but i believe that is more about the processing power of the phone. Great app!"
"More intuitive to interact with and and more correctly intuitive digital dj decision equations. A wider and deeper variety of music than most, simply the best.."
I love the ability to control what I listen to and build custom playlist that suit any occasion. Keep it up Spotify!
"A simply amazing app! Runs great, easy to use UI, incredible music quality. The best way to enjoy your favorite songs, whichever genre or artist they might be from."
"I love this app. Let's cut the bull poop, the Spotify, Pandora and YouTube music users are more divided than America on the presidency. I prefer Spotify even though they all work the same, and the main difference is the UI. DOWNLOAD THIS APP"
Super user experience. Able to play on one device and control playback with another. Seamless transfer from one device to another.
I'm a spotifyholic. Excellent platform. Once in a while it doesn't quickly pair up with my Bose sound touch but I fix it by turning my wifi on and off
Brilliant range of music to suit all ages and tastes. Found albums and tracks I thought were lost forever. Couldn't be happier. Thank you
"Quick and easy to use. Probably the best music streaming app for 10 bucks, unless you get the family pack which makes it even cheaper."
I couldn't live without Spotify. I am a student and subscribed it with their awesome payment plan. The premium features are just way to good to use. The in-built cards with facts and lyrics on top of each song is what makes Spotify stand out and makes sure there is no Competition for their rivals. Spotify ‚ô•
"I've been a premium Spotify user for almost 2 years now and I love it! Spotify truly knows me. My personal mixes are rarely bad and thanks to Spotify, I've found quite a few is my new favourite artists and genres! DON'T HESITATE. Download this app. Get a premium subscription. Find new music. Simple."
I love my classical music and have been very pleasantly surprised by the choice of performances Spotify offers. Streaming quality is excellent and downloading for offline listening is quick and easy.
This app sometimes bugs out and I have to restart it but that may be more my phone than the app. I love the UI of this app and the music they offer. I use Spotify atleast 10 times a day.
"As a digital designer, you can feel the passion and effort going into this app. It is definitely created for the user experience. They are my favourite music app and they probably always will be if they keep existing."
Build playlists and download to your device for when you are offline. Great app with what seems to be unlimited music selection.
"Love my premium subscription, they have nearly every song I've looked for. However if you don't plan to get premium, the adds and restricted skips are quite annoying like any other app"
"I love Spotify. Premium is so much better, however. You can skip music, build playlist, listen to radio stations built on an artist and so much more. Huge music lover so Spotify is on all day at work."
Easily the best music service out there. Quality app with almost no bugs to speak of. The support for the app is also great as bugs are fixed very quickly. The UI is clean and simple to use. I have nothing but great things to say about this product.
Spotify has been an active participant in my life every day for the past two years. I can't imagine not listening to playlists or keeping up with my favorite artists without it. I genuinely enjoy using it and would recommend it to anyone.
"I've been a Spotify Premium for user for years now, and I'm incredibly satisfied with my user experience. Only rarely have I not been able to find a song, and the Spotify algorithm for finding songs I like is absolutely amazing. Well worth the monthly cost!"
"I spend at least 4 hours a day on Spotify. Well worth the ¬£10/month fee. Course, I wish it was cheaper, but hey - the offline mode is great. I just wish the 'built for you' piece, when playing music in your library, didn't use data. The song is in my library, there's no need for that."
Wasn't sure it was worth the subscription at first but you are quickly sold on the potential of Spotify. Most of the time the trickiest part is figuring out what you want to listen to.
Good selection of music and the app is fairly intuitive. Some minor navigation issues and the library is missing some artists (or earlier releases from existing artists) that one might reasonably expect to find. Good overall and better than others by far; my streaming service of choice.
Easily my favorite music app. The playlists specifically designed to users musical preferences are my favorite part. Fridays and Mondays are my favorite days of the week thanks to Spotify!
Love getting all my music from spotify! Easy to make your own playlists and quickly! Have a family plan which my whole house is able to use and it is a pretty great deal I think :)
"Best music app on the market (paid or free) if you're into finding, collecting and listening to your old found songs or discovering new ones. I love building my lifetime playlists. I hope there around forever."
Spotify Premium is genuinely the best investment I've ever made. On it 24/7. Wish they paid artists more. Has occasional glitches that can be super annoying but I love it!
"Only pay ¬£5 a month because I get a student discount and it is well worth the money. As long as my phone has the storage I can download as many albums and podcasts as I want, and there's a massive variety to choose from. It's easy to find new music that I like as well because the app actually suggests things suited to my tastes"
"Tbh this app is the best thing to use to listen to music besides mp3 juice. It's great to use, I found sum of my old music that i thought i would never find again but i found sum of them... u guys should get this app trust me you'll love it."
"Best music, talk, news & podcast app I've used! Lots of features, very intuitive and never invasive. Man... The future is finally here!"
"Works super great with the xbox, seemless, good quality audio via Bluetooth or headphone. I have found a lot of music because of it, I had such a bad view of Spotify before I used it, it's worth the money to have that music at the touch of a button on all my devices, just makes life easier."
"Best music app I've used. You can listen to podcast here, build playlist of your favourite music and share it. The auto playlist are great as well."
"EDIT: I got it fixed thanks to the help section :) Just uninstalled then reinstalled it. - - - I loved this app so much, and now my phone won't quit warning me that it is sucking up tons of battery, so it puts it to sleep and causes all kinds of problems with functionality. What happened?! :("
