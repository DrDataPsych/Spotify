Allan Lambert,"I'm only able to play 3 songs then it stops streaming all songs. When I press the play button nothing happens. To fix, I have to restart the phone, logg out then in, or reinstall the apps. When either of those things are done, it still only plays 3 songs then stops playing again. This needs to be fixed or I'll switch to another service. I have a Samsung galaxy s22 ultra.",1,1,2022-07-28 14:49:01,,
Toyosi Dosumu,"In the past I rated Spotify 5 stars. But for weeks now I have been having issues with the app. I'm using a premium account and when I click on a song it would show it's playing but it won't play any music, it loads I can see the icon picture and lyrics but its not playing the song. If it decides to play after 2 songs it stops again for hours, i would click play but it won't play out my songs. I have updated the app still the same thing.It makes me quite sad cause I love music. I hope they fix it",2,1,2022-07-28 14:22:07,,
Marie Berezhna,"Generally a good service, but! I'm a traveler and digital nomad so I change my location quite often and in order to continue using Spotify I have to change my country in the settings if my account. Can't we make it automatically? It's quite outdated to bind people to an adress. While I can understand that there might be payment/currency issues, but even on the free version it's happening as well.",4,0,2022-07-28 13:00:51,,
Nico Chan,App keeps on crashing no matter how many times I reinstall it. Apps that require a paid subscription and when you are unable to make use of it are really a bummer.,1,1,2022-07-28 12:59:02,,
M,The UI is atrocious. Clearly no one at spotify uses this or does any tests whatsoever. Where is everything? Literally every other Music app has a better UI. My Suggestion: Make it not atrocious. It also crashes randomly.,1,3,2022-07-28 12:24:51,"Hey, thanks for the feedback. If you have specific suggestions on how to improve it, feel free to add them to our ‘Ideas Board’ where others can show their support.

ghost,"I love to use it for music but after my ""30 minutes of ad free music"" ends I get an ad after every 2-3 songs unless I change my playlist. I can also play any song w/o shuffle on any other device rather than on my phone, which, imo, is quite stupid. It would be nice if they re-added that feature on phones w/o having to buy premium. All that aside, it's a good app to listen to music on if you have premium",3,0,2022-07-28 07:10:57,,

rough statue,"Not only do you not get to listen to any one particular song when you so wish to, it also has ads. The ads aren't a problem, because otherwise they wouldn't even offer free plans. The ads with the constant shuffle? Total garbage meant to ruin your day",2,0,2022-07-27 22:33:16,,
beatyz2,"Obvious stuff, they don't care about fixing long standing problems of their app on androids. I would appreciate if they could at least post the the version number of the last version that actually worked, so I wouldn't have to scour the internet to see what I can do to get a Spotify app that isn't half broken. But I guess that would also require admitting fault which I can only assume their attitude toward is ""why bother”",3,0,2022-07-27 22:32:01,,

Emornifi,Ads just ruin it. Especially the AD that says enjoy the next 30mins add free. That's literally an ad saying there's no ads. Geez who doesn't have something that blocks ads nowadays? Going back to my ad blocker site. Not snitchin. Annoying app for me I'm sorry.,1,0,2022-07-27 17:55:04,,

Un1verse,This app is so bad just busy to show huge amount of ads after a nano second even i cant play a single song because of lengthy ads. its a waste of time to use this application . youtube and other apps are better than this app. Thank you. Ads is not everything spotify has to give skip button or something like that from which we can skip ads. this app making me angry because its wasting my time. im uninstalling this app and installing again soundcloud thats it.,1,7,2022-07-27 17:27:59,,

Sean Michuki,I used to love this app alot and i had considered upgrading to premium.. But these days its always acting up.. You listen to two songs then it doesn't play the next.. I've tried everything from rebooting my phone to uninstalling and reinstalling but it isn't budging... To be honest its quite irritating and frustrating.. I give it 2 stars for the respect i have for the app.. Please look into the matter,2,2,2022-07-27 16:07:57,,
Sahil Mohammad,Please Fix the goddamn UI. It is getting frustrating to you use the app.,3,1,2022-07-27 15:39:22,,
brad atkins,Big shoes to fill lol. My suggestion would be to keep a functional non expiring app that is free sure throw in adds you deserve to make money too. I rarely have the luxury of purchasing anything above my immediate required needs like many but when I can and I've given this a lot of thought over the years I will go with what I trust like sure I want music without ads so I would stick with the app I already have and trust but I wouldn't stick with a free app if I have to redownload it every week.,3,0,2022-07-27 14:54:58,,
Kristjan Vendelin,Craftmanship from USSR and a comic book villain capitalist ruling over it. Everything is made hard. Shuffle button behind a pay wall but why would you pay if the music keeps stopping at random and only way to fix it would be restarting the phone? If they want to sell the shuffle button they should at least show it in free version (grayed out for example). Not let people search the internet IF there even is an option,1,0,2022-07-27 13:38:09,,
Gus Hayabusa,"Most bugs and requests I have reported to Spotify have been fixed and developed. This is how developers should react to feedback. One bug though remains: A downloading notification for Spotify playlists, remains (when playlist is automatically renewed) even if the download is over and the only way to get rid of it is to tap on it thus opening the app. Then it immediately goes away. Ps. How about a new UI theme choice? :!-)",4,24,2022-07-27 11:13:45,,
Arpit Mishra,"Spotify is a great service,but the app gets buggy sometimes. Managing podcasts can be a chore also, but overall it's pretty good. Miserable experience in the last week.

Pixelated,"There are other apps too stop pretending like you're the only one out there spotify. Even if that doesn't work I can just pirate music.

insanelysirius,"I love this app. I love how it chooses just the right song based on my activy, unlike with other apps that chooses a way different genre of a song I'm playing which sucks. But I hope there could be a button or a feature wherein we don't have to swipe up for the lyrics every single time, just something that would show the lyrics automatically for all songs we're playing. If you get the idea? I'll be looking forward for it.",4,28,2022-07-27 04:54:33,,
Jonh Mojica,"Free version is the worst. Try making a playlist and only listening to those songs. It's impossible. I don't want recommended music, I don't want similar music I only want to hear the music I selected to make a playlist. Give me All the ads you want but don't add music I didn't ask for and then penalize me for skipping them. This is the equivalent to bullying a person to pay for a service and I won't stand for it. If you choose to use the app don't do the free version cause you'll hate it",1,1,2022-07-27 04:35:22,,
Djdjff Dkjfjd,literally this was such a good music app but than after this dumb update it ruined everything now I can't even listen 2 the songs on my playlist to check them out real quick and than you always add songs to my playlist even when I add enough songs so you don't do that it's it's annoying I might just delete this app and find a different one to listen to music on.,3,0,2022-07-26 23:47:33,,
j,"I'm sick and tired of having unwanted suggested songs autoplay and shuffle in whenever I try to play a playlist, and being unable to skip them if I've used up the amount of skips given per hour. I can't even get rid of them from my queue without skipping even if I try to click off onto other playlists or close the app. Hiding the song does nothing to help either. PLEASE give us an option to remove suggested songs from our queue/let us edit what songs are coming up by having a music queue button!",1,1,2022-07-26 23:30:29,,

Hermit Sage,"I pay for premium but it will not let me save downloaded songs to an SD card. It just keeps moving them back. I go off grid a lot so this is very, very frustrating as I run out of space quickly. I'll change my rating to five stars when this is resolved as I have no other issues to note!",3,0,2022-07-26 21:32:54,,
Andrey Barsky,"The free version feels completely pointless, in it doesn't perform the most basic requirement of a music player - letting you pick songs you want to listen to, and listen to them. You can only give it a loose suggestion of what to play for you. And then you still get ads. I can't speak to the premium version, but the demo experience has done nothing to make me consider trying it. Just use youtube instead",1,5,2022-07-26 19:50:31,,
Richard Mankelow,"This is quite possibly the worst app I've ever installed (uninstalled now). You can't listen to what you want, only what they force you to listen to. Search is useless.

Creation Love Destruction Hatred,Stops playing music/podcasts after 30 or so mins. There's no 'now playing' bar at the bottom anymore so you can't skip songs/skip/rewind on podcasts. Earbud button functionality has gone. Spotify need to sort this out in the next week or so or I'm going to cancel my sub,1,0,2022-07-26 16:06:20,,

Maurice Ward,"Spotify has been playing very well for me. However, I am dealing with an annoying bug in which the music only plays for close to 10 seconds before quitting. I would clear my cache, re-install, and even made sure to fix my battery optimization. It would play, but then it would cut the song off at odd times. I can't really subscribe to a service that isn't working like it should. I don't know what happened, but this isn't the Spotify I remembered using.",2,36,2022-07-26 13:17:18,,
Krish Kalra,"Horrible fake promotions , I opt for the premium plan which was availble for 120 /- after availing Student discount but after making the payment, debit amount was 450 /- and I didn't recieved any info why they have charged 3 times of original price. Also even after upgrading to premium, app still has some bugs, earlier download button was not working but after sometime it was working.

Susie Ivan,"I wish I could give 0 stars. I love Spotify so much but have been having major issues for years. I almost never update because every time I do something goes wrong which makes it unusable. Realized I hadn't updated since 2020, so I updated and it took me off of my premium family plan even though NO info changed, I can't see my playlists OR the play button/bar, and I have to close the app to get the audio to stop.

Normal quality is GARBAGE, the higher quality is good and streams pretty well. They won't take my prepaid card, oh well I'm on tidal now why do these morons make it so difficult to pay them I've already given them over $500.

I also don't want you premium. I have more things to worry about than your premium. Another thing I would like to add is the shuffle button on the playbutton, I hate it.

It is definitely worth the money, everything about Spotify is amazing, and I've already managed to convert quite a few people. Keep up the incredible work.

The only thing I would say is to RELEASE HIGH FIDELITY!! EDIT: I have switched to Tidal until HiFi is released.",4,18,2022-06-04 22:23:28,,

Danijel Kurinčič,Today I wanted to create a party playlist on my Samsung tab s7 and Spotify failed miserably with at least a few major bugs and more design failures. There is a bug when the playhead isn't visible most of the time and it is almost impossible to scrub. There is a bug that my girl wasn't able to join the playlist. There is a bug that downloaded songs are not shown. Let alone that the whole UX is not adapted for a tablet and very miserable. Wth are you peeps doing up in Sweden?

Can't view an artist's songs and add the ones you want to a playlist without Spotify adding songs from other artists to the list you're choosing from after each selection you make.

Jon,"SPOTIFY IS TERRIBLE! Before podcasts, Spotify was fantastic. Today? utter disaster. The user interface (UI) is so bad that I am honestly in awe. If they go back 2-3 years, they will improve the quality of their app by a good margin. Sadly, they also support misinformation, they force content on premium users, and there is not even a way to edit the home page! I resorted to having my playlists as widgets, I simply open the app directly to a playlist, and never see more of the app. And the icing on the cake? remember the days when you could call Spotify and complain? well, those days are gone. They do not have a line to call. They are just terrible, for no good reason. Lastly, as someone with ADHD, who absolutly *needs* simplicity, this app is one of the worst there are (although most apps seem to travel the same way - down the drain).",1,1,2022-05-08 01:25:52,,

Aman Bhamboo,What a app always boasts about its premium version and it's kinda of forcing a customer to use their service.. they don't even care about their comfort but only focus on money making....I THINK IT IS USELESS TO DOWNLOAD BCZ THE REASON IS THEIR ADS 2 SONGS AND THEN AD AND AGAIN AD AND THE MOST FUNNY THING IS THAT U CAN'T EVEN SKIP THEM ........they just ruin your mood and vibe.....their premium service is very expensive...I am giving it 1 star Bcz I can't give it 0 stars......a useless app🤬🤬🤬,1,0,2022-05-04 05:38:20,,

Marc Hill,March 2022. Still no voice search in UK. I wouldn't mind not having the Spotify microphone button but for some reason Spotify have deemed it a good idea to actually remove the voice type (mic icon) from my Samsung keyboard where it normally resides. The microphone button there is greyed out and therefore I have no means of doing a voice search in the app. Even ones that are within the operating system. This makes no sense. This is very dangerous when trying to search for a tune when driving .,2,31,2022-05-03 21:00:22,,

Mirek Magierski,"I very rarely leave reviews and if I do, they're almost never negative but I feel compelled in this instance, as the Spotify app has got to be the worst app I have ever used. I'm on pay as you go with no Internet access unless I'm on Wi-Fi and all I use this app for is to listen to podcasts which I download in full before my work commute. It's obvious it simply has not been designed with any consideration for a user like myself. I would go as far as to state that it's terrible for podcasts in general, regardless of how you use your phone. To give you some examples: 1. When I'm at work, my phone will connect to the work Wi-Fi. There's an internal authorisation process to let devices use Internet when on the company network. What happens is that I can't play any podcasts if my phone's Wi-Fi is on - I press the play button, but nothing happens. I have two phones, one authorised to use the network and one not and this happens on both of them. I think what is taking place in the first instance is that our heavily filtered network will not let Spotify download ads and it completely throws it out of the loop. In the second instance, I think even though my phone is well aware it has no Internet access (despite being connected to Wi-Fi), Spotify ignores this fact and still tries to download ads before playing my podcasts. So every time I'm still within the huge range of my company's Wi-Fi, I need to disable my phone's Wi-Fi before I can play my podcasts for the commute home. After they start playing, I'm free to switch the Wi-Fi back on. But this isn't even the worst that this app does. 2. Quite frequently, right when I leave my company's Wi-Fi range (it always happens at almost the exact spot down to a few meters), the podcast that is being currently played will stop, losing its progress and the next one on the list will start playing. This is especially aggravating when I'm in the car and switching back to the podcast I was listening to and then finding the exact spot where I finished is impossible to do safely without stopping somewhere. But this still isn't the worst of it. 3. Recently the app started to randomly show all of my podcasts as not downloaded or actually deleting them (I'm still not sure what exactly happens as this only occurred 3 times so far, but all instances within the last month). The first time it happened, I've noticed as I walked out the door for work that my podcasts were gone. I had to redownload them all before leaving - I'm fortunate enough to be in a position where my bosses don't care what time I clock in but otherwise I'd probably by quite irritated. The next couple times it happened as I was trying to play my podcasts on my way home from work - but in those cases, when I got home, they annoyingly again started showing as downloaded and I could play them with no problems. Mind you, I have 40GB of free storage on my phone. And then there's the absolutely shockingly unusable and ugly interface (but I suppose it does fit the terrible Spotify logo). Manually removing a downloaded podcast from my playlist and downloads is an unintuitive multi-step process. I can't even change the order my podcasts will play in once they're on my playlist. I couldn't find a way to loop the playlist either, so if the last episode on your playlist is the first one you'll want to play, then you'll have to manually start the list from the top once it finishes. It can be supper annoying if this happens when you're on a motorway. It's like whoever created this app hasn't actually used it. It just blows my mind that a company as big as Spotify can't make an app that works, is usable and doesn't look like it was designed in Excel (actually, you can do much prettier things in Excel than that).",1,580,2022-04-02 16:19:07,,

Bürgus Capra,"My experience with Spotify has been generally horrible. I often listen to music on my Chromecast, but no matter what I do, Spotify will get stuck on connecting and never play whenever I tried to cast. This is a common, Spotify-side issue that's been plaguing the app for years and NEVER gets solved. When I manage to connect, sometimes Spotify will randomly disconnect and play on my phone.

Leigh Cheevers,As a whole this app is very good at being a music/podcast streaming app (i have the paid version). I don't have many of the issues that I see people commonly mention such as frequent crasking etc. However that being said there are 2 changes I would like to see that would improve the experience to a better level. 1) the quick scroll bar om the right side of the screen needs to be brought back to aid scrolling through long playlist. 2) volume needs to be increased through the app,4,29,2022-03-12 08:52:10,,

Otherwise, they'd design the app so that you get charged when you use it. Back when I was a teen, it wouldn't have mattered to me bc I pretty well lived on music.

Just adding 5 songs to a playlist or queue could genuinely take you 10 minutes.

Suyash,"I LOVE THIS APP, (I have Spotify premium) and it has made my experience 10 times better, just listening to my favourite songs in high res without any interruptions feels like heaven and not to mention this app definitely has 95% of songs on the planet so that's cool, I love Spotify wrapped aswell, makes me feel special Lol. the ui is top notch!

Often it doesn't work at all, can't find my downloads, and I waste minutes fiddling around with the app trying to make it work. Needs a serious rethink.",2,62,2022-01-17 11:23:31,,

Aiyana Hammon,The app is great except the fact that if you don't pay for premium they ruin your listening experience. They play the same songs over and over and over again and they interup you with adds every 5 seconds.

Khazamula Manganye,Tried the app again after a long time off it and what a change. The lyrics functionality is now present and the app is no longer buggy and slow. I still don't understand why we have to deal with podcasts though. New artist recommendation deserves a bigger spotlight (front and centre). Tour dates and merch is harder to find now. How about artist interviews and SM built in. Listening parties is still a mission. At this point it's just okay and barely competes with the other services. Music first.,3,77,2022-01-16 09:07:10,,

Jonathan Lilley,"Hurrah! They've changed the 'Play' button back to normal after the experiment with making 'shuffle' its default action, with no option to change it, in spite of the many genres and the spoken word content that need to be heard in order, and in spite of the thought & care that go into album programming. Spotify is once again a very decent music app, attached to one of the best music libraries around, making the sub terrific value. I like the facility to 'cast' music to Chromecast, which I expect I will love once the software allows Chromecast to respect the Autoplay setting on the controlling app.",4,9,2021-12-07 04:35:00,,

Oliver Campbell,Definitely my most used app. I love how you can add your own artwork to playlists and put them in folders. Love Spotify 🖤.

Nigel Greenway,It's a well laid out UI and the ability to stream to Alexa speakers/groups is a welcomed feature. Recently I had an issue with Android Auto where Spotify wouldn't work at all. Over a period of time Spotify support were helpful throughout and went through the diagnosis with me and we're both patient and pleasant. (Issue got resolved when my OS version updated). The playlist features - like sharing sessions - are really good and I can discover music really easily. I love the artist info too!,5,54,2021-10-19 08:29:41,,

Sarah C,Library and especially playlists ruined. Hideous disorganization. It throws all my albums and playlists together as default and the alphabetical function doesn't apply to playlists within folders. I have a folder with 126 lists that NEEDS alphabetical order otherwise it's disorganized & can't be navigated. I've spent years systematically cultivating those playlist covers to fit this order. My years of work is obliterated. Why take away a perfectly good library format and make it LESS navigable?,1,0,2021-10-18 17:21:19,,

They provided me with a free month when I requested it and everyone was really friendly. New UI is not my preference. 2 stars usability.,4,88,2021-09-05 04:25:48,,

Isaac,Why on earth would you design your app to require an internet connection before I can access the podcasts that I've downloaded for offline playback the night before?!

I have to open notification bar to skip song, or seek current playlist position where I'm now, or open song view !! This is inconvenient. 2) recommendations are ""repeating"" by nature. I meet alot of songs that already in my Liked 3) Random order and repeat setting - always messed up, not saved what i set it last 4) I'm really surprised that such simple things are not fixed in #1 music app. I've used other app before, and it was working good",3,33,2021-09-03 15:19:17,,

Turning off the autoplay button didn't work. The only reason I'm giving Spotify 5 stars and not 4 is because I find it soooo awesome that the podcasts episodes come with transcripts.

arghnothingworks,"App has been broken since the nu-spotify GUI/update. You used to be able to like songs in playlists like your daily mix etc while offline. This was a great tool if you could fight their algorithm however since the app now hangs or crashes whenever attempting to like, or bring up the popup menu while offline the experience is beyond poor. They are aware of this bug for months but have yet to make any progress. This bug is so large that it impacts even disabling shuffle while playing from a daily mix because they moved that function to the popup menu too. It has broken every single mix or radio or playlist you have offline and the effort of remembering and setting aside time to add things later just is not worth it. This is a paid service at a hefty premium in 1st world countries so you would expect some degree of bug fixes but spotify have just left users in the dust.",1,20,2021-08-02 03:53:07,,

Drishtant Rai,Recently with last two updates spotify is broken and is crashing a lot on android 12. It freezes whole system for about a minute or so everytime I start playing music. Sometimes song is added to player but it never plays on a strong network connection too and even when its downloaded for offline listening. Very trash experience after some latest updates. I know you guys will blame android 12 beta builds for this but no other platform is causing this issue on android 12. Also sound quality is trash compared to jiosaavan and youtube music. Spotify sound is simply not loud enough. I have turned volume mode to loud and sound quality is very high. But it simply doesn't cut it for me. I am loosing a lot of details in songs simply because of quality is not good enough. Also all the complaints that I had I wrote it here so dont ask me to write a mail to spotify support because I did and you never took action on it. Your team didn't even read that email. I will look for another month and if situation doesn't improve I will have to unsubscribe. Terrible Experience.,1,85,2021-07-23 13:49:34,,

Even with a premium account it would randomly decide to restart or end a 4 hour podcast or just refused to play anything.

Rob C,"Great service. The new UI looks nice but needs work. When looking at the discography the filters need to be sticky at the top of the screen so they can be reselected easily, or even better, the app needs to remember the last filter selection used. Currently when you back out of an album the view goes back to unfiltered and you have to return to the top and reset the filters to continue.

But in favor of what? It doesn't look nicer or neater, only cruder. That plenty of space could be used for a like button or seeing other songs in a playlist, which would be minor but really convenient impovements, or other bells and whistles. Spotify seems to be the best streaming service the market has to offer, yet it has to keep up with Yandex Music that provides the possibility to listen to podcasts (which has been promised to be done since Spotify's release here in Russia) and read the lyrics (so far there's only Genius Behind The Lyrics in Spotify, which is something at least but definitely not the thing).

samar pratap,Everything is good . But improvement is needed in some areas like showing recent played songs and search... I think it's easy to show all the recent songs alone rather than showing it like an album and moreover sometimes you miss the songs too. Simply show the last played songs but no you want us to search that again and what if I forget the song name... You have good collection of songs I must say that's why I have to give 3 star.

Just search for users who simply want to a play an album in the order it is in, and you will find hundreds if not thousands of complaints going back years. One huge button that says, ""Shuffle Play"" and no intuitive way to play it in order. What's worse is even if you do know to click the first song in the list, it still does not work if you still songs queued as it reverts to shuffle after the first song. As an IT professional of 35 years' experience, including UI design, this is simply unacceptable. Many answers give workarounds such as ""go to Desktop app"" ... guess what, not everyone has a Desktop app, and giving users ""workarounds"" for a years old issue is NOT a solution.",1,17,2021-06-16 15:57:31,,

The listener/watcher should be able to pick if Spotify should add random songs to the playlist, say a kid has it and creates a Playlist with baby shark then it could get ruined w/ a song w/ curse words.

Mikkels kanal Pilgaard,Spotify is a great platform for music or podcasts Even without premium. Although you still get ads they aren't usualy that long (like 10-30 seconds Max) and then you can listen to a few songs before you get another one. Premium offers the same but more without the ads which is quite Nice. I would deffenetly recomend since premium isnt too expensive (like 15$ a month),5,7,2021-06-07 14:58:17,,

Under the songs category, media from my local drive are shown first and then those from the web. This works for me since my music is a hybrid of local songs and songs from the web. I can directly go ahead and add the local media to a playlist directly from the search results. Now that doesn't happen anymore. Only media from the web are shown in search results.

Firstly, the offline mode doesn't launch unless you first have a wifi conenction, which is annoying. The app also crashes a lot, or straight up doesn't play music/respond to buttons to skip or pause songs. I have this problem not only on mobile but all platforms.

The new podcast menu is terrible and takes more Clicks to get through to new episodes. The play button that comes up when you open the app disappears for several seconds for reasons I'll never understand before it reappears and becomes usable. Very frustrating, especially when I'm paying for it",1,7,2021-05-12 22:16:11,,

Raven,"Most recent update sucks. I genuinely don't understand why apps keep making updates that don't actually improve anything, just make the interface different and more difficult to use while you adjust to it.

fazlehadi azmat7g,I like this app very much. But there should be a option for replay music. As if you play it in background and do something else in your phone and when the song finishes you need to replay it but there isn't a button for that. You have to open the app and replay. I love this app. Please add this feature. I love it great app. Thanks,4,0,2021-05-12 16:59:02,,

Pedro Geaquinto,"Great service but only on Windows. On Android the playback pauses when other apps play any audio, which is at most annoying. The problem with this is that the app shuts down almost immediately after the music stops. It's not a problem from battery saving or whatever excuse developers are giving, it is a built-in bug that they are ignoring because they'll rather push features that no one asked for such as artists not related to the user's taste. Fix this because it is a PAID service after all!",2,24,2021-05-12 00:24:32,,

Kyla Tawa,Overal love Spotify but I don't love the recent update to the library. The filtering system means I have to click many buttons to get to my downloaded podcast episodes. They're not the same as New Episodes. And when I do filter down to downloaded podcasts I still have to click into the podcast to find the episode. Music and podcasts are very separate for me and this mixes them all together and it's hard to find what I want. Hopefully this feedback helps in upcoming developments.,4,14,2021-05-11 12:16:06,,

Also it keeps crashing on my more than average phone It also feels like they just want money because I used to have free and the ads made fun of you...,1,4,2021-05-06 08:10:23,,

Sometimes we have a bad week and I don't approve the choice made for me, but I know we will get along. And we do, always. Just a few words to contribute to those who cannot afford Premium.

Aabhas Saini,"Degrading free user experience just to make a cheap buck is not a good idea in my eyes. If you show 3 ads (In my case) after each song, then the listener will rather get frustrated and will leave Spotify and go to soundcloud instead of buying premium. They do not charge a buck and still give a nice adless experience. Even musixmatch is better than this. Why, then, do YOU charge money to get rid of ads? Make ad frequency as low as 1-2 ads per 5 songs and I think you might still make money.",1,0,2021-03-11 13:39:35,,

I hate trying to listen to Playlists because of shuffle and the fact it doesn't allow you to skip more than 6 times an hour and the shuffle playes songs that aren't even on my playlists so I can't do anything. Sellouts. 2 stars because the music but not the app. They ruined Spotify and its so dumb. Either get rid of shuffle and let us listen to OUR music or don't make an app.,2,2,2021-03-10 22:19:15,,

I would give Spotify zero stars for not having Accent - Fluierături in biserică, but I am minding my suffering... somehow. Music should surprise you, not serve you like chocolate after being dumped by a lover. Also music is math only the soul can solve, but it is math. It is therefore holy",5,6,2020-12-27 16:48:42,,
Redips Knuj,"I got lured with 3 months for the price of 1 and yet again, I know, this won't be extended subscription. Basically mobile app hangs and crashes way too often. Unless you want to play the pre-made playlist as is, song based radio or random list without skipping, it works, but skipping tracks, and I mean skipping 2-5 songs often causes app to simple hang and fail playing any music. Another thing is how podcasts are shoved into your feed. I don't like them, I don't listen them, and have no idea if I can even hide them because UI of the app is atrocious. Since it's creation, spotify navigation is as pleasant as wiping with charred stick would be. Not so great. Terrible to be honest. Last thing, I was would be working, was algorhythm, which used to be really cool, giving interesting tunes and bands to check but even that got wrecked somehow. If by chance, I wanted to listen to one particular song once, it will be coming back and forth each week but if I listen to certain songs on and on, I won't get any suggested playlists which actually could be linked to those tracks. How come? Algorhythm used to be really well made. Shame.",2,12,2020-12-27 06:24:53,,

Toxic Kpop,I give Spotify 4 stars only because it gives you quite a lot of ads but not some much that you get really angry. Also if you want to listen to one song in general you have to get premium then you can do that or you have to make a whole playlist with different songs too. You can also think of this as a positive or a negitive as Spotify tends to switch you onto a totally different playlist. I like this as I can find different songs that I never knew of. But overall Spotify is a great app.,4,14,2020-12-26 16:35:58,,
sir_abraham_301,It never really gives you a WHOLE 30 minutes without ads. And some times its like it knows when am trying to go sleep becuase it will give me like THREE ads every TWO songs.

This was notified in the previous version of windows application but was never available for android apps. Same track from same album, multiple copies of that in same playlist should be a complete NO-NO. 2. There is no option to find what podcasts you follow in mobile app. You should be able to see the podcast button on the same activity where it shows, artists, albums and songs.

Lavakia Falwasser-williams,Spotify Is a really good App that gets you going when you hear the music. I have had Spotify for awhile now and I really enjoy It. All the playlist you can make and Its so good because you can also listen to music while offline. 👍😁 I would recommend this App to any age. One thing that is quiet annoying is that well yes ADDS super annoying ads. But you can just listen to playlist and then not be distracted by them. I listen to Spotify whenever I'm at school or when I have spare time. Recommend,4,0,2020-10-06 23:40:20,,

A Google user,"So, I used to love Spotify alot. And one of the most common things that I would do is search up a singular song and play it, but now I am unable to do so.

Bernard Butler,"Thr shuffle feature is rather a basic algorithm. Despite having 9 albums in one playlist, you will find time after time the same few songs get automatically chosen. So if you try sorting your playlist into the available headings ie album,newly added artist etc you willl have shuffled your own playlist. Otherwise the songs you played the most get chosen by your spotify shuffle button.",4,0,2020-08-19 17:47:45,,

There is a similar, but not one click. 4. There is no number of times played for each track (Google Play Music have this feature). 5. No lyrics in text form (like in the unofficial Google Play Music player, but it's in beta mode right now). Lyrics in text form is really useful for non native language speakers.

Frederik Seidelin,"No-one would accept functionality this poor from any app they paid for unless it was as ubiquitous as Spotify. Sure, music plays fine on the phone - but as soon as you want anything 'special', such as connecting to other devices (which is a selling point of Spotify and Spotify-branded devices) or making a queue (which WinAmp did better in 1999!!), Spotify struggles like the appalling POS that it is.

hrishi barne,It's good that you're now giving lyrics with the songs but it needs to be more subtle. You know it's just too bold and seems like an ameture developed that feature out of boredom. Kind of ruining the overall player screen. You could provide lyrics like one line at a time and fading it away when sung. And please don't provide directly on the main screen just have it one click away and also if possible a Full screen album poster while playing. Thank you.,4,5,2020-07-19 18:44:25,,

Whenever I switch to a new Bluetooth device I'm require to force stop the app otherwise I have no audio even though I've disconnected from the other Bluetooth device.,2,1,2020-07-10 19:15:03,,
Vince Andrei Ong,"The thing with Spotify is that... It may be a business but it ain't kind to the people who can't afford the Premium for the app. Points I'd like to point out : It doesn't let you pick and choose the artist that YOU ONLY WANT TO HEAR FROM, but instead try show to artists that you have little interest in. It keeps reminding you that you should buy the Premuim for Spotify... You kidding me? I am already sitting through multiple ads before I even get to hear the song. And many more.",3,1,2020-07-10 18:32:46,,
Tamaru A,"Great until it wasn't recently for some reason it stops playing midway through some of my songs. And when I press play, it starts the song all over again. Thought it was my headphones going bad but it happens when they're not connected and my connection is perfectly fine. Please look into this issue before your next update because I love this app for my music and would hate to have to move back to my built in music player on my phone. Update: still have to restart my songs due to random stops",2,14,2020-07-10 18:22:07,,
sumit singh,"Recommendations are great. Here I'll go for Pros - Cons: Pros: 1. Recommendations are great 2. UI is also nice and ligh weight 3. Can download music in premium membership. 4. And it syncs with all the signed in device, so u can controll the playback from any device by using the same app. 5. It has really good collection of English albums and solo. Cons: 1. There is no option to download only one song from an Album 2. Smart download is not there (for repeated songs)",4,4,2020-07-10 11:28:11,,
kirglow,"Spotify is an amazing service, but the app has a terrible UI. Everything is a struggle: I can't even look at new episodes of all my followed podcasts. I can't search podcasts by a certain name and order them by date. It takes a long time to navigate from listening to music to scrolling to find a podcast I want to listen to in my library, then scrolling to the right episode that I haven't listened to, etc. The UI is not intuitive and takes A LOT of time to navigate. I would much prefer the way youtube has done it with subscriptions, new videos and their searching. That said, Spotify has amazing features for discovering new music, such as Song radio, that is essential for finding novel music that you're likely to like. I think out of all other services I use, Spotify would be the hardest to give up, but they need a serious app re-design since everything even slightly complex is impossible to do, and everything simple - takes a long time.",3,3,2020-07-10 11:12:06,,

Suraj Kumar,"I started with a Love & Hate relationship with Spotify but a sheer lack of product improvement and innovation has made it more of a Hate & less of a Love for it. Apart from other things, Spotify misses out on two very basic but critical features really badly, 1. I pay for Spotify Premium so that I can download the songs for offline listening but unless and until I specifically put the App in OFFLINE mode, it still continues to gobble my mobile data and never cares to check whether the song to be played is already there in Downloads or not! The experience is even bad in areas with choppy network coverage and while travelling. 2. I have a playlist of 1500 songs but the SHUFFLE feature always ends up playing any 30-35 songs in a loop and thats about it! The SHUFFLE feature is completely broken!

You can't skip more than 6 songs in your playlist unless you pay for premium, nor can you remove the songs spotify adds into your playlists without premium. Yes, they actually add songs into your playlists without your consent. The UI overall is very confusing on the phone version and it's a pain in the ass to control.Things got really money hungry on the phone version and I will not be using it.",1,0,2020-05-06 01:39:59,"Hey there, thanks for reaching out!

A Google user,Been using for a few years now. User experience is excellent save for a few quirks - for example finding all songs by an artist via an artist page is difficult. Instead you have to simply search the artist and not select their page. The adaption of suggestions to your tastes and listening habits is impressive (and maybe slightly worrying!). The range and quality of music is incredible. Connectivity options are also great.,5,27,2020-04-03 12:59:56,,

The graph is just going down by the day.,1,5,2020-03-20 05:28:53,,
A Google user,Update drops all our downloads and messed up my Podcasts so I could not see what I had already had watched 😡 we also seem to be having to turn on mobile data to get already downloaded media to play.

In fact it even cut out as I wrote that. I've disabled all battery saving options, sleep options, the playlist is downloaded, yet for the first five minutes after leaving my house, Spotify will just stop, it says it's playing, then it might restart, but often it takes me to either open my phone, open solidity and start/ stop it, even shut down Spotify and restart Spotify (then it will just freeze up, requiring another closing of the app).",1,24,2020-03-18 10:53:31,,

Managing downloaded songs is painstakingly complicated - some removed downloaded songs are still in the liked songs, and user need to 'like' a song to download, and good luck bulk with removing songs.

A Google user,"The service is fantastic, execution nonsensical. A few days ago (date posted 26.6.19), Spotify's layout changed and damaged user experience. The problems are: 1. What happened to Recently Played? It was removed entirely, and music is in three tabs now: Playlists, Artists, and Albums. 2. The sorting in these tabs is absurd. Playlists places last listened to on top. Artists is only alphabetical for followed artists, regardless of download status. Album works fine. 3. Load times increased.",2,1,2019-06-26 22:14:41,,

A Google user,The Spotify app shouldn't require the internet to browse artists. It should allow users to browse downloaded music by artist. The only way to retrieve music by artist when not connected to the internet is by search using the artist's name. But search doesn't group the somgs by album. To search you have to explicitly put the app in offline mode. The app should automatically go into offline mode when not connected to the internet.,1,6,2019-04-19 13:13:18,,

Why on earth would the developers overlook this, especially after a user becomes a paid subscriber.  One would think they'd get more features but in this case we get less features.  Bizarre.

Hi, I'm zach and I've had spotify premium since I was a sophomore in high school. That was almost five years ago. Over time I have built up a 'epic collection' according to spotify but according to them I've filled my library and cant save anymore songs. The cap is 10,000 songs. I still listen to almost all of it, as hard as that is to believe but because of this limit it makes it hard to believe spotify is good source to listen to music if I cant even save all of my music. Please up the cap for everyone, it's a bad idea if I cant keep my music in one place and I'm paying monthly. If the cap was increased this app has the potential I thought it would. To last me forever but obviously it's not the case. Think twice and read carefully before you buy premium if you think this is the next itunes. I apologize to spotify as i love the service but this is a down side I cant look past and for anyone who would use your service for an extended amount of time, as I have, shouldnt loom past either. Please increase my library maximum capacity because even if only ""1% of members are reaching the limit"" eventually everyone will and its gonna be something you will have to confront anyway or lose people like me who came to the service because we love the service.",2,0,2018-11-08 23:29:14,,

A Google user,"This app, to me, used to be 5/5 and has and still is my only go to music platform. However, there is the issue of crashes left and right, and the ""fake start"" where it will show you loading the home screen until you restart the app. The latter has been a non issue woth my s9+, for some reson I can circumvent the problem by tapping another tab. Not the case for my old s5 or my much newer s8+, as well as a friends A5. This is something I concider quality of life issue, but the constant rearrangement of the UI is killing me, either hire someone that actually know how to rearrange it in a ergonomical(?) way or don't do it at all, it's getting old. And im not talking about your UI cause thats factory fresh every 6 months.(yes i know this is a trend for trendy apps, i.e. Chrome, messenger, facebook, and on) The only thing I can wholeheartedly praise them for is their costumer service in my experience, nice, polite, friendly and quick to pick up on a more casual tone of converse, which saves everyone alot of time, text chat wise.

And AFAIK Spotify has discontinued support for third party clients which is ludicrous considering their POS client. If someone reading this has no problem with Spotify's UI. Imagine if you could sort your music by year released, add your own genre tags and bring up all your music tagged ""rock"" and ""rap"" and shuffle that. Imagine you could change the appearance of your client, so that obnoxious vomit green isn't all over your screen. This, coupled with the fact that as I've added playlists and albums to my library my client has slowed considerably, such that opening the app on any platform takes a minute before I can do anything, minus Linux which ""only"" takes 30 seconds. In conclusion, Spotify revitalise your support for the creation of third party apps, and after a working Foobar plugin gets created I'll change this review to a 5.

Also or me I have a good few similar style playlists, I'd love to be able to have control to add certain playlists together. Last thing promise which might sound a bit mad is curating your saved music by tempo - so for example its 5pm on a Saturday and youre preping food followed by friends arriving, then after food drinks begin to flow it's now 11pm and getting ready to hit the road to a bar etc. The tempo for me starts slow then gradually picks up - a lot of us will manually change playlists from chill to medium to upbeat. It would be so cool if I could pick a wave length and set a time frame for how that wave length/tempo change pans out.

A Google user,"Look, Spotify is undoubtedly the best music streaming service... for consumers. It's a great service. Here's the thing though: Spotify may be the best and biggest, but it doesn't pay even close to the highest amount of revenue to artists per stream. The amount artists make from Spotify is a miserable tuppence compared to other streaming services that are inferior in every other way. Napster, which is an unintuitive, messy app with a far, far smaller user-base pays a uniform ~1.7 cents per stream -- about 300% what Spotify pays to artists. Spotify, I love you, but there is no reason why you shouldn't be better to artists than this. The artists deserve better from you. And when you decide to get your act together I'll be back, but in the meantime I'll be buying music straight from the artists and streaming on Napster.

A Google user,"New update for android is terrible! Please fix! I have spotify premium but i wont continue to pay for an app that keeps randomly shutting down, keeps playing when bluetooth is turned off or auxiliary cord is removed. My phone isn't recognising spotify as a media player at all, and i can see from other reviews that im not the only one! Fix it!!!",1,0,2018-09-20 04:21:59,,

A Google user,"App really lets the service down. Used to be absolutely perfect but as of recent the app has gone absolutely downhill. I have bought premium because i listen to music while not connected to the internet, and sometimes the ongoing notification doesnt come up, sometimes the next button doesnt work, sometimes the shuffle play doesnt work, definately not worth the $12 im paying every month at the moment.",3,0,2018-09-19 23:25:57,,
A Google user,"Spotify you have massively screwed something up on the latest updates, weird behaviour all over the place. Pausing itself, unpausing itself while in different apps, lock screen bar always incorrect, play button in pull down menu doesn't work!!! Geez great app love it but this has got to the point of considering another service after a few weeks of this! OMFG it was completely closed and has reopened itself and started playing even as I type this! DON NOT PAY FOR PREMIUM WHILE THIS APP IS PLAYING UP LIKE THIS!!!",1,0,2018-09-19 23:06:54,,
A Google user,"Music control not showing in notification center, bad Chromecast connection and the ability to make a queue. Also, shuffle play button not working, stopping playing after 3 songs.",1,0,2018-09-19 23:01:21,,
A Google user,"Very often it looses the connection to internet and says ""Sorry, something went wrong"" though connection is perfectly fine. UI needs work as well, finding things takes longer than expected, some albums are not even there and discover weekly gives me songs that I trully hate.. Sometimes you get ads on premium (drakes latest album) and support is not very helpful either, the only good thing is that Spotify has albums listed as soon as they are released.",1,1,2018-09-19 15:06:24,,
A Google user,Garbage app. Terrible UX if you like listening to albums. Three stars until recent updates when it had been exceptionally buggy. Randomly stops playing.,1,0,2018-09-19 05:44:03,,
A Google user,This app is my absolute favourite for music and I have happily paid for it for quite some time but the recent glitches like telling me I'm offline when I absolutely am not are killing it. I've had to re download the app every 2 days just to be able to search for music. Please please fix this.,3,0,2018-09-19 05:31:12,,
A Google user,These guys spend way to much time screwing up their app while they're saying they are making it better. That is not the case. Seems they removed the ability to thumb up and thumb down any song. I'm also having a very difficult time finding the cancel button for my subscription.,1,2,2018-09-19 00:07:32,,
A Google user,"Since the last update it crashes, when skipping songs on my lock screen it doesn't update the information but changes the song. Sometimes in the app when hitting skip it doesn't update the ui but does skip.... I wish I could uninstall the last update. My friend also has a Samsung s9 and has the exact same issues.",2,0,2018-09-18 22:45:15,,
A Google user,"App is getting crappier as time goes on. Won't load songs, slow to load on a good connection. Also randomly stops playing music quite often.",1,0,2018-09-18 17:48:10,,
A Google user,"Current issues with the app are: no notification, can't change music without entering app, can't skip more than three songs without it jamming, constantly thinks it's offline so cannot search or play non-downloaded music, doesn't recognise when Bluetooth is disconnected, can't pause/play from Bluetooth, cuts itself off every 20 minutes. There are complaints on their forum about this from over three months ago so it's really bizarre they haven't either patched it or rolled back to a previous version that does work while they rebuild an obviously disastrous update. When it worked it was the best music app - but not by much, and any one of the issues above should be enough for most people to use GPM or Amazon Music or Apple Music or YouTube Music or any of the other plethora of options.",1,3,2018-09-18 16:37:34,,
A Google user,"Just calling Spotify out on quietly removing ""extreme"" quality on streaming, and then after a while on downloads as well, while keeping the service the same price. Come on guys.",3,0,2018-09-18 06:43:25,,
A Google user,"Piece of absolute garbage!!!!!Wouldn't let me search online ever again after one random day. I have premium and it keeps saying I'm offline. The ""offline mode"" button is off. I tried reinstalling, I tried logging out Then in. I tried turning my phone off I tried different Wi-Fi I tried everything. It still says I'm offline which is ridiculous. Now I can't play any songs I don't have downloaded. Ridiculous. Uninstalling. Cancelling sub. Getting Pandora. I'm sick of this useless app.",1,0,2018-09-18 06:35:44,,
A Google user,"The app was good in general. One thing really bug me though is the widget does not work. Sometimes it's just blank, and all other times it does nothing when I push the 'play' button. I'm on Android Oreo.",3,0,2018-09-18 02:13:09,,

A Google user,"All my Downloaded music has disappeared several times; there is no support readily available; the faq gives 4 or 5 possible solutions, which either don't apply or require tons of work; a company this size should have a helpline , particularly if so many people complain about the same major issue!!!!",2,0,2018-09-17 06:26:13,,
A Google user,"I just wish the payment and family sharing methods were less confusing. My family couldn't get it to work, and when I wanted to upgrade to premium for myself after unsubscribing previously, there was no button for a single account. That is to say that I had only the option to pay the family price.",4,0,2018-09-17 04:58:12,,
A Google user,"I love the app, but there's one feature that HAS TO BE IMPROVED.. PLEASE! There's a playlist called ""Discover Weekly"", from what I understand it's supposed to be built every week with music related to the songs I usually listen to..  Well.. I love rock music.. alternative/punk rock etc.. but I hate ""Growling"" (that part when the vocalist is screaming and destroying his own vocal chords) for some reason that ""discover weekly"" algorithm can't seem to track the fact I am skipping any song with growlings the second they appear.. I find lots of cool songs that I like in that playlist, but 50% of them contains that thing that I hate, which is a huge bummer for me..  Can you please fix this?",2,0,2018-09-16 15:35:29,,
A Google user,The mobile app just fails to deliver an intuitive user interface. Sometimes music is playing in the background and suddenly the app dies. Sometimes it just doesn't stop playing music when watching a video on other app.,2,0,2018-09-16 03:33:50,,
A Google user,"Sorry for the bad review, I love the concept of Spotify but the app itself is poor. It keeps bugging especially with searching for music: constantly telling me that ""Something went wrong"" and that it cant connect to the internet but I can listen to Songs I havent saved. The Issue has been common in every version but in the newest one (15.09) i cant search for new songs at all. Also it keeps stoping the musik for no reason (no buttons were pressed)",2,0,2018-09-15 20:07:25,,
A Google user,Not a fan of the UI. Song playing does not match what's showing. Also noticed that recent reviews are not very good and that Spotify does not respond to their subscribers in the review section.,1,0,2018-09-15 04:48:54,,
A Google user,"EDIT: I got it fixed thanks to the help section :) Just uninstalled then reinstalled it. - - - I loved this app so much, and now my phone won't quit warning me that it is sucking up tons of battery, so it puts it to sleep and causes all kinds of problems with functionality. What happened?! :(",5,0,2018-09-14 16:25:12,,
A Google user,"The new interface is awful!!! Cant use landscape mode while playing a song, the repeat button is now hidden and I'm unsubscribing premium because of this garbage",2,1,2018-09-14 01:44:41,,
A Google user,I've been using Spotify for almost 4 years. If you're looking for what you want when you want this is the app. You can build playlist or search through other playlists 💯 x better than Pandora,5,0,2018-09-12 09:36:43,,
