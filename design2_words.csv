review_description
"In the past I rated Spotify 5 stars. But for weeks now I have been having issues with the app. I'm using a premium account and when I click on a song it would show it's playing but it won't play any music, it loads I can see the icon picture and lyrics but its not playing the song. If it decides to play after 2 songs it stops again for hours, i would click play but it won't play out my songs. I have updated the app still the same thing.It makes me quite sad cause I love music. I hope they fix it"
"Not only do you not get to listen to any one particular song when you so wish to, it also has ads. The ads aren't a problem, because otherwise they wouldn't even offer free plans. The ads with the constant shuffle? Total garbage meant to ruin your day"
I used to love this app alot and i had considered upgrading to premium.. But these days its always acting up.. You listen to two songs then it doesn't play the next.. I've tried everything from rebooting my phone to uninstalling and reinstalling but it isn't budging... To be honest its quite irritating and frustrating.. I give it 2 stars for the respect i have for the app.. Please look into the matter
Latest update causes music player bar to sporadically disappear throughout the day (both in-app and out). Can't start music sometimes as well. Not to mention the UX changes made over the past couple of years making navigating my own saved music a hassle.
"Spotify has been playing very well for me. However, I am dealing with an annoying bug in which the music only plays for close to 10 seconds before quitting. I would clear my cache, re-install, and even made sure to fix my battery optimization. It would play, but then it would cut the song off at odd times. I can't really subscribe to a service that isn't working like it should. I don't know what happened, but this isn't the Spotify I remembered using."
"It plays music, but the ads are insane, you can only listen to playlists on shuffle, and the button to repeat a song is gone, so you can only play a song once. You can't listen to a song by itself, just the preview. I miss the old Spotify."
"Everything is good except audio quality, Songs selection, recommendation, UI, I love it but in terms of audio quality even when i suscribe - its way too low then others. They dont even allow to talk tk customer care services."
Buggy with a terrible ui.
Same song over and over and your app just cuts off whenever it wants. I mean same song I've had to literally hit the hide button on songs I like just to stop hearing them. We are so intelligent yet none of our technology works correctly and we are all just ok with it I don't understand. Hold yourself to higher standards please everyone's ok with the basic half assed work and I'm so confused
"Keeps removing songs from my playlists, STOP DOING THAT MAN. Random order isn't actually random it's set and never changes. Normal quality is GARBAGE, the higher quality is good and streams pretty well. They won't take my prepaid card, oh well I'm on tidal now why do these morons make it so difficult to pay them I've already given them over $500. The only advantage of Spotify over others is that is streams with less cut out on higher quality. Normal quality here should be illegal and a lawsuit."
The play bar has been disappearing for the past year or so and this still hasnt been fixed which then requires me to force stop the app multiple times a day. It's exhausting. I pay for premium.
"Was working great until recently. However, has stopped working in a major way. When I'm not connected to the internet or even when I am playing music, the buttons disappear and so does any access to the app but it keeps playing or stops randomly and I can't get it to play again. Been recommended to switch apps, but will wait and see if there is an update patch... Have reinstalled already..."
Hacked multiple times... no 2 factor authentication... the helpdesk is quick to respond but still a hassle.
Since the latest update songs won't play or will just skip the song quite annoying and I pay for the subscription need to sort it out ASAP
"The software has really been sucking lately. Lots of visual glitches in the app requiring restart, and just general fuvky-wuckyness 🤷"
"I was a premium user for 6 months . I canceled and went to Deezer when it started giving me constant problems with storing music and having to redownload them constantly . The app is also a bit glitchy . It does have the most polished GUI , beautiful to look at . They were just getting a bit to invasive for my taste and not working as intended . Not acceptable in a paid app ."
Everything requires premium. I hate it. The songs are good atleast.
"You ""like"" songs & make playlists. That's really about it. Extremely LACKLUSTER software design. I mean seriously, a team of professionals designed this software? * No way to organize playlists on mobile. * Got rid of EQ on PC and never had it on mobile. (Must be a hard feature to develop!) * Why the extra tap to JUST see my playlists in my library. This was the worst design choice recently and incredibly annoying. Stop wasting time on useless features like ""canvases"". Nobody gaf about that."
Songs nd lyrics are helpful but the ad is seriously killing the vibe... I got 3 ad continuely for 30 seconds. I hate it Giving us free music by easy search but ruining it ad is bad that's why i gave 2 star
"Sounds very clear, however its completely outweighed by the cumbersome UI, not being able to decide the order of music to play, not being able to skip more than six songs an hour, (why?) And for the love of God, STOP ADDING SONGS FOR ME!"
"it's an amazing music app, I love it and quit all my other music subscriptions but this one I just love how every update for my Galaxy S9 fixes one this and royally messes up another. like either the song will randomly pause, will needa pause and play to hear some songs are first, but those are fixed the newest is that it doesn't load the song on the bottom so you can't click the song your currently listening to or everything you click just takes your back to the playlist you where last looking"
Plays songs that are not in my playlist when I click on the play button in the playlist not the first time this has done this. This issues keeps persisting. I don't want to listen to songs not in my playlist. Fix plz
Was hoping to get away from Amazon music. But this app only allows you to listen to whole albums and artists you can't actually build your own playlist. Glad I realized that before I spent money on it.
"2 stars because when I try to play one of the popular songs on my fav artist profile, it shows names. I liked it when there was a list of their popular songs. But now it's just song names and a green button that plays a song that's from a different artsit that I don't listen to. Change it back to the popular list of songs instead of the names"
The app doesn't play songs after clicking the next button
Update the boring UI and UX please. The Apple Music App for Android has a better UI than this.
"Not as good as it was, all mixes that ""suit"" me is nothing new, all just my liked songs list."
"This app is good I had a good experience and I didn't have problem with the adds also it was quite ok , but recently the app is not working properly it doesn't show my Playlist or liked songs I have lot of them and it's getting annoying. I thought Uninstaller and again download would do but it's no avail. Please do something about it I have lot of Playlists."
"The UI is terrible and always gradually gets worse over time. Once my student discount is up, I'm cancelling. I'm tired of this terrible app."
"So broken. So buggy. I have to restart the app 3 times before I can tap anything, before the UI shows up. Just unusable. Such a shame because I used to live Spotify so much. Don't know why the user experience has declined so much."
"The recent update doesn't allow to see the unplayed podcast episodes, or the titles, as easily. I have to click into every show to see what the episoe title is and there is no longer a button to quickly mark an episode as played. The interface before the update was perfect."
The app requires updates too frequently and the pause and forward options disappear constantly. For the cost it should be more reliable!!!
Podcast playback interface is clunky and not intuitive
"I've been using this app for a while and have always enjoyed what it has to offer, that was until recently! For some strange reason Spotify has started cutting out, mid song and for no apparent reason. Another is you select an album to play, yet after about the 3rd song, it randomly skips to a completely different artist. I'm not sure what changes you made in your last update, but it's made the app worse and I hope that you fix these issues quickly before I cancel my subscription"
App continues to undergo many negative UX changes to the point where it constantly crashes or breaks on a brand new phone
I love this app but the play button just disappears and reappears when ever it wants and that has become super annoying. You figure something that I pay for would work like it should. Also please stop moving the interface all around I can't find anything!
I pay my monthly and don't want to hear ads. Yet for quiet some time I get at least two ads during podcasts. Lame
I am paying for this app. I work in remote areas with no cell service and it simply refuses to work. Downloaded playlists are still on the phone but it seems to still need an internet connection to load playlists. It randomly closes/crashes several times a day. Podcast interface is just counter intuitive. Sound quality is decent though and the selection of music is good.
Whenever I search a song and click play button never the selected song is played always other songs are played instead of selected one
Yes I love using Spotify however ever since you have made the update so every play list is automatically set to shuffle it has become quite frustrating not everyone likes to shuffle their music. Change it back.
imagine if EA had a streaming service and the skip forward button was behind s paywall. welcome to Spotify
Everything was working just fine then one day to the next the app would not respond....and nothing would play....the buttons wouldn't respond.....unistalled then reinstalled the app and well to my surprise all my play lists had been wipped clean......so no not a very happy customer at the moment 😞😞
"I love Spotify and we have a family premium but as other reviewers have mentioned, sometimes the song play button disappears from the bottom so you can't check the queue etc or skip songs - this is usually restored by restarting my phone but I shouldn't have to do that everytime. Songs randomly pause sometimes and the shuffle feature doesn't always work or repeats songs in the same order constantly. It used to work perfectly fine but has been having problems more recently on my android phone :("
"Spotify use to be my favorite app but not anymore thanks to the fact that u can only forward six songs per hour except if u are using Spotify premium which requires payment that I can not afford. An App for the financially-abled, hmmm."
The app was pretty functional until recently. When I opened my usual playlist and went for a random song in the middle of the Playlist it would play properly. But after that you'd expect the song right after to play right? No. The song to play right after is the first song on my playlist and I can't get this to stop. This is quite aggravating
"WOW, THESE REVIEWS!!! SPOTIFY ARE NOT LISTENING!!! Glitchier and glitchier.. Has always been a sterling app but something has changed. These days it randomly stops and most frustratingly, will be playing, but the play button has the 'triangle' and not the pause button, so you can't stop what is playing! The only way to get it to stop is turn the phone off. Very poor. Edit: And the 'tell us more' option can be filled in but not submitted. Ironic, hilarious and a further disappointment."
I'm sorry I love Spotify but the new update is so bad it doesn't let me add songs I want from the preview anymore and I can't pre listen to 5 seconds of them anymore and it's just so horrible and the layout is just ruined I wish I could un update this. Please fix this to back how it was
Play button is all the time dull white when I use my phone darkmode on.
My Spotify isn't working at all. When I try the new update this problem arises. Please do something about it as my earlier experience was amazing. But now it's totally ruined. Pls see to it
"samsungI wanted to listen to a song only released here instead of yt and got this app. after I created an account, I find the song and press the green play button and nothing happens. Like it changes to the ⏸ pause sign but then no song or sound or anything. I clicked on the artists profile to go to their page and im just stuck at a black screen with a green spiny loading circle. then I tried the browser option and when I clicked the ▶️ button, it started playing a completely different song? 😐"
"Great service, awful apps. Consistently terrible UI. Any changes to your network connection can make even offline available playlists extremely slow to access, if at all."
I don't like that I'm forced to listen to your suggested songs when listening to an album...like bro my vibe is ruined
"Spotify is proof that you can steal billions of dollars from artists for a fraudulent business structure and still not turn out a halfway decent app. Play controls disappear from the UI when connected to bluetooth devices, and playlists play out of order even with shuffle turned off. Artist radio playlists do not allow you to select a song or listen on order, only shuffle play (but it's not the same set of songs from the playlist for some reason). Also, pay artists better and oust your vile CEO."
I get a hesitation every minute or two. This is very disturbing and ruins the listening experience.
"Boring UI and poor sound quality, I prefer apple music."
"I've been using his app for years and it has been my most used app on my phone. Great song suggestions and wide selections of podcasts. Recently, the playbar keeps disappearing resulting in not being able to control the play, pause, rewind and forward. This issue can only be fixed if I close the app and reopen, sometimes multiple times of closing and reopen needed. This happens 10-20 times throughout the day and has become a real nuisance. Please fix this bug."
"Playing songs on shuffle mode in default, off-button is hidden from the player screen. I'm not Adele to ask you but turn it back next to play button!"
"Latest version is broken... There is no longer a start pause slider so the music or podcasts constantly stop. And can't be controlled from headphones or side buttons. Also, Spotify no longer works on ford Sync3 android auto since the latest update. I'm using Samsung s20+ and latest OS."
"I used to really love this app but Inow can't use the start, stop, pause buttons and I can't skip parts of songs and have no option other than shuffle play. If Spotify could fix this issue it would be 5🌟."
"When works it's fine,but it won't pause,stop when required. I actually have to force stop the app and restart it.then it works for a while until I'm forced to restart it again."
"It's unbelievable how bad this app manages to be. Horrific design, especially for podcasts, barely functional search, and huge numbers of app-breaking bugs which you can read about in other reviews."
"I love the app in general, but lately there's been a lot of glitches: I can't queue anything properly, quick action bar disappears sometimes, it even stops playing on it own. I'm up to date on the updates, restarting the app or my phone doesn't help..."
"Lately when listening to podcasts, it keeps stopping and I'm having to go into the app rather than the drop down as that button doesn't work. This is very frustrating especially when I pay for the app. If I'm doing something, I don't want to keep getting out my phone to press play again. It's the simplest problems that become the most frustrating!"
No update recently but constant freezing and is not displaying music im currently playing on my phone or car def ruined my workout today
"Great app when on premium only. It's a little cluttered & disorganized design but not bad. It is a great music app when you pay for the service. Love the Playlist, music choices. Etc. However, I'm financially strapped & went to free option. The amount of ads is absurd. Most times it is 2-3 ads which isn't bad but 3 is pushing it. But I just had 8 ADS in a row between songs. It has happened twice in the last hours. WAY TOO MANY ADS. Would be 5 star i was paying for service"
"The app is good but I'm facing a from past two months Problem while updating the app. I'm not able to update the app as it get stuck on ""Installing"" And then it comes to the starting point. Also I'm not accessible to Song Sharing on Social Media feature. Am quite frustrated from this. Please resolve the problem soon"
"Music stops suddenly and by itself. Very annoying when you are busy working or cooking and have to put that on hold to grab your phone or shout to your Smart device to resume Spotify. Also the player menu with the buttons to pause, rewind and fastforward very often disappear so rewinding a podcast becomes mission impossible. This has been going on for months and is really unacceptable for a paid service. I love how user-friendly the app is but the two points above are significant failures."
"As a premium member I'm thinking of cancelling the subscription after the last update. The app has been buggy. The app started playing without the usual panel with the seek bar and other buttons and I cant pause it other than killing the app. While the app is playing, spotify somehow doesn't register it as playing, so sometimes i don't even know what music is playing. Im using the app on Samsung S20+. Whether I am continuing my subscription is dependent on how quickly this is resolved."
"Love the app design, but yeah, music keeps pausing or stopping, also the song itself that is playing will disappear off the app, so I can't pause it or go back 15 secs."
"Trash app. When playing a podcast it it starts but you can't pause it, only the play button appears. You can't view any video that goes along with what you are listening to. The only way to get it to stop playing is to complete close out of the app."
Somewhat underwhelming. I am coming back from Deezer and I find Spotify UI too busy and disorganised. App is bugged. I often cannot stop or skip songs because controls would have gone.
"I have been having many issues with this all. I JUST re-downloaded it and it has changed quite a bit, I cannot listen to ANY song of my choice. When I click on a play list, it plays a song I've never even heard of! Spotify, get your stuff together."
"TLDR: the music app doesn't let me play the music I want but premium is good. Premium costs £10 per month and free is unusable. Genuinely appalling that you can't see which songs are in an album and even when you play that album you'll get other songs from the artist that Spotify just adds in for no reason, you'd think creating a playlist would get round this but Spotify still adds random songs and when I play it it will instead show me a song they recommend. Premium fixes these issues so 2 star"
Why can't I turn off shuffle. They tell me to open the song and there will be a button to turn it off but I don't see it
"Overall fine. Clean interface, user-friendly, easy to navigate, good colouring (makes reading and screen navigation easy). BUT - and it's a HUGE BUT, which I see others have noted.....the shuffle function within a playlist simply doesn't work - and never has. It repeats the same tracks it did every time it's previously been used in that list. I have quite a few playlists, all with many tracks. Regardless of playlist, it plays the same things in the same order as the time before. Infuriating."
Everytime you build a nice playlist Spotify is only too good to people and they take the reigns and delete all your downloads and playlists.
"Quite bad, the xbox version is way better. M = Mobile, X = Xbox. M: very hard to use. X: very easy to use. M: You can't play specific songs. X: You can select any song. M: You need premium to skip alot and specific songs. X: You don't need premium. M: Lots of ads and premium. X: very few ads, most as 2 ads every few skips. I could have rated 2.5 if I could but we can't rate hold stars."
"Genuinely annoying how they add song for ""personalisation"" And ehen I skip those songs it says ""instead of skipping those songs lets change the playlist."" Other than that a pretty solid app with fairly good suggestions."
"Love Spotify, and usually this app is the best, but as others have stated; the control buttons disappear and podcasts stop for no reason, which is only fixed by deleting and reinstalling the app. First world problems for sure, but highly annoying nonetheless, especially when paying for prime."
"Android user - there are loads of glitches with this app... player bar disappears, shuffle button missing....sort it out please"
Last two updates have ruined the app. Turns off mod song and shuffle is stuck on. So frustrating.
"I can't see the play, pause, forward, backwards buttons...they just disappeared!"
For some reason the widget on my home screen quit working and it no longer allows me to skip or play again from my lock screen?
"The latest update ruined it. Crashes, controls disappear, won't switch to online after offline, and more."
The App is amazing but the newest update has been quite Annoying. When I'm trying to play my playlist it always goes to some recommended songs which I can't skip.
"The music options are great, podcasts are great, but functionally it doesn't work half the time. You play a song and there is a bug that causes the app not to show the pause and play buttons. They don't reappear until I restart my phone. Have to force close the app to stop playing anything. Can't skip any songs. Really an app breaking bug."
"Recent update needs urgent bug fix!! Control bar missing, music glitches when I turn off phone screen or navigate apps, and sometimes my phone will just start playing randomly now. I don't know what you guys did, but a quick fix would be to just restore an update to last patch. Love Spotify but can't use (or want to pay for) an app like this...."
"I got Spotify premium but why can't I click the shuffle button multiple times, now it just starts nd pauses the song. Plz fix its annoying"
"I've seen worse UI and UX work on other apps, but not many."
I'm rating this 2 stars whenever I keep skipping the song that is NOT in my playlist its still keeps letting me listen to another song that isn't in my playlist its quite annoying.. It's just I can't buy the premium but I want to listen to my own playlist so please fix it.
"Compared to the desktop app, this app is terrible. Bugs everywhere, too many extra ""features"" being added while the core functionality gets worse. For example regularly the play/stop buttons just simply disappear. Only way to stop the audio is forcing closing the app. This doesn't happen on other audio apps. ""Offline mode"" doesn't work, you could download something and get on a plane and the file won't play."
"I dont know whether i am using this app for listening music or listening to adds!! After ever 60 seconds of addd, if i change the 2-3 song quickly, it gives the yt shorts add again withing fur seconds.. it seems like i would have to uninstall this app. Cause its really annoying."
"July 6th, 2022. Just came back to Spotify today around 03:37, I'm not amused on how the Audio Devices I'm using currently onto Bluetooth and AUX Cable too, I used to have a quite different experience than a lower mono-audio about now. By the way; the sound was needed to be up around 94% oye. Ad's are fine but gives you 30 minutes of listing to music; But other devices that I use this app isn't the same, I only use shuffle mode."
"7.5.22 App has been glitchy the last few days. Podcasts stop every 10 minutes. No control buttons, can't pause or back up. Normally this is fixed in short order but it's been too long. I mostly like this app. One ask I have is to make autoplay settings separate for podcasts. Depending on where I am when I select an episode, a new one may or may not autoplay at the end. I want autoplay for music but not for podcasts... please and thank you! Also shuffle available from the top of all playlists?"
"Loved spotify and have used premuim, meaning I pay, for years now. HOWEVER, for at least two months now the app has been crashing, randomly pausing my music, and not displaying any banner or display for the active audio. I've been very patient and stuck with an app I have appreciated, but that might change if spotify does not fix these issues soon."
"It keeps randomly pausing podcasts, it's not allowing me to play a searched song, and pause/pause button often dissappears which means I have to close app and start again. And all this using the paid version."
Queue related things have been bugging for many months. Songs randomly skipping and queue sometimes just wiping itself. Adding songs sometimes deletes other songs from queue. Really annoying as queuing is one of core functions.
"I have a Samsung A20 that recently had a software update and since then the app is completely unusable. My entire library is gone and I have no history so release radar and discover weekly along with other personal playlists are completely gone. I've uninstalled and reinstalled to app several times. I tried going offline o n both mobile and desktop and reconnecting hoping they sync. Logged in and out over and over. I'm annoyed to say the least. UI is version 3.1, android version 11."
The User Experience and UI of the mobile app is awful. Lots of missing features and functions such as sorting playlists are just hidden behind menu's and menu's and it's a very bad experience when compared to the desktop version.
"It's okay, not great, not terrible, very okay, a bit janky on Android, sometimes stops working when I lock my screen, or just stops playing. Bit dissapointing for a paid service. The general UI experience is also weak, it'd be cool for a free app made by some stoner kids, but not a premium paid-for music service. Also no Raspberry Pi OS (ARM64 support is really REALLY quite lame.)"
You have to work on the UI also music suggestions are weak and not showing the new releases.
"Previously was good. Recent times (a year - last months) various technical problems that continue. Audio stops playing randomly. You can also suddenly lose the control buttons of currently playing audio (you lose whole player view; audio controls and info what is playing and progress bar) and have to shutdown and restart the app to hope to get controls back etc. Now I noticed problems with skip buttons. Everything might work ok for a while, then problems continue."
"Your app needs a MAJOR redesign.The Joe Rogan podcast deal didn't make podcasts better on your app. Try a redesign of the UI that makes sense. That makes it easier to discover new things.Make it a more social and Connected network. Some new button deisgns, colour schemes, symmetry, minimalist.DARK AND LIGHT MODE. I can go on forever.Pump that cash into a user friendly design and make it available both for iOS and Android at the same time.Give users control.windows Xp media player visualisation."
"Love it but the button to report explicit content don't work. I don't mind the explicit content but it's nice to hit the block explicit button around the kids. Sucks when bad words get through. IT'S BEEN YEARS, FIX IT!!!"
So difficult to play songs and keep songs... Not suitable to play specific songs you want but good for random playlist
It used to be great but now it's restricting and quite unusable it's forcing us users to go premium if you don't change it like before I will delete this app.
Everything is v.well but when i search a song then single song isn't shown as search result then i played album then it's auto set on loop then the song isn't played another artist song played i don't know why but please change this feature or guide user.
"The app has been fine for me ever since I downloaded it (probably 2 years ago), but since 2 days ago it hasn't been working for me at all. Only opens with the logo showing up in the middle of a black screen, then never responding after. Tried all the things I could in reddit and guides online, same result. Uninstalled multiple times and reinstalled only to be met with the same exact result. Tried deleting cache and data, still the same thing. Hope my app gets fixed :("
"After the update I cannot play the music I want it just keep playing the song that are suggested and not on my playlist,please remove this feature it ruins the whole app."
I keep having to reinstall. App will not function normally for over a month. It plays with the button on pause and there is no way to stop it besides force stop...or uninstall. I pay for premium. About to change to another app.
"Spotify is good for listening to songs in the background and is a really good app for music, but I rated it 2 stars because sometimes I accidentally press the don't recommend the song button and even after I change it back to not be it doesn't let me listen to it. If they fix this I will bring it to 5 stars but right now, it's 2 stars"
Don't know happaned to this app but it is slow now.....to play or find a song takes forever now... it is very irritating and i seriously consider unsubscribing and quitting using it
UI is terrible + app doesn't even work half the time.
UI issues are back in full force
"They blatantly lie about the free version, making me distrust them so much I won't uograde to premium. They claim that fewer than 15 tracks on a playlist in free mode means they'll add songs to the playlist. I have >20 & they keep adding tracks, including tracks I already hid. Plus, they are STILL one of the worst in paying artists, so I'll continue to pay Apple Music despite its glitches (pays almost double). App's also not intuitive, and I won't pay extra for something misleading and greedy."
"Some UI hiccups quite often (freezes, UI inresponsive etc.). Also, keeps asking Bluetooh permission all the time, this is super annoying! If I say no (actually not an option, only ""Maybe later""), the app should not keep pushing for an access. I find it little shady that app wants to constantly spy the BT devices near me."
"Overall it's an amazing music app. However, i have recently been unable to see some of the buttons and icons when operating the app. It definitely looks weird and incomplete. It would also be nice if non-premium users would get a chance to join in on the group sessions. I'd have given a 5⭐ but I'll do a 2⭐ until the issue is resolved."
Whenever Im hearing a playlist its always shuffled but the problem is there is no shuffle button. And I couldn't see the songs that were included in the playlist. PLEASE FIX THIS. Its stressing me out.. Edit: I'm sorry I keep whining but please fix this.. Please please please please please please please
I like the app because it is good for listening to music but there is just kn one issue I have I keeps signing me out of my account randomly and it is quite hard to get back into it when does this. Can you please fix that one issue.
"It sucks, you can barely listen to the music you want because of shuffle, you only get 6 skips, on pc its good so i am giving 2 stars, and ads just ruin the experience, not even youtube or sound cloud has that many ads and in those you can skip as much as you want"
Finding the play controls should never be an issue but with this app it annoyingly is. Solution: quit the app.
"Fix the bugs. Crashing, podcast episodes not playing after one another and the few times they do, jumping all over the place. Notifications for podcasts are either non existent or show up a week late. Music UI is clumsy and weirdly organized"
"This last 6 months, the app has been crashing and/or freezing daily requiring a forced stop. I have tried reinstalling, bit the issue persists. Very annoying."
"How do you get the bloody thing to stop automatically playing when my car connects to Bluetooth!!??? My God it's such a pain!!! Close the app? Nope doesn't work. Search in vain for a stop or exit button? Nope. Cant find anything. Uninstall app until you want to use it again, then reinstall? Yep. Only thing I've found that works. Now also adding the frustration of no way to rewind a podcast if you miss a few minutes and want to go back and hear it again. Have now uninstalled for good."
"The Equalizer can't be controlled but in iOS, equilizer can be controlled. Without equilizer the music experience is ruined"
Quit changing to the damn radio every time I touch a song. If that is what I wanted then I would do that
"I use to like spotify until this new update, whatever this new update is it stoped me from picking the song i wanted to listen to because spitify ruined my playlist. It now shows a preview of the song i want to listen to and they removed the queue for songs. The only way i can use my playlist now is if i connect to my console or tv."
"They say that this app is the front runner but it doesn't look so. The add to queue option is working in a very dumb manner. Whenever a song/ album/ playlist is required to be added to queue, it means to the end of the existing queue of songs. This is the logical thought for any layman. However Spotify adds songs next to the current song that is playing, this is a basic app mistake and i am thinking of cancelling the subscription i made. Hope they correct this basic mistake."
"The ""premium"" algorithm is hot garbage. The UI is deliberately cumbersome and ugly, and for whatever reason the developers think that ""playlist"" means shove a bunch awful songs into a carefully chosen list constructed by a paying customer. Would never recommend this to someone who actually likes music. If you just wanna listen to Joe Rogan, I guess it's ok."
"Please stop adding songs to my playlist 🙏 , you are ruining my day with those songs"
"The issues I have are with its compatibility with Google assistant. Half of the time when requested to play something, it plays a completely unrelated song. For example for a while when asked to play Kelly Clarkson, it would actually play Kelly CARSON, a largely unheard of cover singer... it's quite frustrating when all you want is hands free compatibility."
It quite working an I can't use. It.
"The app is saying all my Playlist are empty and won't let my listen to anything at all? Keeps saying ""try again"" and even after clicking that button it doesn't work."
"Sometimes it makes me think this is the worst UI with buggy music app, I've been a premium member for almost an year still this thing won't load interface or songs properly most of the times"
"I've been using Spotify for quite a long time. But lately whenever I play a playlist, it doesn't play the songs that are suppose to be made by the artist. It just plays other songs that aren't even in the playlist. I only want to listen to songs by my fav artist playlist but it keeps playing other songs."
"Used to be good, since the UI chamges it sucks."
"Decent. The algorithms for making daily mixes can be super repetitive, even when you try to like or move liked songs into your own playlist. There really should be a dislike button instead of a ""hide song from the playlist "" function because that song will later show up in another playlist. User interface is nice and easy to use."
"Personally, the latest update is one of the strangest updates ever in history of bad updates ever in companies. How are you gonna force non-premium users to use shuffle all the time? That's stupid. I don't want to have to listen to multiple other songs that don't even go with the song I'm trying to play. they ruined playlists with this update. c o p o r a t e g r e e d"
"I have no idea if something's wrong with my Phone, but the new GUI is so confusing now, I can't choose specific songs on my playlist and it forces me to listen to suggestions, this is not improving the app in any way, shape, or form, please revert this back to the old GUI."
Please where did the shuttle button go??? Or is it just my phone or what?? As in what the hell is going on?? How would one always play the same songs all the time#borinnnnnnnnggggggggg
Can't rewind can't play the specific song I want why is it always the shuffle button can't I play the songs that I actually want?
"Through android auto, Spotify is loud for the first couple of seconds. Then the volume dips, and the music is only as loud as you speak, despite being cracked to the max. All other apps through AA or the radio/Sirius in the car don't do this. Why does Spotify keep shting the bed? Problem solved: bought a tesla with built in Spotify."
I was using Spotify mainly for listening to podcasts but lately it has become unusable. It quits randomly or appears to not play anything when playing. It needs fixing.
Bad interface design. Hard to navigate and not intuitive.
"Please, fix this😭, I can't even play a single FULL SONG, everytime I click on that particular song, it only has it's trailer or it only plays about 10 seconds of the whole song. Plus I can't play my playlist because of that shuffle button...I swear... I'm crying my balls out for not figuring how to play a song.. its- it's really really really difficult to use this app especially as a non-premium user... I'm looking forward to a better version of this app😭😭😭"
constant changes to the ui which do nothing to improve the actual app. it is now so incredibly bloated and slow that it sometimes takes 15+ seconds to load even if it's already running. There are many times where I cannot access my music or podcasts without shutting the app completely and reopening it. They add more ads to the podcasts all the time. Why am I getting ads? I paid for the subscription specifically to avoid ads. If it gets much worse I may have to find an alternative.
"Why is there no way to view what songs you have in your queue anymore? The button that would bring up your queue is grayed out. I've added songs to the queue and it plays them, so I know my queue isn't empty."
App is ok but recently been having to reset device or reinstall. Playlists are quite narrow
"The app is good but, I think it's too restricting. For example, I played my fav song in my playlist but somehow, it played the other different song in my other playlist. Second thing is that, my cousin purchased the premium and it doesn't even show the download button or neither a pending bar for the download. It also doesn't show if the music is downloaded or not. It's a shame that the app has great performance but it's too restricting."
"App has a fault where the play bar vanishes and I have no control to play or stop. Support service have had me on the chat page for 5 hours so far with no progress, this involved me waiting to send a video of the screen without a play button before they would take more action. It still happens and I have so many half finished podcasts I can no longer find"
I will give this a 2 star app cause It plays a different song that it doesn't belong to my playlist and I cant find the repeat button plus fix this
"I understand that mobile apps are design to be handle by touch, but I think that your web player or your tablet versions could have drag and drop, making it easy to reorder playlists and songs in a playlist, instead of going through a menu. Obviously Windows version is more user friendly in this sense. Spotify could be such a great app if the developers understood how their clients use it. Please add drag and drop to mobile apps, or at least to the web player. I'm and android user, by the way!"
"(not a play store bot) This app is good, however some music I try to find doesn't seem to be available meaning that if you have a specific song you like to hear there's a possibility that it won't be In. Not to mention all of the ads that really ruin the experience, they're frequent as well. Overall try out this app if you want, but I do recommend it sense the music can be played without being in the app and there isn't anything else out there better."
"I loved this app up until they made stupid changes to appease Adelle 🙄🤬 Seriously, put the app back to the way it was where I could skip a song I didn't want to hear at the moment! Now, in place of that button it just pauses/restarts the same song 🙄 Almost caused a wreck trying to find out to skip a damn song now!"
"Poor user experience lately, it doesn't show any play-bar so I could control a play and it's very frustrating, I have to close the app every time I want to pause a song and re-open and find it again when I want to play it - instead of having the pause/play option! Plus I can't move on different times of the play so if I want to go back to a middle of a podcast episode - on Spotify I just can't! Is it going to be fixed?? That's embarrassing consider tha apps cost and how fundamental the feature."
I Trying to play a song on my liked Playlist and I'm only hearing the preview of the song I have to press the shuffle button just to listen to my music.
"It used to be amazing! Like I had no complaints for my OnePlus 3t and OnePlus 8 but recently it's just become close to unusable, half the time the player you get on the home screen doesn't appear then when you go on the app you can hear music but there is no way to stop it without force closing the app, and there are so many small UX issues, eg. when scrolling it doesn't always allow you to get to the bottom, for an app I pay £10 a month for after 5 years I'm really considering moving."
"It's quite frustrating to have Spotify when you're on freemium,every time I try to listen to a song sometimes ads like to cut in,in the middle of the song and completely skip over to the next song And everytime a song finishes,I'm left with a ad and another ad,done with the song,and strings if ads again,rinse and repeat"
Why did they remove the ability to exit the app by right or left swiping the spotify player widget on the phones notification bar? At least add an X button or something so we can easily close out the app. YouTubes notification bar widget has a X button.
"loved this app for the longest time, but the layout changes are vile. it's hard to navigate, the shuffle and loop buttons are far too small, the play/pause and skip are so weirdly put together it's hard to use. almost no new layout updates have been good recently and i'm questioning if it's worth paying for it anymore."
It's very slick but i want to let uh know that IN the playlist we don't get any option to customize the song's sequence the problem is the default sequence which automatically organizes them as per the uh choose them but we're not able to toggle them as per. Our. Requirements. It's very very complicated to do this initially while. Creating. A playlist. Manually....so please look forward into it like YouTube you're able toh arrange the sequence. into the playlist please. Drop these small feature
"i genuinely cannot understand who made the decision to not allow users to play samples of songs before adding them to playlists, but it makes creating playlists and discovering new music so difficult. im not sure if this is just the experience for android users or free users, but i need this feature back."
"App keeps playing up, keeps stopping what is playing & marks things as played that haven't finished. Often can't pause things as the play button doesn't work properly. Often doesn't show details of what is playing with the bar at the bottom so you are unable to search through podcasts etc."
Way too many ads. Plus the app UI has way fewer features than the full website.
"Portrait mode on the Samsung Galaxy S8+ doesn't show right. The play, shuffle, and other buttons are showing ontop of each other please fix!!!!"
"Premium user so not sure if that changes my app functionality in any way. Video podcasts are still broken on my LG VELVET 5G, even after updating to Android 12. This has been the case for over two months now. Playing a podcast with video (with all settings set properly) only shows a black screen whether in the player preview or in full screen. Spotify also often locks up or plays something without it showing in the player, essentially ""phantom playing"" media which requires a restart."
My play button and previous/next buttons are all messed up after One of the recent updates. The pause/play button is all the way to the right with the back/next buttons pushed all the way to the left. Ugly and a little unsettling.
Recently played ui changed and i hate it bring back the small 6 icons at the top or im staying downgraded
"The feature to share on other devices is becoming quite annoying. I live in flats with shared wifi, and there is constantly a pop up asking if I want to connect to someone else's device. It's annoying if I accidentally click that. Can there please be a way to turn this feature off."
Need to stop play button
"Don't know what happened with this app. Used to work fine. Now it constantly uses mobile data even if it's turned off in settings. Sometimes play lists (song radios) are being modified every 3 songs (download whole playlisty, play 3 songs, playlist is modified, requiring 60% of songs to be downloaded to play)"
Please fix the UI. Everyone I know has the bottom title/pause bar disappear regularly.
"Who thought putting the pause button to the left was a good idea...if it ain't broke don't fix it, these ui designers are just looking for something to do"
I'm a premium user but the app itself fails a lot and the way buttons are suddenly changed from position on screen is a pain in the @$$ been using YouTube music and works well plus you got the videos...
"I love the playlist it creates for friends to share music, but it's very very buggy. It was adding random audio book chapters that neither of us had EVER listened to, nor had in our library. I genuinely thought someone had hacked my account and added random things! The offline mode just doesn't work. I have to turn my data on whenever I open the app until I get a podcast/downloaded music playing, then I can turn it off. Now I'm unable to search for anything online or offline 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"Used to have no problem playing any songs, but suddenly the app crashes everytime I started to click the play button! I have to restart my phone every once in a while due to this issue. Please fix it!"
"Hello, I've recently experienced problems with playing both music and podcasts with the Spotify app on my phone. It just quits. I can't play anything. When I tap the play button my screen turns white, then the app crashes. I've tried reinstalling it, but the problem is still there. Please issue a fix asap"
"Great app, but they make it very, very difficult to make any sort of change to your account. Logging in, changing my premium plan, adding a family member to a family plan--all things that have no easy way to accomplish, not even having the option within the app itself. Instead you have to go onto their website which is just about as straightforward. So long as you never have to do anything with your account, Spotify is awesome. But the frustration quickly brings a 5 star app to 2."
"Just now updated. After, always logged out and cannot play the music if we push the PLAY button."
Enhance button disappearing and lack luster customer service.
No progress on this offline mode...: Offline/slow internet loading should be quicker. Why does the loading spinner happen for so long when I'm looking for offline library content? Podcast playing on downloaded offline mode is busted. Thanks!
Why are the control buttons missing? Why do updates make the app suck. My podcasts are getting annoying to hear because I can't control to rewind.
"Recently transitioned from Apple to Samsung (IOS to Android). While the UI is the same, the back end is a different story. The IOS version of this app is far better and more responsive. On this device (S22 Ultra), I cannot scrub through songs via Bluetooth on Ford Sync, the function does not work. When I scrub through songs manually through the app the bar moves but the song remains at the same spot. When I pause the song the bar goes back to the original position. This need to be fixed."
"Very confusing UI, hard to find things like my queue, podcasts I'm following, etc. Can't seem to turn off shuffle by default. I'll play an album, turn off shuffle, then the next song is not from the album I'm playing? Very bizarre behavior and overall bad UX. It's a shame, because the content is great and the desktop version has a more straightforward ux (though not great there, either)."
Used to be better. Now I'm getting 2 ads per song back to back alot... Like alot. Also the intuitive selections seems not that intuitive.
I know the designs are beautiful but when I play a song another song plays I get annoyed because I can't even listen to the song I want. I'll just delete it instead of getting stuck and then update then it doesn't even work properly.
"It works for getting you music, but man, the shuffle sucks A**!! I can have my liked songs playing on shuffle mode as it will play the same group of about 20 songs again and again. Those 20 songs change each time you hit the re shuffle button"
Big L for spotify i was listening to mgr when i pressed the shuffle button some random indan music destroyed the vibe
Seriously spotify your not letting me play the songs that I want please fix it I want to view my playlists but it's just showing up the edit playlist button and the names of the songs I would like to listen to the songs on my playlists and see them listen to the whole thing not just a part of it. Can you not put on a random song seriously when I'm on my liked songs it's doing the same thing Please fix this it's annoying.
"Can't play any song, if i play a song it will quit."
"I can't dislike songs, I don't know if that's just because I can't find the button or what but I don't like some songs that end up in my daily mix, I also can't figure out how to remove specific songs from my downloaded daily mix. Also also the songs stutter 2henevr I'm using other apps, much prefer my old music app"
It keeps playing songs I don't want i was listening to my liked song then it plays a suggested song and you can play the other songs in your playlist you can play it but it's just like 5 seconds that's why I'm giving it a two it ruins my time on finding music
What if while I was listening to a Daily Mix it didn't change? Also I'm glad there's no shuffle button at the top of albums anymore. A big green play button is nice. 👍
App is unresponsive with frequent freezes and crashes. Unreliability makes frustrating to use what is meant to be a paid service. Update: with a new phone many of the glitches apear to be fixed however still experience the occasional graphical ui error.
"This app is great but its going in the wrong direction, its removing many features that were useful and the community clearly doesn't like the changes but they aren't adding them back. Now, when you press add songs on a playlist it takes you to the menu with recommended songs, liked songs etcetera which is great but the quick play feature is gone, how am I supposed to know what the song sounds like, they have made that useless now and the sessions are messed up, as well as so many glitches"
"No man Spotify, you are such a good app, but why did you change the layout of the ""previous, play"" and ""next"" buttons? It's awkward to look at. Please give me an opinion to change it back to normal in the settings atleast coz my OCD is Hella triggered 😭 🙏"
overall great app by this new music control button layout is just awful. the play pause should always be in the middle and you'll find it in any other similar app. please revert the change
"Lame and constraining like YouTube as of late, forcing one to listen to music, not allowing skipping through or directly choosing what to listen to half the time. Gives me the motivation to but CDs or mp3s again and build a collection."
"The last like three or four update of Spotify have been the buggiest, most unreliable builds I have had to use to-date."
"I'm a monthly subscriber and the pause button and other buttons tend to disappear, only fix is to reboot your whole phone when that happens... please update.. I'm on a Samsung galaxy s21 ultra"
"spotify please let people with the normal version enjoy music and stay happy with the basic functions you provide just like any other app does. i can't play songs and even the playlists look different, whenever i click on a song it gives me a preview and won't let me play it and only works normally when i've connected it to my laptop and only plays on shuffle. pls fix this. not everyone can afford premuim and you shouldn't be forcing anyone to buy it by taking away most of the basic functions."
"So many bugs! I have the paid version, but after playing something through google home or via bluetooth, I cannot stop the recording. The play and pause button do not work and I have to Force Quit to close the app."
It's just like a normal music app sames like yt but u can find a song easily in this app but I'm not quite surprised...
"I've tried many ways to fix the lyrics issue, however, my apps still doesn't show the lyrics. Quite disappointed with their service, I've paid for single premium service quite a long time. Now, it's time to look for other music player service."
"wow, they really took the ""enhance"" button from your liked songs playlist, always the dumbest ideas that make it through updates."
"LOL recommended songs all asian 😂😂😂PLEASE ADD ""PLAY NEXT"" OPTION (instead of just immediate or add to queue) PLEASE have option to remove podcasts suggestions!! PLEASE ADD ""ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO INTERUPT THE CURRENT SONG"" OPTION - for some people this is incredibly irritating if you accidentally skim a song it just starts to play :'( This premium app should have way more features and be more intuitive. ISSUES: why does it keep playing on phone speaker when I disconnect from Android Auto??"
I loveee Spotify but the new update is ruining my experience and Its hard to find songs in playlist. Also Spotify automatically added songs in my own playlist which I didn't like so I hope they fix it
"They remove the equalizer options, that makes it more suitable for better experience I wish they could improve it. The previous one is better.."
"Spotify isn't horrible but somebody tell me why the hell it adds songs to your play lists. I added those specific songs for a reason it shouldn't add more. And it's so un-intuitive, I don't know why the simple ability to choose the order of your songs and how many skips you get is locked behind a pay wall. 3/10"
Everything is fine but Spotify really need to step up their game when it comes to audio fidelity. The bit rate is horrifically low and regularly sounds awful. The quality is only suited as background noise or if being played through a Kinder Surprise speaker.
"Every update with this app has the same stupid bugs. Whether switching to the next song it freezes or loading it, it shows a blank playlist. Could the developers code that if your repeat song button is on when I skip a song let it keep that feature to repeat the song. Instead I have to take out my device from my pocket everytime whether exercising, walking or doing household tasks when connected to my home speakers."
I've used Spotify loyally for as long as I can remember but I just had 6 adverts then 2 songs and then 3 adverts on an app that is glitching every day. Random app closure and pause button disappearances.. the cost of this free app is becoming to much.
"who thought changing the layout of the music player is a good idea? it looks so unbalanced and ugly, like someone messed with the codes and ended up putting the pause play button to the side. bring the old layout back this isn't the revolutionary idea y'all think it is."
Constant crashes. Widget doesn't display proper info. Often requires a hard reset to work. Stops playing constantly. Needs optimization very badly. S22 Ultra.
"Always something going wrong with this app! Always crashing, pausing randomly, not loading album artwork, randomly turning shuffle on. Then there's potentially useful features like hiding tracks from albums seems to sometimes work, most of the time not. The queuing system is much less intuitive and helpful as other streaming services. Also uses an inordinate amount of battery, more then any other app - even something like Netflix. Nice design and Spotify wrapped is what keeps it from 1 star."
"I mean it works, but it also has extremely annoying quirks. For me, the app starts playing whatever i was last listening to when i plug my headphones in. Even if i close the app, even if i force stop it. I will have to stop renewing since the app has started interrupting me in my sleep when im wearing my headphones, and that's just not acceptable."
"The audio plays fine most of the time, other times it drops entirely and I have to force close the app to get it playing again. The video player is an absolute joke. Actually plays video like 20% of the time, and even then it's out of sync with the audio. Currently dealing with a new issue, the songs are playing but my ""Now Playing"" queue is empty, so I can't use my skip buttons on the lock screen or car stereo. Plus spotify won't pay labels enough to keep their client's comedy albums in library"
"BRING BACK THE SHUFFLE BUTTON. I read something about Adele saying that tracks are set up in a certain order to tell a story idk of it's true or not. While that may be the case my personal mix now no longer has the shuffle button and believe me when I say there is absolutely no trace of a story in there. If people want to hear this story they'll just play it in the right order, so bring back the shuffle button"
Please put the play/pause button back in the middle. It looks horrible on the side and it effects people more than you think 😭😭😭
"The app is slow offline and the UI is frustrating. It doesn't remove songs that I asked it to remove on the normal queue and also creates a dynamic queue which is idiotic. When I add to queue it should go in the normal queue. When I switch to desktop it re-shuffles the play list which means I never hear some songs! There's no ""play next"". There's no recently played music on the android app surprisingly, a feature that I love too. I have good things to say too and more bad but I'm out of space."
"The app used to work fine but lately its started to stutter, even when playing downloaded songs, whilst bugs sometimes result in the playing song bar dissapearing requiring the app to be restarted. very strange!!"
"Pls... I'm fine withe the rest, just fix the play/pause, forward and backward button. It was fine before. Now it just triggers me cause. a. It's not symmetrical, b. It doesn't even match the (much better) design when you visit the queue, stop making the UI ugly and worse. There wasn't even a good reason I could think of that you guys would do that."
"I found a bug. Earlier when I used to search for a song, after getting it in results, there used to be a 3 dot structure at the right side of the song results. On clicking on the 3 dots, I could get various options like Go to Album, Add to queue, etc. But with the last update, that 3 dots beside the search results has disappeared. It's very irritating. ☹️ Developers please fix this issue to improve the user experience. Other than that, the music experience is good."
"Sorting by genre not working. Searching within music requires multiple clicks. Why remove the search bar at the top? Stop changing your app, it wasn't broken why try to fix it?"
Last update is gay They moved the skip buttons and the play button to the left of the screen it's pretty darn stupid tbh EXAMPLE: ▶️⏮️⏭️ When it used to be like this ⏮️▶️⏭️
"Dear Spotify! I understand that from time to time, you need to refresh the looks of this app. But since I am alive - 30 years - I used some sort of machine or program to play music. Every! Single! One of them! Has a the following order for the playback control buttons: previous track - play/pause - next track. Why on earth you think that giving me a huge playbutton, on the LEFT and putting the prev./next button next to each other and in the MIDDLE would improve my UX?!?!?!"
"Some genius thought the interface needed a revamp, and changes the layout of all the play button. So frustrating!!!"
"I have had Spotify for 10 years and love the app, but what drives me nuts is that every once in a while they add a feature that auto-adjusts your volume for you and I HATE it; it's so annoying to set it up and then your music gets quieter when you didn't set it that way. The most recent add is the worst though, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TURN IT OFF. Spotify, fix this. I have always hated this feature and I need to be able to turn it off."
"I read the comments and I very much agree with Kylie Pemberton, I think it is so stupid and useless that they have done that , I want to pick my songs, I want to listen to my music not have to shuffle and get random songs it is stupid , I think it should be fixed VERY quick"
"I hate this update, I'm absolutely FUMING I am FORCED to listen to the songs on shuffle and the UI changes I cannot stand, please reverse the changes it's like I have no freedom on the app like I said once again I cannot stand the new UI change for playlists I have headaches thinking about it please reverse it back to the old one 😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
"Now what is this?!! Why the play button shifted to left? It's just making me uncomfortable. In the free version, ads are too much. I mean I know it's free, but no free version of a music streaming app throws 3 ads at a time."
"I have been forced to update must say the problems and comically Spotify has now become spotty in my experience hope this update will change my mind PS great before not sure now Not Updating until UI is back as was 2 yrs I've had premium & been happy no probs. Def recommend Spotify. But, too many of my apps have big mistakes in past. Now I never update until reviews seem positive & stable."
"Add an equalizer please. Trash interface. Add to playlist should be a two tap operation! It takes 3 taps and one scroll currently and all them are extremely slow to open. And why does the layout keep changing based on where I start playing? The like button is sometimes on the right otherwise on bottom left, very annoying. Good collection of songs otherwise a very sub-par app."
"I genuinely hate this so much. Not only does spotify (without paying money, so ads) force you into a set number of skips every hour which is just so dumb, it also doesn't like individual songs, if you want to listen to a single song just to listen to it, you have to go to a playlist with that song in it and hope it's in the first six shuffled song. You could put it into its own separate playlist, but when you have a song by itself, somehow it still plays other songs. It's idiotic"
"1/ Local file syncing has been broken forever. 2/ I'm not sure if this is A/B testing or permanent/final, but who thought moving the play button off centre was a good idea? It's best in the middle becasue it's the same distance from both edges of the phone, so it works with both hands. Moving it to the left in a world with a majority of right handed people is just terrible UX. 3/ Stop bugging me with Bluetooth. I DON'T WANT IT."
"I don't know if I'm just getting old, but found the UI really unintuitive. Also many too many adds"
"Suddenly moved the play button on full screen song view to the the left of the screen rather than the middle? Why would you want the main point of that screen at the side. Been getting progressively worse throughout the years, trying to force podcasts down your throat when you have no interest. Bringing back old features from years ago (new music notifs in app) is fine but not new"
Constant crashes and no track UI
"It was a great app until they decided to squeeze the play and skip buttons as far left as possible. There was nothing wrong with the old balanced design. I am right handed and have a large phone, it's now very impractical to use Spotify. Not to mention it looks horrendous. It doesn't look intentional, it looks more like somebody broke the interface, it really does look that bad."
"I love using spotify and I even have premium, but i hate the new update, they moved around the play and skip buttons for no reason. Im giving it a 2 star because, no one really asked for spotify to move them around."
Is it just me or does Spotify regularly just stop playing? This only seems to happen on podcasts. Also and the most frustrating is when the music is playing but there no play/pause rewind/fast forward ui?
"Disappointing. Poor integration with the Sonos speakers that i have - unreliable, doesn't detect the grouped speakers. Interface is not very intuitive, seem to end up hunting for functions most of the time. It insists on ""Shuffle Play"" for playlists - can't make it play in order. All in all, just frustrating and clunky to use. Really bad job of using any local music you might have - the Windows client has minimal functionality. The Spotify range of classical music is very poor too."
"2022, I genuinely hate this app. It currently is sitting at 5 GIGS of space- no downloads, clear cache, 5 gigs+... I am a paying customer, and it has gotten to the point now that I can't listen to a whole episode of anything without the app stopping. Why is that, Spotify? Spent it already? Podbean didn't do this. Himalaya didn't do this. Just yall. Hm. I'm only here because of lpn, but do not test me."
I just saw the new update and I don't like the design where the play button is on the left corner with the forward and rewind button beside it. It feels like it's squished together. I like the old design
Does anyone have to keep deleting and reinstalling this app? I do it at least once a week because the shuffle button keeps disappearing for my playlists! It's sooooo frustrating!
"This app has become so buggy!!! Stops playing out of the blue, doesn't show what I'm playing at times, the play/pause button stops working. What happened here?! The app used to work fine"
"I don't understand why I'm paying for a premium plan for an app that I constantly have to delete and re-install at least 3 times a week. The app will let me press the play button, but it doesn't let press pause or skip or anything else. Fix this!"
"The app has all kinds of issues. Sometimes downloaded music won't load, even though it's downloaded and should just appear. I have to turn off wifi and cellular to get downloaded music to appear. Other times, when I click on a song to play, spotify plays a completely different song off a different album. Sometimes the pause/play button and the pop up screen that shows the album video and lyrics doesn't load all together. I don't understand because I have a new Samsung s22+ and I have premium."
Quit adding songs that are not on my playlist and where is the shuffle turn off button at.
This app use to have just the right amount Commercial without needing to pay for premium but now u get anywhere between 4 and 8 Commercials that are about 1 min each or close to the only way around it is if you have the song on repeat. This app had gone down hill super quick in less then a year its gone from 2 Commercials to 4 now its between 4 and 8 that's about 4 to 8mins of Commercials between every 20 to 28 mins of music or less of u skip a song you don't get 30 mins Commercials free.
"I've had Spotify premium for five years now and have never once had a complaint. This new update on the other hand is really darn irritating. It's glitchy, sometimes doesn't open, or won't play songs at all. Even taking 5 or more minutes to load. That or all the playlists show up blank until restarting my phone itself. Next up is why on earth did they move the play button to the freaking left instead of in the middle of the forward and backwards buttons??? That's far from helpful, it sucks."
Who ever decided to remove the ability to optionally turn off or on the shuffle button Needs a kick in the shins.
"Works fine for my phone, however for the past few months I have been completely un able to use the desktop app. It tells me to ""Try reloading the page"" However, this does not fix anything. I'm stuck reloading it without end. I've tried trouble shooting to no avail. sucks. I also have a continue less issue of Spotify deleting all of my downloaded music, which is extremely annoying. This has happened about 7 times in the past two week and I've had to redownload my playlist each and every time. I do not have the time for this. I can only pin point it to being because I have a vpn, however that is a pretty garbage reason to delete all of my downloads. Fix this please, its extremely frustrating and has ruined my day each and every time. At this point, it's better to pirate your music. Easier once figured out and none of these issues happen."
"It's the definitely the go-to app for everything I want to listen to, but man is it buggy. On two different phones now, it will play, but not register that it is playing. It's almost like the app is frozen, but it still plays the audio. It's pretty frustrating because I listen to a lot of podcasts, so I'll have to force quit the app, reopen it, and scrub through to find my place again. This doesn't happen every time, but it happens a lot."
"the UI of this app (at least on the phone, which is where I use it the most) is very unintuitive. Where is the ability to select multiple songs in a playlist to perform bulk operations on them (remove, add to other playlist, like, etc.)? This alone would go a long way to make the app more user friendly. As it is right now, it's just a pain to use whenever I need to make bigger changes to my playlists."
Problems with WiFi in android tablet- requires constant restart of the app
"App now sux azzzzzz.. used to be great, now my ish keeps stopping, I can't find the player with now playing info, including a way to skip to the next song. I checked, there's no update available, buy that's exactly how the app is now behaving. I'm thinking I might have to cancel my premium family plan and go with Deezer instead."
"Could you please remove the heart button on the player, mainly on the locked screen player? Almost once in a while, when I want to skip a song, I end it up clicking on it by accident and messing up my playlist"
"The freak is wrong with the play button?? And also my liked song wont play the whole music its just played a very short freakin time, pls fix these problems."
"The service is good and all but this premium update is RIDICULOUS. Like seriously, in order to listen to a specific song/music of choice in ANY playlist is by buying premium to do it. Same gose for downloading music for offline mode. I beg you, get rid of this premium memebership nonsense as it servers no purpose, Spotify was doing absolutely fine until you had to ruin the experience of listening to any music of choice for free."
"The new update.. it ruined Spotify, I liked the old one better. :/ And it keeps adding random songs to my playlists, it's so annoying."
"Updating review: The latest update has changed Spotify from one of the most reliable apps on my device (Pixel 4A, 5G) to one of the least consistent. In about 8 years I've never had any issues with the service or app, which I see as one of my most trusted. Unfortunately the current build suffers frequent playback issues .. AUDIO ISSUES: buffering and stuttering, prioritising video over Audio (let me disable videos!). The device WiFi broadcasting frequently fails. All most recent reviews agree!"
Laggy and unresponsive UI.
"I never had an App that requires so many glitches and functions that require restarts that I keep on my phone. I have been premium for years, I love the idea of Spotify but there execution of the mobile app is garbage. Biggest issue is the videos not working. Any podcast that I start in the car will have video disabled even after I have existed the vehicle. And yes I have disabled car mode in settings. Disappointing."
There is a bug when playing a podcast with an ad. After the ad is done playing it plays the next episode instead of continuing the current podcast.
It's a good app ...but it couldn't fulfill my requirements....like i wanted all lyrics should be there ..but there are many songs without lyrics. If the song is Korean than the lyrics are also in that language with their own alphabets ...which irritates me ... atleast the lyrics words should be in eng alphabets..which can be read and learned by us ..
"SUPER buggy app, won't play half the time, have had to force quit and reinstall so many times"
why tf do my liked songs keep disappearing and start queuing the music in line and dont mess up the order . its not even playing some of my queued songs either
"bad software quality. slow, all around buggy, laggy, inconsistent, bloated. Crowded UI, with important features hidden several (laggy) clicks away. why does my music streaming app come with COVID info?!"
"very disappointed that im no longer able to add full albums to my playlist. only can add individual songs, same with queuing songs."
"I've been using Spotify for 5+ years and I loved the Premium package where you could pick a specific song from any playlist and now they've taken that option away even with the Premium Package, I used to love you Spotify but now I just use you because I've built a library that made it possible to be a di for the night at parties, but you suck now"
"Longtime premium user here - this is now a poorly designed app. Podcasts are always above all the music/playlists when you open the app, REQUIRING scrolling before seeing any music on a horizontal screen. Offline mode only works occasionally. Playlists often don't synchronize between devices. Recommendations are too sensitive when a family member listens music you don't like (who doesn't want more Baby Shark?). Private session is inconveniently located in the disorganized menu when needed."
March 2022. Still no voice search in UK. I wouldn't mind not having the Spotify microphone button but for some reason Spotify have deemed it a good idea to actually remove the voice type (mic icon) from my Samsung keyboard where it normally resides. The microphone button there is greyed out and therefore I have no means of doing a voice search in the app. Even ones that are within the operating system. This makes no sense. This is very dangerous when trying to search for a tune when driving .
"Amazing UI, stunning audio quality. Also more Arabic content is a must 🙏🏼. Damn spotify added lyrics, I'm in love 😍❤. Edit: last few updates broke spotify, broken player controls, can't control through the watch or other bluetooth devices, please fix it!!!!"
Using in landscape format messes up the formatting. The rewind and shuffle button get squashed together
"Where did the personally downloaded features go? I've noticed it for a while, but thought they might be shifting something around. I cannot access just my downloaded library by artist or album anymore, any link to the particular artist just takes me to the artists home page, which is all their music, not just the stuff I have saved. It used to be an option and I'd love for you to add it back. Should be the bottom right button "" your library"" which you'd think would be there already..."
"I love the music selection, but building a play list is so freaking annoying. I go to search and artist to add songs to it, as soon as I click the first song it takes me to a long list of suggestions that are nothing like what I searched for. I just want to add what I searched, I'll look at the suggestions later. I very much wish Spotify would fix this. I demoted it a star because building a play list is just impossible on this thing."
"The new app design is awful, buttons are way bigger than they need to be and quickly fill up the screen. They also added new restraints for non-premium users: you can only skip a few songs an hour and are forced to shuffle play through playlists instead of picking the song you actually want. Please bring back the spotify we all know and love"
"A lot of cool features. But oh, how I hate their podcast feature. Their experience is overall bad. Way worse than Pocket Casts, and I can't listen to podcasts how I want to (especially quickly making and editing lists). But they keep pushing it ( you can't turn it off) in a way that podcasts take away from the core experience of listening and discovering music."
Used to be a solid 5. This new update ruined my experience! I no longer can control or skip a track. The player interface is gone. Major deal breaker for me.
"Keeps crashing! I absolutely love spotify, I'm a premium user, but the crashesssss!!! Keeps either stopping music randomly (more frequently in this week), more often than not these days the play, etc buttons just aren't available which is extremely annoying, particularly if you want to take off shuffle mode 🙄 Minus regular bugs, it's a great app."
"Overall a good app. But for the love of god bring back the sound samples for when adding new songs to playlists. The one for the "" add song "" button. They made discovering new artists and songs soooo much easier. Plus making playlists war far more fun with it and definitely spiced up the experience."
the start is beautiful there were no annoying ads and i cand play back or see the play button.but after few weeks the play button started disappearing and there were many annoying ads everywhere and i cant play the music want to. pls fix this problem
"Can't figure out how to get it to play to my car speakers even though bluetooth is connected to my car stereo, but one button at the top of my screen to enable push notifications for ads sooo you can see where the developers heads are at."
"Not okay, I'm in Luxembourg and the Lidl add is ridiculously loud compared to the rest of the audio. Everytime it comes I have to remove my earphones or change the volume immediately because I might end up deaf. It's incredibly annoying, it should be fixed"
"Great music selection. However recently the app keeps cutting out/UI freezing. Sort it out Spotify, were paying customers. Seems to get worse each update. Maybe Google music is the way forward. Taking an additional star off for sneaking in ads on a premium service."
"Needs to better support Android 12 (S) OS update. Unbelievably slow now when opening the app. Definitely feels worse and more laggy then in the past. The app could also use a bit of a re-fresh design (nicer, smoother transitions, a new ""now playing"" Ul page). App UI is really starting to feel stale and static. Spotify for Android, could sure use some TLC. Needs to be brought back to live. Feels lost."
The app is good for the most part but its annoying when it requires you to be online or have internet connection even when playing a playlist that you already downloaded. Sometimes I'm in places that doesn't have mobile signal and it's annoying. It completly ruins the experience when driving.
I am a longtime user on Spotify and I am rlly despaponted in it right now because after a few months actually a year this random shuffle starts and I don't want to pay for premium right now so not sorry but it randomly shuffles it when I don't press the shuffle button I hope and the repeat button is gone I hope u can fix that for free accounts-._-. Bc I am not paying for premium
Bro fix the goddamn bug. I cant listen to the song preview and the play button isnt there its literally broken
"Lost of small bugs and glitches, the app is almost useless to use without premium and some features are hard to use. Even with premium it's quite bad. When I started using the app years ago I would've gave it a 4 - 5 star rating as you could use the free version of the app much more freely, there weren't many bugs and the app was overall just better."
Took me a while to switch to Spotify but was pleased when I did. Felt seamless and easy to use. I use a Google Pixel 3. Worked in the car with Waze. Now something weird is happening. No player controls now which is very irritating. Playback stops randomly. Doesn't respond to play button. What's going on Spotify??
"There are some significant usability issues with the latest update including sudden crashes, occasional inability to search and navigate to playlists, Bluetooth connectivity issues and issues with showing song/podcast details when playing (my device also doesn't acknowledge that a anything is playing in my notifications). Regular daily use of Spotify has been quite inconvenient and frustrating to use. Please provide fixes and a new update."
I have two stars because when i quit the app with songs the songs stop and when i am replay the song again it stops so fix it before 2 week or else you will 0 or 1 star
When I try to play a song it dosnt work and when I press the play button it plays another song
"Worked fine for about a month then it wouldn't pause when I pressed my Bluetooth pause/play button. There was no pause just play in the app. Had to close the app to get it to stop playing. Reinstalled then downloaded my music again, worked for 2 days then same pause/play issue plus it stopped playing after about 30 mins. Went back to Podbean for podcasts. I'm not fighting an app to get it to work when there are apps that do."
"Doesn't have nearly as many features as the home/web player. Please add those, I want to be able to sort through my songs from date added. Please fix some of the design layout issues as well. Also, I'm wondering why I'm not able to download my liked songs or select more than one to add to a playlist?"
"Long time user and overall great app but lastest update ruined it since it continues to crash, can't get though a song without having to restart the app."
"I really like Spotify for their great coverage of music of all genres, but the app is quite annoying. The UI becomes almost unusable if you are on a unstable internet connection (even if you want to listen to downloaded music), there are frequent changes to the UI which tend to break things (I can't participate in group sessions since their redesign) and since a recent update the player crashes and I have to restart the app every time i want to use it."
"Easily the worst user experience for listening to music I've ever had, which is embarrassing for such a widely used platform. Limited skips, forcibly shuffled playlists, inserting unrelated songs into albums without warning. I can't fathom why this platform is so prevalent."
"I used to like the app but the update ruined it. Like now you can't loop the song, you can't pick the song, and if you wanna do all of that you need premium. So be if we could have the old features back it would be perfect."
Sound quality has deteriorated and the volume is suuuper quiet
"Despite being one of the largest music streaming platforms ever, i consistently deal with not being able to see the song im playing either in the app or through the drop down menu push notification on mobile. Being broke could mean losing all your downloaded music if you cant pay for a month, they just delete your playlists. Pay the artists and fix your UI spotify."
Update is buggy play button is sometimes not showing.
App is severely glitched on the Samsung S10+. The app will play music but not sense the fact that it is. It doesn't show me the current song playing. And I have no control on picking next song or clicking the shuffle button.
"I have used and paid for this app for years, I don't know what is wrong but pause button disappeared, music plays when I don't want it too and can't see what song is playing, I am canceling this app!"
Lately very glitchy ....no fun to use....stops playing music while I'm on my bike......no control panel visible.....it has already been a way better UX
Control buttons often disappear with no other way to pause the music than to reboot the phone. Problem present on two different Samsung phones in my family. Killing app does not help.
Recent bug with disappearing UI which needs app restart to get fixed makes Spotify really annoying to use.
"The pause button randomly disappears, as does the bar which allows you to toggle the shuffle play and repeat options off and it randomly cuts out. Android operating system is up to date. I've also had to do repeated soft shutdowns of my phone, (Frequently the only way to switch Spotify off), AND uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Nothing is fixing the problem. Guess I'll be returning to the free version."
"Been really buggy lately! I've been using Spotify for years and the last month or so it has been super buggy. It stops playing at random, won't show what's playing in the app, pauses at random and sometimes the controls built onto my buds don't work to play/pause."
"I've been paying for spotify premium for over a year now, and usually I'm pretty happy with the service, but since the last update, whenever I have my earphones in songs keep randomly pausing & skipping. There isn't even a skip button on my headphones, so this shouldn't even be happening. It is very frustrating as I can no longer go for a walk with my earphones in (which was the only reason I pay for premium) & the app has become practically unuseable. Is there no way I can fix this in settings?"
App going downhill recently. Too many bugs in S22 Ultra. Notification shade gone. When it's there the buttons don't work. Doesn't even show the right song. Will play music and need to be force closed... Now playing panel is gone from the bottom of the app when browsing music etc. No bueno...
"Recent update is buggy, music stops playing and the play button disappears."
"Update: on my 2018 review, I said that the free version was good and ads were not intrusive. NOT ANYMORE. Now they play 3-5 ads every 3-4 music, depends on what time you are listening. It ruins the mood, and even the radio is playing less ads. Sometimes I just turn it off and stick to the radio."
"The new update is a mess, shuts off, disappearing play button, disconnect from bluetooth headphones, it will play when you shutdown the app. You have restart phone to stop the playing, I am also using Samsung 22 ultra. Please fix these issues or I will go back to Amazon music for streaming."
"I love Spotify and have had a premium account for years. but the last update has quite some glitches. -Cannot always see the playback song. -music plays without -Music randomly stops (even downloaded songs so it cannot be an issue of network). -menu option doesn't respond or insists to go online when there's poor network (but then shouldn't it default to the offline menu version?) Please, please fix the bugs."
"Super buggy, crackles regularly, I'm not able to see the skip/play/pause button when playing 90% of the time, meaning I also can't alter the queue, switch between shuffle and repeat, but most annoyingly pause or skips songs at all, have to close the app to stop music playing, otherwise good selection of music"
"Issues with pause and skip buttons disappearing in the tool bar, constant having to restart the app. Not worth the price I'm paying, have cancelled for now until sorted."
"Somewhat a good app. It's a paid service so I expect premium service. I download podcasts for OFFLINE USE and the app is barely useable offline. All your downloaded podcasts can only be accessed while connected to the servers DESPITE BEING DOWNLOAD. ""Oh, just go into offline mode"" you might think. HORRIBLE IDEA! Offline mode is a suicide switch for this app. Switching to offline mode causes the app to delete a bunch of downloaded content. I pay for this stupid service."
I don't know what happened between now and last month. But here lately spotify has taken away my chance to control what I listen to. Meaning no play nor skip buttons seem to appear as they use to. It seems to go in car mode even when not in a car🤔 please fix this issue.
"Frustrating app. Seems to get worse on a semi-monthy basis. I've been using it for about 4 years + now. Great selection has kept me there but the app constantly having problems and ruining podcasts listening will likely move me towards another platform. Still, the best selection. But what's the point when the app can't play them. You'd think with all the money brought in and it being they're only real business that they would have a more seamless operation for actually listening."
"New update same problems. Plays ok via Bluetooth in the car but when disconnected continues to play on phone. Play bar disappears and notification bar shows play button, but app is still playing. Only way to stop playback is to close app."
"I downloaded this app 2 months ago and I really like this app and all but to be honest, i've been having some issues with playing the songs I liked. Whenever I try to press the ""play"" button, it only plays the chorus of my liked songs and then continues to play the suggested songs. It wasn't like this before I downloaded it, so I really hope this gets fixed or Idk if this is natural."
"Please fix your app ASAP! I am a premium user and lately this is not premium service. I can't control the music because the play bar goes away randomly. The app keeps playing when it should stop, or stops when it should be playing. It is so unreliable right now. I have done a clean install, contacted support, all but given up on the service. For a company this size who is gladly taking our monthly fees, I would think these bugs would be fixed much quicker. Please get with it, Spotify."
"I'm getting strange bugs where the preview bar of the currently playing audio disappears. The app randomly pauses podcasts even though I've given it unrestricted access to my battery. The UI is sometimes unresponsive, it feels like something is loading in the background before you can press buttons sometimes, but the problem with this is that the user isn't notified. I have removed the app from my phone and will install when it is updated."
"Limited skips, 4-8 ads every ad break, stuck on shuffle, always yelling at me to get premium but doesn't let me buy it because I'm in québec, and made my music 5 times quieter. But other then that it's great"
"Being a premium user for years I can say that most of time the app has been reliable and useful. But no more. It is changing and the user experience is quickly deteriorating. Some of the issues: 1) EACH time I start it up, it asks if it can use Bluetooth. No matter how many times I confirm it's OK, it will ask it over and over again 2) Currently playing song and/or playlist becomes unaccessible when clicking ""home"" / ""search"" or ""library"". Extremely annoying. 3) When listening music while you're not using the phone, it just stops randomly. Sometimes after a 30 seconds, sometimes after 2-3 minutes. Those issues are relatively new, I never experienced them in the past. Depending on the evolution I'm afraid I might need to decide to turn to another music service."
Now playing bar keeps disappearing. It's quite frustrating. Please fix it.
"I've uinstalled and reinstalled and each time after a few minutes of playing I lose the option to pause, rewind, and fast forward, both inside the app and on the lock screen. I'm on the latest version, so not sure what the issue is."
"Probably the worst software I pay for. Lots of broken functionality. Trying to listen offline leads to perpetual loading until an initial connection is made then while music plays, there's no album images. Action panel with play, pause etc buttons disappears every time I use the app and requires app restart to fix. Play shuffle doesn't work. App is bloated and slow to open. Home page is cluttered. Unable to remove Podcast notifications from a podcast I listened to once. Not OK for subscription."
So much crashes on MIUI 12.5.The app is good for listening to songs but please fix this bug.
"Started as a solid 5-star, turned into a broken mess. I can't like songs anymore, trying to look at artist discographies only results in an error message, listening to songs 'offline' requires turning off data entirely and then repeated restarting the app (oh on that note, I can't download songs anymore either nor save playlists) I'd appreciate any help, and yes I have repeatedly redownloaded and logged in/out. This only affects one device and I'm not willing to lose all my music"
"Very buggy lately. I've been subbed for a few years now and it's in the worst state I've experienced. Now playing bar disappears (requires restart), randomly stops music and starts again, keeps asking for bluetooth access eveytime you open the app. Thats just a few of the bugs. They also removed the in car view for no reason whatsoever and never replaced it with anything. I'm now at the point where checking out the competition is a viable prospect. Terrible decisions for a premium app."
"since 2 week ago, the queue is broken, sometimes Spotify shows that it's not playing any song while it actually is. When that happens I can't control Playback using my headphones media control buttons. Just. Really. Annoying."
"back button doesnt work sometimes (like it goes back to 0:00 but the audio itself wouldnt go back and would just continue playing). it also gets messed up when you queue (i.e sometimes the last song you queued is the first and the only one that would appear in the queue list, and you cant edit the queue because you cant see the other songs that are queued). not sure if its a problem with my phone, but please look into it!! the app is perfect otherwise :))"
"i love Spotify but omg please fix your app lol. whenever I open it recently (z fold 2 oneui4.1) it just completely freezes up, forcing me to restart the app at minimum two times before it works. super frustrating and makes me hate using this app on mobile lately."
New bug found where the UI for controlling the music which is playing doesn't appear making it impossible to change tracks or pause/play music.
Recently when I am playing a song it doesnt show what I am playing and the song controls are missing. Quite annoying
"Edit 04/2022: the app is crashing every 15min, stopping the songs suddenly, not displaying the music player anymore... Maybe you should fix your app for good before giving millions to FC Barcelona... I love Spotify but for a few weeks now it has some bugs and the shuffling is pretty bad, I often get 2 times the same song within 2 hours of listening a playlist with 800 songs... Please fix that it was fine before and it's quite annoying now"
"I've been a Spotify user for the best part of a decade but bugs are starting to ruin my experience. The worst one is every single night whilst I'm asleep Spotify starts playing without prompt whenever it wants, I've taken to just turning my volume all he way down but still I wake up every day and it's been playing all night. Also often times it will stop showing the now playing bar as if nothing is on whilst it is and changes the song whenever it likes which is really irritating whilst driving."
"Use this app for quite a few years both as a free account and on premium. Can't say I have noticed any improvement on the premium side and the free side just gets worse. A ridiculous amount of ads, forces songs onto your playlist whether they're hidden or not, forces you to be online even if you've downloaded podcasts. It's ok if on premium, if it's the free version it's just the worst"
"Used to be great but so many bugs at the moment. If the screen locks the track pauses and you have to unlock to carry on. You can't always press the green play button on a playlist or album, you have to go back out and press the smaller play button. Little irritating things that make it not worth subscribing anymore."
"I experienced a lot of bugs within the app, mainly switching off abruptly, not being able to play/ start or showing errors while operating. Desktop version had been uninstalled nearly immediately as it affected how my computer operated with all the errors displayed. Mobile version is a tad better, but still not providing a good user experience in my opinion."
"Is it just me or the music oftenly stops playing when I connect it to bluetooth speakers? Also, where the pause, previous, and next button in swipe down went to? I am pretty sure it was there."
"The app steals focus and immediately starts playing as soon as you open the app. Did I want to just put a song I heard elsewhere into a playlist, while continuing to listen aduio from something else? Too bad! Also, they broke the They Might Be Giants album Apollo 18. That's more of a service issue, but given aggressively unresponsive they are to fixing the issue, I don't feel bad docking them points"
App used to work great! I use this app daily at work. Lately it will not give the buttons to control your music while listening. Major pain when I need to pause it for work.
"The latest version is extremely buggy. Music stops for no reason, sometimes lose the play/pause buttons while music is playing and you have to exit the app and restart it. Looking forward to the next update which will Hopefully fix the bugs"
"15 Apr 2022 update: the buttons disappear so you start playing something then it becomes impossible to pause, like or skip tracks without restarting the app. Something is obviously broken in a recent update. Spotify has been so buggy for most of the time I've had it. When I get time I'll seriously look at cancelling premium and switching to a competitor."
"The app has become increasingly less stable since the last update and they consistently make random, unnecessary changes to the layout of the mobile app at least every other month. Change for the sake of change is annoying, it's not an improvement just because you move a button."
"Enabling local files doesn't work (guessing I have too many to import) Recent issue: Spotify sometimes stalls and crashes on application open. Recent issue: Media controls are sometimes gone (no currently playing song bar within the app, notifcation controls show nothing but a disabled play button) and I have to end the app process to stop the music."
"Used since December 2021. Music selection is decent, but. UI is convoluted. Functionality buggy and worsening. Latest update adds frequent breaks in the music (app not crashed, but music stops with no way to resume). Song info reported to Android 12 for music controls often wrong, now even when not casting. Constantly nags about denied permissions. Works better exempted from battery optimizer, but eats battery at alarming rate. No longer pauses when BT or headphones removed. ""The best"", but bad."
Latest update broke some ui elements on Samsung devices particularly around the player doesn't show or if it does its wrong.
"Keep losing the playing now tab on the button, have to close app and restart. Songs will cut out for a second then resume, sometimes won't connect with Android auto. These are new issues. These need to be fixed quickly. I'm not paying for a broken app...."
"Have had spotify for years and now all of the sudden it's constantly glitching and I'm always having to close it just to have the play bar show up, let alone the fact that it consistently requires me to do this every hour. You need to figure out the bug that is stopping spotify from working if you want to keep your patrons because I'm getting sick of paying $17 for something that rarely works, thank you."
"Since the last update the playback controls panel will randomly disappear and it won't come back until you've force closed and relaunched the app. It does this almost every time I use it. The shuffle play button is also now smaller than it used to be but the space hasn't been used for anything else, so we're left with a button that is more difficult to press for no reason. Please stop doing stuff like this!"
"cannot go back, always stucks on loading screen, not fixed for a quite long time. Now music stops suddenly and it is not possible to go to the now playing screen"
"Leave it alone. Everytime you update it, it quits working. I pay for premium but after this latest update I cannot get anything to load. Fix it or when it's time to renew for my year in May, I ""may"" have to find a new streaming platform!"
"Was 5 stars until this week but now it's becoming unusable. For some reason the control bar keeps disappearing so I have to force quit to pause, change track etc. Also, podcasts are stopping periodically. Fix the bugs, spotify. Thank you."
Bring back the music bar so i can change songs or play/pause. It's been glitchy lately where it will stop randomly or just quit by itself. Go back to the previous update. Otherwise would be 5 ☆
"It is very glitchy lately, the play/ pause button on the bottom of my screen disappears, and I have to close the app to pause music. Also, does not show on my lock screen anymore."
The update completely broke this app. I have to force quit the app every time I try and listen in my car. The now playing bar won't pop up unless I force quit. Get this fixed... this is going g on for to long. I love Spotify but if they can't fix their app soon I may be looking else where for my streaming needs
"Is a good music subscription, but app seems to not boot at all on my Poco F3 with the new MIUI 13 (Android 12)"
Rarely had problems before last update. Now music controls randomly disappear when connected to car bluetooth and at other times. Often requires app restart to stop playback and regain control.
There is some bug in android where the play/pause button just isn't visible
Can you please fix the last releases bugs app is almost unusable in its current state Keeps jumping tracks or stopping playing Losing play button in the app so have to close it down and reload
"Not sure if this is only for my phone model but it keeps just.... closing down. I'll be playing something and then it goes quiet and when I look it's not even open. Sometimes it's within one song and others it can be an hour. It also keeps losing the play panel at the bottom so I can't stop, skip or change the random/replay options etc. Please fix because I'm not paying for faff."
"If I pick a song from a Single, it replays that song forever. I would prefer it play the song once then start radio for that song. If I have a que, and I click a song, I would like that song to play, then continue playing the items that are in the que. Instead, right now if I have a que then click a song it behaves the same as if I pressed the Next button and plays the next song in the que. It completely ignores the fact that I clicked a song that I would like to listen to."
"You've stuffed the user experience. The ""now playing"" page is difficult to find, as is the ""Play to external device"" feature, and when in landscape mode, it says nothing is playing when it is actually playing music."
"What have you done to this app? Lately it's been slow, buggy and crashes frequently. My main gripe at the moment has songs and podcasts playing without bringing up any kind of control panel, so I can't pause, play or skip tracks, or access the play queue. Currently listening to a podcast and the only means I have to stop it is to close the app. Please fix, it's a right nuisance."
"Now Playing keeps disappearing and playlists/albums cut off after ~15 mins of playtime, requiring a restart of the song. Absolutely horrible push-update, my dudes. Disappointing to go from a great app to absolute garbage tha hasn't been fixed over 24hrs. You're better than this.... Or maybe not?"
"Since the last update the app has been playing up, I can't pause the songs or stop them, if my phone rings when I'm listening to music then it keeps playing the music during the call, and I can't stop it without turning my whole phone off. Please fix it quickly otherwise I'm going to unsubscribe."
The new update is still a bit buggy and the design is horrible
"Has been crashing recently. Doesn't display what song is playing and after playing a few songs, the app crashes. Needs to constantly exit/quit the app and enter it again for jt to worm properly"
"I love the app, but it's VERY slow loading playlists or albums on 4G, even on high end phones. PLUS, the ability to quickly remove songs from your playlist while on the ""album art view"" is still missing. Since you have to exit that view and search the playlist from the beginning to find the song. The android app also DESPERATELY needs the iOS feature to swipe and quickly add songs to your queue"
Have been a Spotify premium user for quite sometime. But recently the app keeps crashing.. music suddenly stops and I'm unable to find the currently playing button on my app. Please fix it ASAP!! Else gotta try out YouTube premium
"This App is currently in a bad place. There's currently a few very obvious bugs that make navigating songs quite challenging. Really surprised this passed testing and surprised it's gone so long without fixes. Free websites and apps have better quality assurance, this is a luxury MONTHLY subscription..."
UI is now uncomfortable to navigate through. The play menu sometimes doesn't even show up anymore. Using shortcuts and voice command sometimes don't even work.
"Last week or so the app just stops playing. Even when open and playing it doesnt show me 'now playing', so i know it's gonna stop/close/mess up as soon as i minimise spotify. Always has annoying little 'quirks', but this is frustrating because i have to keep stipping what I'm doing to fix it and it gets me out of my mood/stops my flow."
Big issue. When loading music it won't let me pause. The pause and play button will disappear. Along with the shuffle and skip options. I have to restart my device to get the app to work again. It's very frustrating
"Used to love it but its so glitchy now. There's no play button, I can't pause it either, have to turn my phone on and off to make it stop playing.. nightmare. Considering changing to tidal at this rate"
"Music selection is good, app is shocking. So many bugs. Podcasts stopping for no reason, mini player in notification panel disappearing, play / pause button and up next selection disappearing."
Not sure what the issue is but can't pause or stop a podcast or tune at the moment. It's playing but only has the play button to press so I'm having to either uninstall the app or restart my phone to stop it! Started happening a few days ago. Thought an update and reinstall would work but hasn't fixed the issue. It also spa playing for absolutely no reason. No way of contacting Spotify of course
"Used to be a 5/5 but barely works anymore. Keeps crashing, the play/pause button never shows up so you can't stop your music or skip a song,"
"Autoplays random song when locking screen, randomly starts a radio when i select a playlist When connecting to my car's bluetooth I can't select the currently playing song, app requires full restart. Play bar is not appearing"
Super buggy. Quits unexpectedly and doesn't show a play bar. They gotta figure this out.
"Spotify is great but the android application is horrible, many bugs. No need to describe, the user experience is very bad. . Spotify please improve."
The worst update ever. It's a music app without a playback control. You need to close the app and restart it to access the playback control UI.
Most of the time you loses control to do anything in the app the controls what songs you want to play next. Also connectivity to the audio output( Bluetooth and aux) sometime it will just stop playing song with no explanation. This is the worse I've ever experienced with spotify.
"Considering I have to pay extortionate prices a month to use this app, one would at expect it to, at the very least, work. It's become so buggy and frustrating to use, the banner in the notification centre doesn't work 9/10 times, and the app refuses to load my playlists even after restarting both app and phone many times, sometimes it wont play and other times it'll play a song but won't even realise it's playing and won't let you pause it, so you HAVE to restart. Awful UX."
Spotify isn't working well since the last update. It either starts playing music totally random or it stops playing and only continues after i pushed the power button of my phone... i allready uninstalled it and got it back but its still not working properly
New update has brained it. Stops playing music all of a sudden. No reason. Also the track change / pause option disappears so you have no way of stopping music unless you quit the app.
The buttons for play/pause and forward/backward disappear sometimes. There is no way to pause except for using Android to stop the app. It has been this way for several days now.
"Spotify has been a 5 for me in both the free and the premium version. However, the most recent update affected UI. I have to close the app, or uninstall and reinstall it so that I can see the music selection tab. The update makes this tab dissappear on the mobile version. Also, from my country I liked it when I had access to the voice option as I use Spotify the most when I am driving, and the voice option optimized my searches and music selection while driving. I'll update my rate when fixed."
"Kind of OK but lots of bugs. Eg when you start playing a podcast you'll get a little control bar showing what you're playing with play/pause and skip forward / backwards buttons. However this soon disappears (maybe after the screen has been off for a little while?) leaving you with no way of controlling the playback, other than force closing the app and restarting it. Guess there's a fair amount of content on Spotify, so deserves at least 2 stars."
The media player isn't working. The skip and pause button don't appear
"I use Spotify every day but recently the app is frustrating. When listening, very often the app the UI doesn't show any music is playing so I have no way to pause, play or change song via the phone (android). There isn't even a bar on the lock screen. The shuffle functionality quite simple doesn't work as it should. When I shuffle my songs I get the same songs played to me, but also repeated. Maybe they're trying to be too smart and playing songs they know you like. Let me make that decision"
"What is going on with Spotify?? Two, three tracks into a playlist and it stops. Start it again and the same thing happens over and over. Get it fixed quick or I'll be switching to Deezer."
"Bugs, bugs and bugs. Play bar disappears 10x a day. Unable to play downloaded music when offline. Horrible UX. Hey, Spotify, is it really so hard to make something thst works?"
"What is wrong with Spotify nowadays? It just stop playing music and the pause button disappears :/ i reinstalled the app seven times and restarted my phone, but unfortunatelly nothing changed."
Spotify keeps stopping and when i open the app the now playing bar is no longer there. Checked playstore and no update required. vas happenin
"This has been great for years, I've loved having a premium account, the amount I use it, it's worth it. Now however, it won't show me the bar at the bottom with the play/pause, skip buttons and I have tried uninstalling, reinstalling, logging out and logging back in again and nothing has fixed it. Due to this I am unable to control my music with my earbuds or anything and queuing music doesn't work anymore. Please try to fix this bug!"
"Lots of content, but the app also has lots of bugs. At times it keeps playing in the background and the app cant be paused it just keeps playing until you close the app in the OS. Play/pause button disappears at least once a day also forcing close with OS is the only fix. Offline mode somehow still needs a data connection to launch the app... Also, downloaded content should be accessible from home screen direct and more prominent/visible."
"Keeps starting by itself, but when I want to liaten to music the app takes long to start up, I have a galaxy S8plus it quick with any other app but this one, thinking of changing to another app"
"I don't what is going on, the past couple of days it's been bugging out. Songs will skip, pause, not play. The play or pause button will be stuck."
The latest UI is garbage. Nice having no ability to stop music or general play controls. Form over function. Update so now the controls have magically appeared again
"So many glitches the past month that it's just ruining listening to music for me. Paying for premium when half the time there's no play button, it doesn't show me what song I'm listening to even while on the app, won't let me skip songs because of this or click pause or carry on a song. Constantly getting useless and annoying notifications about connecting to random people also listening to Spotify but won't give me an accurate notification of what song I'm listening to so that too doesn't work"
"Whatever you updated in the most recent version makes Spotify unusable. I can't control playback from the Spotify UI or my bluetooth device. I cannot change the song as the ""Now Playing"" is no longer showing up. Makes streaming experience less than optimal."
"Latest update consistently fails to display the ""now playing"" section of the UI, both within the app and in the Android shade"
Something is going on with the app. The play button keeps disappearing forcing me to hard reset the app in order to skip or pause a song. The queue keeps erasing songs or not allowing me to click on it to change the order/see what I have queued.
"Super glitchy. It would play w/o warning and restart everytime I would leave my car but wouldn't play when I was IN my car and wanted it to! No buttons to play, pause, or change track. Just wow"
It's very buggy and has to be repeatedly restarted regularly to fix problems with the UI. The playlist feature seems intentionally designed to make it difficult to put songs onto multiple playlists. It's sluggish and the algorithm is often incoherent with anything but obvious genre.
"The app itself is decent. I am experiencing quite a bit of bugs from the new update that make this app very difficult. When I play a song or podcast, I can't see the control panel. So my next option would be to go to my notifications to see the controls, but it isn't there either. When playing a song, the only way I can pause it, is to close the Spotify app completely. This makes for a really frustrating experience. I have seen other reviews stating the same, so I hope this can be fixed."
Since update I have no play/pause buttons and stops randomly or play playlist si have not made. Like other reviewers have said the only way is totally stop app and start again. I've cleared cache a million times a d rebootrd m phone etc un/rei stalled 3 to 4 3 to no avail. I hope this is quickly fixed.
"just updated to the newest version. It is unstable. Song stopped abruptly, suddenly. Sometimes Play/pause button don't show up. Can I revert back?"
"I'm not sure if this is from a recent update or what, but now, whenever I leave my car, the music will continue playing on my phone and ALL CONTROLS have disappeared. They disappear from the whole app when it is launched, disappeared from my lock screen preview, and disappeared from the top drop-down menu. This is incredibly frustrating as it now requires me opening the app settings in Android and doing a 'force stop'. Galaxy A71 on Android 11."
"new update sucks. removed the ability to pause music and see what is being played seemingly randomly, new ui isn't as good as it used to be."
"Pretty decent app, great way to find new artists/songs that suit your taste, but as a free user now having to listen to 2 ads in a row on top of all the other missing perks, I'm considering deleting Spotify."
"I used to like Spotify quite a lot, and even paid for premium when I was often in spotty reception areas. Currently I'm using the free version - which was okay when it was a couple of ads every half hour. Now it's more like TV - 2-3 ads every 2 or 3 songs. They cut in part way through songs too and the last half hour has been so irritating that although I could be free by subscribing again I don't want to reward the changes they've made by doing this. Big thumbs down guys, I might just uninstall"
I love the variety of music and podcasts on here but this app on my android continually force closes without warning. Half the time the music bar with the play button doesnt appear and I can see / control what is playing beyond shuffle and I pay for premium. Very frustrating.
Since the update my podcasts will just randomly pause. It's a pain to have to go into the app and try to get it playing again. Also the pause button has disappeared on several.
The newest update hasn't helped. Huge amount of glitches since then. Stops playing and won't play when press it again. Quick scroll is gone and a lot of time the now playing down the bottom doesn't come up at all
Last update on premium version just ruined the experience-terrible. Player keep disappearing and In order to see it again need to restart the app and it's keep happening constantly 🙄 Also some other features disappeared like lyrics etc... well what an update...
"I've been using spotify for a couple of years now but recently the app shows ""no internet connection"" and I can't listen to my songs if I'm not connected to wifi. I definitely have data plans and I can access apps and youtube that requires internet but for some reason spotify does not work when I am only using data on my phone."
This app used to be great for listening to music but now you are unable to listen to the song you want. It plays whatever it wants when you click on your playlist and you can't pick yourself. I believe this is only on the android app though. Quite disappointed.
I have been a user of Spotify for nearly 10 years and have always sung it's praises but over the last couple of months the app has completely downgraded. It cannot play a playlist without bugging. It will end mid song. It needs to be fixed. It is quite something when an app that has worked perfectly for years can now no longer perform its sole function: to play music.
"Great app, access to music and constant playlists is amazing. However since the last update my music will just stop playing and I can't return where I left off as the play and pause buttons disappear. Not that happy about that, hopefully the small bug gets fixed soon otherwise I'll have to cancel my premium and move to another service"
"Disappointing I am a paying user of this app. Install I could see information on the screen which was great as a screen saver because facts about songs and singers were quite interesting and a good talking point when listening to music with friends. This feature is no longer. I talked to them (online chat - no phone) and the attendant could not be any useless. The new issue now is that once spotify is on, I can't switch it off. I have been restarting my phone to be able to do so."
"Still gets ads for podcasts and for albums that i really dont care for (yes, i got premium. I even got a familyplan). It also nags me about how bluetooth is improved with Android 12 (I use AUX headphones.). My downloaded music disappears at times, so i have to download my whole library EVERY single day. Getting really close to just dumping Spotify."
"Design is great. Catalogue is great. App usability is very frustrating. Podcasts and songs ""ghost playing"". It's playing but spotify doesn't show anything playing. Podcast video is non existent and barely functional after years of development promises. Full screen options are limited if you like having your 'currently playing' on display"
"After the last update the app has been really buggy, it often won't register when I go back on a song and it just keeps on playing no matter how many times I hit the rewind button, it also often won't show what song is playing in the bottom of the screen, the only way to fiz it is to close the app and open it again. Pretty annoying."
Not a fan at all. Why can I no longer use the 15 seconds forward button on podcasts
"Most recent update has ruined the app. When I play a song, the progress bar doesn't show so no control over songs, music stops randomly now and the shuffle algorithm is terrible, always adds the same songs you've listened to at the top of the list. It's honestly deterring me from continuing to use Spotify."
"Wanted to listen to 1 song. Watched an add. Finished song and moved to random song Wanted to listen to same song again. Pressed song again, still random song. Closed app. Opened, watched another advert. Pressed song I wanted, still random song. Created play list with only the song i want in it, still random song. Keeps playing ads. Day ruined. I could just be dumb tho."
"I really love spotify but there is a problem. I press the song that I want, then i press a button that is suposed to put the song a bit more forward. But apparently it changes the song. And then I try to go back and it does not work. So from now on I cant even play my song because it puts an other one when I'm pressing the one I want."
"Spotify free is quite scummy honestly. A playlist is pretty much the same as daily mix at th is point. They play a few songs from the playlist then start going down a rabbit hole of associated radios, and it's really annoying after some time. Or when they finally finish giving you all the songs from the playlist, they just change lanes, and you don't hear another one of your preferred songs until you reset the app and click the playlist again. ""and more"" doesn't work which just really sucks."
I have had Spotify for years but after the last update things have gotten bad. My podcast will just stop for no reason. Also they are a pain to find your current episode then you are over 100 episodes into something. Why not make a bookmark. I am getting very frustrated because I have ADHD and listening to podcasts helps me to stay on task with household chores or just simply keep myself moving. It becomes a nuisance when I have to keep searching for the episode to press play on.
Annoying popup asking for Bluetooth permissions appears EVERY TIME I open Spotify. This is a horrible user experience.
"After few updates... Bug with song in line wasn't fixed. When open album with songs they're in few lines(Text lines) , and you can't choose a song what you want to listen. Only what I can do it's push play button with a random song(in album) , and I've had a feeling what's literally plays random from author (from Others album's too). Probably it's just a feeling, but still... It's a good program for listening music(when bug doesn't appeared)....... (눈‸눈)"
Recently Uninstalled it because I had trouble canceling my premium. I could not find how to do it. Plus after I finally got the option to cancel (after they tried for months to get a payment) I could not take it off of offline mode. The button was no longer there and also I could no longer listen to songs due to being stuck in offline mode. I miss the old Spotify where I could listen to music but now it plays music randomly unless you have premium which I cannot afford.
"I've had a great experience with spotify for past few months but the new library update and how only premium users can turn shuffle off sucks it ruined my whole experience, its literally so bad, if yall get rid of that I'll start using spotify again but for now just no."
"Been a premium user for 6 years now. Love it, use it all the time (phone), but with lastest 2 updates it's become VERY annoying! I listen to ""favorites"" alphabetically as shuffle repeats too often for me. The late Mar update caused the song list in my favorites to reset to top frequently & removed tab you pull down to scroll quickly down list. 2nd recent update fixed that but now it resets my list EVERYTIME! Doesn't matter if running in background or screen just timed out. ANNOYING please fix!!"
So i donwnloaded spotify on my car android head unit and became premuim just so i can listen to music without needing wifi everytime i want music and after donwloading the musics its okay but it stucks and wont play music until it goes online and this happens like everyday! I think it only needed to go online every 30days to check for membership
"This is a review after giving the app another try on a new phone again and almost nothing has changed, I got spotify because I wanted a free music platform. I don't want a music app which limits the amount of skips. The spotify suggested which I havent found a way to remove. The apps intuitive ai is nice and I like the look and how almost every song you could imagine is there, but the songs you don't like flood them. Not to mention if you want to listen to a song again it has an add every time;("
Far far too quiet. Can barely hear music or podcasts using Bluetooth headphones.
The best part is that the equilizer. It is so cool. But the thing pulls me back from giving 5 stars is TOO MANY ADS. One can't even listen to their favorite song online without getting interrupted by an add. I was listening 'believer' and as soon as the chorus started the fricking add popped up. I should not say but i downloaded Hungama. Now i think i don't need Spotify unless Spotify removes the ads
"The songs are nice, but the UI is an abomination. You can't play specific songs. If you search for a song it shows you the song but it'll take you to a playlist that is shuffled. You need premium to choose a specific song. No wonder they're losing to apple music."
Spotify connect is just a miserable experience that ruins my weekend mornings
Love the interface and the UI but can't play a particular song if I wanted to I need to listen to the whole playlist just to get there. Using yt music until you guys fix that
"Stops playing music randomly, UI breaks often, and ""Randomize"" only plays 20 song loops in my 300 song playlist."
Ads and ads they kind of mentally forcing to buy premium and also I am a k pop fan so I listen to korean songs so there is a song called mafia in the morning by itzy (which has a english version) so whenever I am clicking on the Korean version it is playing the English version instead I have tried many times from the search button as well as from my playlist but it is not working please fix this issue and also please reduce ads in the free version
"This app is getting increasingly frustrating to use. Not only from the weird user experience rework where you navigate using tags, but also bugs or features or whatever, where nothing works as long as you are downloading tracks, or where songs you have downloaded will be greyed out when offline for no apparent reason like others have mentioned. Strongly considering cancelling my subscription after more than 10 years"
Extremely poor ux design. Can't find my account details.
It locked me out of my other account. The worst part is that it requires you to login to contact them for support. Who the heck thought that was a good idea? I'm paying these people and they won't let me login! I'm reducing my rating by 1 star because they added misinformation disclaimers to their podcasts.
Initially I loved spotify so much. So muvh music. The podcasts plus its just intuitive to use. Except I cant log in now.. My subscription is eating away. I get a *you are currently set to offline* am appalled at this issue.. If you dont fix it I will migrate to something else and will stop recommending it to all my friends
"I'm sure if I was a teenager I'd be able to load and use this perfectly. I'm not, and don't have access to one, so I have it on my mobile and actually paid for it, but will probably quit paying soon as I'm not able to use it properly. Don't even know how to get it on my desktop, or whether it's even possible. And hey, Spotify, you want MY money, so don't tell me I should search through the dross on YouTube."
"I've been a user of Spotify for over three years, damn near all the music you need.. UI layout could be a little easier and lasty the prices are rising and getting too Damn high.. stop being so greedy!"
"This app is great, except when I get 4 ads, CONSECUTIVE, for music that I hate. Spotify, quit recommending me god awful works of ""art"" that is pop and rap music."
"The fact that we can't disable shuffle on mobile without premium is enough for me to say do not download this app for your phone. On a PC or console, Maybe but on mobile it is not reccomend as half the features are blocked behind pay walls. And not to mention spotify will add random songs to a playlist and its possible that you don't like the song and will irritated rather quickly."
"The app is TRASH. Playbar disappearing, suddenly stops playing tracks, buttons not responding. So sad that they have the best content in the industry. Would be gone long ago if that wouldn't be the case. @Spotify get your app game under control!"
Up until now we've found Spotify great. But then useless adverts appeared while listening to podcasts. This is a bad idea!!! We are already paying 13 euros a month. For ads?! Such a shame. Thinking of quitting.
"I speak English, and only English. Stop giving me ads from ""jack in the box"" because I don't know whats he's saying. And I'm getting the ad after every song I play. And I'm genuinely thinking of moving to a different music app like pandora. I'm not paying for premium because I could play pandora for free with less ads. Like right now, while listening to spotify I just got 4, 30 seconds ads. That's 2 minutes of ads for 1 song. Nice"
"Worked perfect for years, but now a very buggy app. If i go to press a song to play, it will. But then it wont take me to the next page where i can rewind, pause/play or fwd to next song. Furthermore, the bottom bar that usually pops up if you have something playing isnt there either so theres no way to do any of the above. In order for your music to stop playing you need to end the app completely. This has been an issue for quite sometime now a d v frustrating. App up to date, Samsung S21+.FBW"
"Green 'Play' button is constantly breaking, preventing me from playing podcasts. This frequently requires me to reinstall the app. I'm unwilling to pay for an app which functions poorly"
"Great in theory and design. Lacks in functionality, buggy."
"I love Spotify and love using it, however, the app can be confusion and diffucult to use. There arent any guides in the app for how to work it either. It can be frustrating trying to listen to a song and its an different song from the one you searched all together."
Ok so where did the shuffle button go? Second I click on a song in my list it plays something else. I play a list I have it plays songs not even in my list. Lets get this fixed or revert back to the previous version that worked properly
I used Spotify premium for years and I used to love it. Now not so much. Overly complicated. I downgraded to the free version but it doesn't let me play albums (unless it's set up wrongly). Random tracks are put in playlists and then I can't quickly jump through them. Or you get a few seconds of the track. Spotify app on Android tablet is fine so far (a older version of the app I think) but on my android phone it's pants! Auto update a couple of days ago. Will premium need the same?
Randomly stops music all the time as if it is buffering or something (play button shiws its playing but the song progress bar is just stuck) while im only listening to offline playlists. Damn thing keeps happening on the pc version as well. Absolutely frustrating and makes me wonder why keep paying for such a pathetic service in the first place
"2022 and the UI is still bad. If it wasn't for music, I wouldn't use this."
"I like how you can listen to music, but now you have to press 'the shuffle button' to listen to music. What if I wanna hear one specific song, and I have to press shuffle and only get to use 6 skips an hour? I just don't like this update. Great job with past updates though 👏🏻."
I would give a five star but they need to make it was when the shuffle and repeat button were on the board thing and you tap or click the music on you playlist it would take you to the actual song and play it
"For some reason my pause button along woth lyrics has disappeared. Also, the music stops in the middle of playing multiple times on each song. I have to hit play on my earbuds. I have uninstalled multiple times and nothing is helping"
"I love spotify but they NEED to fix this garbage update. I was playing music on my laptop and pulled out my phone to switch AND THERE IS NO WHERE FOR ME TO PLAY MUSIC ON MY PHONE. no play button, NOTHING. I'm so pissed I can't even play my music why spotfy whyyyyyy."
I hate this new update for the sole reason that I can't use the scrollbars anymore. I have over 3000 downloaded songs and have to spend ages scrolling down manually to get to the song i feel like listening. And the search bar in the liked songs is not as good as before. Very disappointed in the new update... Wish I could unupdate it and use the older version Also the shuffle button plays the same songs all the time :///
"My experience with Spotify has been generally horrible. I often listen to music on my Chromecast, but no matter what I do, Spotify will get stuck on connecting and never play whenever I tried to cast. This is a common, Spotify-side issue that's been plaguing the app for years and NEVER gets solved. When I manage to connect, sometimes Spotify will randomly disconnect and play on my phone. This is ridiculous. Not to mention the terrible Galaxy Watch support that never goes anywhere."
"Used this service for a while, tried both free and premium. Free is outright non-usable and shouldn't exist because of its ᵈᶦʳᵗʸ ""you have to pay to not suffer"" concept. Premium is alright, there're basic functions any built-in player has but song suggestions often aren't accurate (seem based on shared language for non-english songs). I've lost access to my account at 8th march (paid on feb 28) and still can't log in. Mourning my lost playlists but not regretting switching to a better service."
"I love it but why do music stop after few seconds of playing,?i keep tapping the play button which is boring and i can't enjoy my music"
"The built in short free premium trial was honestly great. The moment I was booted to free account status it was horrendous just trying to play certain songs. I can live with the ads, but Forced shuffle, limited skips, the inability to go back to a specific song to play it from a playlist or even just searching it after youve already played it...I get that money needs to be made, but I'd literally rather listen to minute long ads every 3 songs than complete that shady looking transaction."
Podcasts aren't able to play at all even when the play button was hit it's super annoying while ads still play normally
"Spotify genuinely is not a that bad of an app compared to the music apps which are available on play Store/app store, except for its gehraiyaan advertisements which are very constant and irritating now days. The groundless problem which I'm facing is that I'm not able to login into my account, normally after pressing the logout option we logout of the account or after deleting the app, in my case it's neither of them. I opened the app just to hear some music and what i saw was not acceptable, it"
"Decent content library, awful user experience. App constantly crashes or pauses for no reason in the middle of playing. Really missing my YT Music subscription!"
"The most recent update has messed with everything. My recently played shows nothing at all, I can no longer hit the Play button on my headphones to get the music to stop and the widget in my drop down won't swipe away, you need to close the whole app to rid of it. Come on Spotify, you can do better"
"From quite many days, there is some bug in spotify where it says ""No Internet connection available"" even though my internet connection is perfectly fine. This problem comes up only when connected to wifi. Works fine with mobile data."
"Max volume seems very reduced after MIUI 13 update on Xiaomi 11T 5G, please update to fix it."
Fix your app . We customers pay for the plan and you guys just kick us out saying this account don't exist?? Why are we paying our hard earned money for it then?? To listen to our fav music... and to make sure this app doesn't disappoint us...well it did...fix it and suit yourself up
"The app is good, I have been using it for a cople of years. But today spotify was acting up. At first, It didn't show my songs, the buttons didn't work, and then out of nowhere my account got deleted."
"This app was originally 5/5 but recently it's been crashing and having all kinds of problems. I got logged out so I logged back in and ALL of my liked songs are gone, and I spent TONS of time building a great library, at least 8 years. And it's all gone, VERY disappointing. Might uninstall entirely."
Today my app crashed few times and surprisingly I don't have the access to my account anymore 🤯 not quite sure why is this happening
(Premium User) There have been quite a few glitches as of late that I've noticed especially with the use of podcasts. I just got logged without warning from all devices as well AND their entire contact page for customer service is down 👎👎 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
"I just updated the app and now it's not letting me access my account. Every time I try to login into my account, the app would open the create account window and then doesn't allow me to access my account. I really wanted to listen some music before sleep but now my whole mood is ruined. Fix this asap! 2 stars coz I love this app even though it spoiled my mood."
Good selection but constantly have problems with UI and with not being able to listen to downloaded music without an internet connection. Also have been signed out and can not sign back in for no reason
"Spotify used to be good but this new update ruined it, it just randomly signed me out and now I can't even sign back in. Please fix this it's actually annoying."
Constantly bugs out after using it with android auto. I have to force stop app and restart to get player ui to show up again in app. It also has a bad habit of signing me out frequently.
"I really like spotify but sometime idk what happend. everytime i want to hear a song i want, it didnt let me it only showed shuffle button only"
"Adding bottom-right ""+"" button is a bad UX choice, already exist various methods to create playlists, why we need a new one? There should be placed ""library"" that is rn moved to left. Please, consider removing the button or moving to left, before ""library"". Overall, app is great."
"Your new update sucks, I wish you could turn back the side button for scrolling better, I can't choose my other songs on p-z cuz my finger hurts for too much scrolling."
Deleted the app. too many ads now. Can't choose your own songs not enough skips. Ruined a good thing out of greed. Going back to YouTube where I get unlimited skips and less ads. And I can pick the song.. and better if you pay for premium. you dummasses
"the app is amazing but, i feel as though im listening to ads other than music and i find it quite stupid that i cant really shuffle my songs around and that if i want to get rid of these then ill have to pay and i think thats kinda stupid. especially having to pay to shuffle my music more than like 4-6 times or something like that."
"Smartplay sucks on spotify. every device doesnt remember at all what current device is playing and will auto take over, so if you're playing on a tv & open your phone, the session on the tv disappears. very terrible ux"
"Scrolling through likes songs is horrendous, they're used to be a little tab you could slide that would show the date/letter based on how your music was sorted, there was a recent ui update that not only made the UI look like dogshit but navigation is also dogshit now"
"When it's working, it is terrific. Updates only seem to cause error and malfunctions. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and there is little change. UPDATE March 2022 - new phone, zero improvement. Restart required every time an update is downloaded, when no other app I use requires one. Latest trick is a default to shuffle mode - as a premium user I should be able to choose what I listen to, and the order."
"Decent streaming app, Aside from a few annoying points, + Double ads (the second of which is usually absolute trash and time waste) + Searching a song and getting an album/playlist that doesn't include the song I searched. +Limited skips ( to be fair, I can always download the songs I'm looking for and not use this app, limited skips is going to prove bad for your app/service, and because you limit the unpaid skips, I simply won't join premium) Verging on a disappointing user experience"
"Hi dev team, overall very happy but I still do not have lyrics showing up on my Pixel 6, Android 12 (january patch installed) with the latest version of the app. Already tried for e quitting the app and removing all local data. Also I would appreciate if the private session toggle could be permanently set. Can't see a reason, for paying customers, why it is not possible to listen privately to your music. Edit: Lowering the score because still no lyrics. Phone and app on latest update"
"Love the service, hate the support. It is impossible to cancel a subscription on mobile, and the pc app freezes my computer. Guess I have to login on the web app and quit from there? Anything but convenient, and I know that is intentional."
The lyrics provided by musixmatch on most of the songs are WRONG to the point where the songs' meaning get totally ruined. I have been on premium for a while I see it allt he time. Take the time to check those lyrics please.PLEASE. Check AZlyrics for the correct lyrics instead. And maybe ask them to provide lyrics on this app.
"SO BAD! While I was listening to my songs, it paused and everytime i click the play button it says i need to pay...! Wouldnt recommend use YOUTUBE instead😉"
"I love the PC version of this app. It allows me to pick whatever songs I want to listen to, but the fact that the mobile version don't have that option is really frustrating. I arrange the music I listen to, in a way that suits me. That is not an option here. It is really bad, and I hope that you fix this. (Edit) so I realize that the ability to what I want is a premium option, which is complete bullcrap. Why is it only on the mobile version, like seriously."
"Lots of bugs, UI isn't intuitive"
"It's such an counterintuitive app and so bad. The experience of watching/ listening it's so clunky, just annoying. I really use it for podcats I can't find anywhere else, but it's unnerving."
"Spotify duos user for more than year. Great app. But 2 stars as sharing songs by Link is not working, needs to be fixed quick as it is really annoying."
"Just why? When I click on a playlist it just plays random songs that aren't even related to the artist. This hasn't happened to me in all of the years of using spotify, until now. You can't even preview songs in a playlist anymore you can only see the names. They have also for some reason removed the go back to last song played button, you can now only skip or pause, and even worse the button is STILL THERE meaning that they just won't let me use it. Just what the heck happened Spotify?"
"Edit, dropped to 2 stars now as i can no longer just hit shuffle play from my playlist when im on it, iv suffenlu got an extra button, comparing with same version on wifes phone and she doesnt have it, seems to only require it on 1 playlist. I will fix this review when you fix your issues, i am a pod host and prem user. . You can do better than this guys, let me play my shuffle, so youve taken away people being able to shuffle albums and such because of ADELE f ing Karen . Really. No shuffle 😒"
"The app is good, but the ads are a real pain. I understand you have to run adds, but you should at least consider my preferences when running ads. I listen to quiet, calming music during my work, and the ads are often for songs that I would never, ever listen to, and they tend to be quite disruptive. I can't work with that. Unfortunately it didn't work for me."
"Spotify, IMO while better than the alternative, is quickly going downhill. There's significant uptick in forced marketing that you can't opt out of in the paid subscription, constant push of 2nd and 3rd rate obscure artists, and what feels like bloat content constantly being shoveled through your dashboard just to give the impression of fresh content. As a paid subscriber, you have no ability with which to stop the nonsense."
"My experience was subpar at best. Who working for Spotify thought making the free plan shuffle only? That is the dumbest design choice I have seen in some time, and I am saying that knowing Youtube removed the dislike button. If I made a playlist I should be able to listen to it in whatever fashion I see fit, not use six skips and wait an hour to hear the song I wanted to listen to an hour prior. Change that and maybe you will be worth a better rating."
I personally love Spotify BUT the new update where you can't shuffle from the button is ANNOYING. I have to keep skipping to find the song that i like more . It's so FRUSTRATING when i can't re shuffle it and it needs to be fixed.
"Bring back the shuffle button in personal playlists. I'm indecisive, I can't choose but with that button it chose for me, now it's gone. Bring It Back."
"Good service with many annoying bugs. The playback notification often breaks, the ""liked"" icons on songs are unreliable, the animations still aren't fluid, there is no friend activity in the mobile app, etc. Also, the desktop app is very laggy, slow, and unresponsive, the friend activity extremely unreliable and broken, Spotify sync often can't connect and is quite unreliable, connecting to Spotify sync and disconnecting again resets the volume of the desktop app, and every update worsens it."
After my galaxy s10+ for one UI 4.0 this app keeps on stopping playing. Then I uninstalled Spotify app and reinstalled it and the app just says something went wrong try again and it is an endless loop of that
"At first it was good but these days, it's hard for me to update buy the premium. It always said that it's unable to connect. It has been weeks actually and it's started to get in my nerve. Please repair it quickly, thanks."
"I can listen to songs, and thats good. BUT. There is 2 problem. Whenever I try to play songs without premium, it plays a different song. Please dont do that my free time is ruined aaaaaaaa"
"Used to love Spotify but something happened in the last month where the app quit connecting to the Spotify app on two separate head units in my vehicles. Would be a shame of they did this to force people into buying the Spotify ""car thing""."
Spotify... what on earth happened to the shuffle button on mobile? I can no longer shuffle my playlist like I could before. I have Premium so its not because of that and I've already reinstalled the app.
"This spotify is simply awesome. Unfortunately this time, I don't know how could be this happened, bcs... when I tried to repurchase weekly premium by using phone credit, the unable to connect always occurs several times, whenever i click the button on the screen. Therefore, I can't use my premium, eventhough this app has been updated. Please repair this problem or give some actual explanation. Thank you."
"I have no doubt to say that Spotify is the best app for listening songs. But recently I have got one issue relating to it. Whenever I listen music, I don't find the play button in my notification bar. It was useful to quickly stop the music or to change into another. I wish, if this system comes back, I will trust this app with my eyes closed."
"Each update systematically ruins the usability of the app, I'll have to move to deezer in a few updates."
"Very difficult to search, ux is not intuitive. Apps do not remember last played tracks and do not sync among different devices - desktop and mobile."
I cant play my music offline even after ive saved them to listen offline please address this quickly cause i like my music
"great music and quality, however the unequivocal amount of adverts in-between, even just the ""you now have 30 minutes of add free music"" is 15 seconds long, for a single message to a listener, they want you to spend money and such, I prefer YouTube music if I am honest."
"Ok, I enjoyed Spotify back in the day... Now apparently I'm stuck with shuffle play, it's annoying just let me listen to my playlist in order, not only that the ridiculous amount of ads ruins the vibe, I know it's a company and it needs to make money but damn they be giving me 12 ads every 2 songs, premium isn't even worth the money, overall it has good sound quality and it's very easy to use, but please... Stop giving me an absurd amount of ads..."
I download podcasts at home on Wifi and when I get to work to play them it makes me redownload almost all of them via Data. What's up with that? My building blocks out connection so I can't just listen via Data either. Also the app consistantly has problems loading my downloads playlist when I am not connected to internet. Why should this be problem when the podcasts are downloaded?
I click the link that my friend sent me but for some reason Shuffle is on and no matter what I do I can't play the actual song she freaking sent me. Spotify has never been intuitive. Better to just use YouTube
Did the person who created this new UI not use any technology ever? Why can I not control scroll down in a playlist that way I used to you
"App overall works good. Problem is I have every notification turned off in the app but for some reason it started to notify me everytime I connect to my vehicle! Also, quite creapy saying, ""Going for a drive?"" Talk about privacy issues!"
"Every update makes this app less and less usable. For some reason they removed the ability to quickly scroll through music by first letter, no idea why. Seriously considering switching to Amazon music. Not happy at all, especially while paying $11/month"
Far too many ads. Ruins your listening experience.
"My Spotify is currently having a problem. Ever since Monday, Spotify hasn't been letting me listen to full albums. Like everytime I open an album, it just shows the shuffle button and there's no way for me to play the actual album. To the people working at Spotify, PLEASE FIX THIS!"
"Ther control buttons to go back, play/ pause or go to next song are completely gone. Also can't controll Spotify via my car when connected via Bluetooth. It is playing music tho. > Reinstalled it and the music buttons are back at the bottom."
The app keeps pausing the audio and the little tab won't come up when I pull down the quick menu which is annoying because I can't skip forward or rewind even on the app there's no progress bar coming up. Pls fix it it's annoying to have to pay for an app that doesn't work properly🙄
"Everything that is added makes this app worse. I don't want a 3 second video instead of the album art. I don't want my playlists to get ruined every other update. JUST STOP UPDATING, YOU ARE ACTIVELY MAKING IT WORSE"
Not happy with UI and search feature
"Spotify is really great service I use it quite a bit. I wish they would bring back car mode for the people who can't afford the $80 spotify ""car thing"" remote."
"Tooo many ads. However, quality is quite good."
"Been a premium member for over a year. Love the app but after the last update It quit fully connecting to the head unit in our cars (wife's did the same thing) music still comes through but it always says ""connecting""... Has to be controlled exclusively by the phone which really defeats the purpose of using it"
"Can you please add a button in podcast where we can download all the audios. Because we have to do it manually each audio podcast! And also, why is that I cant listen to a song I haven't downloaded when I'm using my data?! When I'm on premium! Please fix this and I will give you 5 stars."
When I thought the UI can't get any more worse it did. 3 clicks to just turn off shuffle. The algorithm is getting worse too. Thinking about shifting to Apple music in near future.
New update cut off alot of things for free listeners and the fact that we can't look through tracks anymore is HUGE turn off for the regular users and then there's no Loyalty for the fanbase that you've acquired over the years taking the option to choose..... UPDATE super laggy when it comes to liked songs really kills the experience I cancelled my subscription last month and still got charged wack
Worked great for a couple years but now it constantly freezes. The pause and play buttons stop working and I have to uninstall and reinstall. Also it no longer continues playing similar music when it runs out of a playlist.
"I only use it to discover music since the free version does not allow you to make use of many features. ***I felt I needed to mention this though: recently this app has been recommending to me VERY specific podcasts that ""happen"" to have to do with matters that I only talk with my friends about, meaning I never look this stuff up online, ever. So it's starting to feel quite creepy. Just saying :|"
Premium version? Best thing you could use for music. Free version? Worst thing you could use for music. Not only is premium almost required unless you wanna listen to ads half the time but it costs way too much just for a few features to be enabled
"It's a good app for streaming music. You can find almost every song that you want to listen. But! If you don't purchase 👛💸 its premium membership, then you will have a terrible experience. Between each and every song you will have two advertisement (1 minute total) describing how good the Premium Membership is! And this thing will just ruin your mood. ☹️ If you can afford rs.129 monthly for premium membership, then it's okay. It's a 5 star app. 👍"
"My review has been deleted because it is apparent you know what to do and you are hell bent on not improving the app. Just in case you want to improve UX; - Include a proper queue that shows played songs. - There's a difference between ""add to queue"" and ""play next,"" please add the latter option. - The app keeps shutting down and skipping songs. - The shuffle repeats songs already played. - Switching between home, search and my library shouldn't outrightly restart whatever one was doing, too."
"Used to be great, but have since added multiple annoying ""features"" such as ""we added"" and removing the loop buttons. These changes are clearly meant to coax the listener into paying for premium ☹"
"I enjoyed the app for the first two weeks. It didn't suggest anywhere that I was on some kind of free trial. It then prompted me for a review, and I gave a good rating. Afterwards, it started to play ads and contained way less functionality. That's fine, and it's a reasonable app. But it was quite a disappointment after how it started."
App has been downloading songs everytime my phone resets and has been constantly shutting down or resetting for quite some time now. I has become a nuisance to use and overall It's ridiculous that an app this massive has these issues.
"Unblocking songs should have a confirmation step. I have accidentally blocked songs by not knowing what the button was or accidentally pressing the block button, and then I can't listen to the song even if I unblock it and then uninstall the app and reinstall the app I have to wait like 2 hours before I can listen to the song again, there really must be a confirmation pop up to confirm blocking a song instead of making it immediate most annoying thing ever."
"Subtle inconveniences, such as opening a sponsored ad for a specific song, then not hearing that song, instead shuffled songs from that artist. Algorithm is a little weak compared to SoundCloud as well, doesn't quite pick out the right genres, I might be wrong though."
"They show too many ads, it's almost desperate. It has ruined the overall experience. It was my favourite app. Guess it's time for a new free app."
"I want to ask if the version of Spotify does change by location? As it has a complete different UI in India than in the UK. The UK version has a lot of restrictions such as, one can't play songs directly in playlist or likes playlist but have to play by shuffle and can't skip more than some songs in an hour. The Indian version was very flexible and user friendly while UK version is pathetic. Please throw some light on this"
"I've been using Spotify premium for the last few years and I'm starting to get sick of green color, the UI never changed since first Spotify... You need to make few themes that we can switch to or at least make a light/dark theme like all the other apps.. Also, all your competition have hi-res audio already, Spotify is the only service that still plays songs in 256kbps... And the last thing, there is no way to listen to local files through Spotify connect speakers at home!!!!???! Spotify wake up"
Compares very badly when compared to Pandora app. Spotify still doesn't have a decent algorithm to suggest new songs which we might like based on our ratings. Music selection and podcast selection are very good but too many ads ruin the experience.
The UI while I'm in the car is so frustrating. The car thing isn't available in my country. I can't actually manage music anymore.
"Spotify is a very good app for listening to music with. And I understand you want people to buy premium. but for people without premium, when you select a certain song, the app will pretty much always play another song, and I've read somewhere, that this is INTENDED behavior, you could have done anything else annoying to make people buy premium, but that pretty much ruins the app. People can just go somewhere else for music, premium has good features, but you ruin the app for people without it."
"Perhaps the most questionable UI/UX decisions I've ever seen. Why would you remove the 'My Songs' search bar at the top? Why make scrubbing through tracks less sensitive to touch? Less bells and whistles, more focus on functionality. Tell your product designers to step it up."
Good service terrible app. It worked really well for a while but over the past it will just either not load quickly it will not react to input. It'll go 20 seconds before playing the song I selected and skipping doesn't work sometimes. Really annoying to have premium and have so many technical issues on the app. It will also just randomly stop my songs or won't let me seak on a track. Works fine on my computer but just not on my phone. I tried reinstalling and clear cache but nothing helps.
Used this app for precisely long enough to realize that it wasn't about the learning curve; it was about the app lacking the basic features that make others so fluid. Maybe I'll come back in a couple of years...
UI is atrocious and the online customer service chat takes forever to get an issue resolved. I seem to have ended up with two accounts and it is impossible to identify which is which for the purpose of password reset. This is because you cannot see which email address is linked to the account in app... Very frustrating UI
"App is designed for kids lacking the attention span to enjoy an album. Should have an option to open Band- then automatically list albums in chronological order, not backwards. Shuffle should be removed."
"The last few updates have not only made it harder to listen and navigate in the car, but now won't even show the music slider or pause button when you're on the app."
"Nice mixes, but I wonder who came up with the genius idea to force sync music between devices. I'd like to listen to separate stuff on my PC and smartphone, instead I have to constantly switch playlists. Also, no idea why you don't allow viewing previous songs in the queue. I thought that YouTube music had bad UX, not so sure anymore."
"In recent updates the media player bar itself is completely broken both in app and in my notifications area on my Note 20U 5G. A soft reset of my phone does fix it temporarily but it always occurs again within a couple days. Sure it's a small inconvenience, but this actually completely ruins music control, songs don't continuous play, I can't control Spotify from my watch when it happens and I can't kill audio without killing the whole app. Fix pls. Very inconvenient at times."
"Ugghhh... Im not a complainer but PLEASE fix all the recent glitches. Used to be a great app. I pay for premium now but can't take this forever. Most common issue: Often just black screen when click open and app won't even start (daily, have to restart phone, other apps work fine) Currently I'm in Offline mode (via settings)& locked out b/c it won't let me log in and says Error, you're offline! play button/shortcuts don't work anymore from pull down generic/phone menu (works with other apps)"
"New update on group sessions has ruined the experience, since the scan to join feature has been removed it is difficult to join plus the option to choose whether I play through my device (as a session member) or only through the hosts device is now gone so any member has to have their divice muted the whole time. I understand this feature is still in beta so hopefully this can be resolved."
Almost tempted to return to radio or other players due to not being able to play albums in order just cos you're not premium. Functionality is curtailed to what they want you to do and not user experience. Ads also reliant on gambling etc
"Offline mode is very glitchy. And it's cumbersome to turn off and on. Why no button for it on the homepage rather than having to dig into settings? It must be a much-used function surely, given we're using our MOBILE phones to use the app, roaming around in WiFi-free zones?! Often it doesn't work at all, can't find my downloads, and I waste minutes fiddling around with the app trying to make it work. Needs a serious rethink."
The app is recommending me to add songs that I already have in my playlist. That never happened before. It's a useful tool to discover new songs based on my playlist but now is useless. It don't even recognize that the song is already added if I press the + button.
"Terrible for music listening.. when singles are clicked most of the times there's nothing coming after them.. algorithms don't build ""playlist"" based on that song like yt music does.. it's only good because there is Joe Rogan, one more star is for him, otherwise would have rated 1"
The UI for podcasts is horrible and it never remembers where I was. Thank goodness the JRE is the only Spotify exclusive podcast that I listen to!
"Can't access downloads without connection. It's so absurd, I download things because I love in an area that doesn't have cell reception everywhere. The app tries to load entire libraries before it will allow navigation to downloads. Negating the entire purpose of downloads. Plus the navigation is just silly/unintuitive."
"Fix the bloody fwd rwd buttons, they don't work when my phone is locked and I know its happening to others too. It also gets stuck on a song or podcast on the screen but it's playing another. It stays stuck for a few minutes then freaks out, shuts down and you have to reopen. I'm really considering moving to Deezer. I pay for premium but still get the in-podcast apps that I then can't easily fwd through without unlocking my screen."
"Terrible user experience since the last update, select a playlist and it plays a completely different one under the selected playlist name. Buggin out badly. Paid for premium family for years now, sort it out or I will cancel."
"I just want to search and play a damn song. No, I don't want my selected song to be shuffled randomly in some God awful playlist. Just sort your awkward UI and maybe this app wi be worth using."
"I've been using Spotify for long time and I've got to say, the latest updates really ruined the whole experience. The ads are fairly tolerable, but the limited controls make no sense whatsoever. Random songs I have never heard of keep playing, limited skips, frequent crashing, etc,. There's honestly no point in using this app comfortably anymore."
This app would be good if not for it taking over any device it is on. I start comp. There's Spotify starting up. I start phone same problem. I know I could change it and problem solved but that is just one example of little annoying little insertions into my daily life. There's also the fact if I start it on android there is no quick way to stop the app. And even when I do stop it there is still the notification to continue listening I want to. That is not helpful it is annoying and needy
"I used to like how spotify was before now it just sucks like you can only have 6 skips for one hour, you cant even pick the song you want you have to click shuffle, you cant go back to previous songs which is very annoying and dont get me started on the ads. It just feels as if they are pressuring us to buy premuim. Overall they have just made the app less likeable. Edit: i just found out you cant even peak at the next song unless you have prenium. Spotify please fix your app🤦🏽‍♀️"
"I can't enhance my playlists after clicking the button, and it keeps saying that I don't have an internet connection even though I'm connected to my data. It does the same thing when connected to my WiFi."
"Ruined by constant commercials! On the Chilled Jazz channel, a channel playing NO known or mainstream artists, they play 3 commercials for every TWO songs. 7 minutes of music then 3 commercials back-to-back-to-back. Goodbye Spotify, you suck."
"You can't have a playlist over 700 plus songs or else the app will just randomly skip backwards and forwards and then it will just quit the playlist, After many attempts to skip back to the orginal song you wanted. Other then that great app and easy user interface."
"Spotify is just as useful as it can be I guess... But I'm completely disappointed now I can't even listen to a certain song, I pick a song then click the play button. But it plays another different song which is annoying and I can't even do anything about it, I try to try it on other songs and yet it's still that way. If you guys can do something about this please do."
"Issue reported in Feb: Metadata won't change song info in car anymore. Tried all suggested fixes. I have android moto G and I have owned 2 completely dif cars this year. Really used to love Spotify, I hate to cancel my paid membership, but I refuse to pay for something that doesn't work the way it's advertised. Also, Help suggests you ""+vote and add additional info"", but the buttons are ""greyed out"" so they're unavailable. Bummer Spotify!"
"For the premium price it is quite buggy. Whenever I use the Spotify app with the Yamaha Musiccast most of the wifi speakers get unresponsive and after hard reset have to reconfigure the system. In car over bluetooth doesn't play after few ca 20 minutes. With every update i get curious which bug is next and which function is not going to work... Tried Deezer, no such problems and Hifi quality. Also playlists are usually as good as few first songs."
"I'm an avid podcast listener and a premium member AND I STILL CAN'T TURN OFF SHUFFLE! Why do you make it so hard?! Other reviews mention the same issue! I've uninstalled the app, I've logged out and back in... AND THE SHUFFLE STILL WON'T TURN OFF! If it wasn't for the music selection, I'd be using Castbox instead to get all my podcasts, because the UX of Spotify is lousy."
"How does one listen podcasts on shuflle? I mean why? Who does that? And then you make shuffle always on on podcast mode and the user can't switch it off. Rocking the newest version, Premium plan, uninstalled and installed the app again, double checked shuffle isn't on on music mode. Episodes still shuffle on like cards at a casino. Seriously fix this. Just make the shuffle button accessible on playlist mode. That simple."
App switches off when phone screen goes off. This does not happen with other apps. When using it for exercise if another app interrupts it such as run keeper it doesn't always start playing again. This does not happen with other apps I use such as BBC Sounds. Interface gets stuck for example I can listen to a podcast and the screen thinks I'm listening to a different podcast. Overall quite frustrating.
"The podcast user experience is non-intuitive, clunky, and frustrating. Navigating to my episode of choice takes 4x as long as competing podcasting applications. Music functuonality is wonderful."
"Second star is only for huge choice of music spotify offer. App is incredibly unintuitive,music won't sync beetween devices, a lot of button pressing just to go back to the list you just been on. When you choosing the artist it takes 3 clics to go to actuall discography otherwise you'll only listen to 5 most listen songs by others. Very little customisation option, it will literally force you to listen to music it chooses for you. Sad, there are ads in paid version."
Pixel 6 phone. Unable to play Spotify app .no aux connection. Bluetooth pairing is only able for my phone calls in my jeep. Adapter cable to make aux doesn't fix problem. No sound coming from speakers. Buy aux works fine on other phone with speakers.
"This app sucks for people who haven't bought premium. Genuinely I can't go through one song without hearing an ad. They tell you that they'll give you the chance to listen to songs without interruptions for 30 minutes but that's an absolute fib. This won't make me spend my money on the app. And also with the random crashes. I'd be listening to Doja Cat and all of a sudden, the music stops. I go back into the app, turn the song back on and not even 5 seconds later it crashes again. FIX THE APP."
Bugs that never get fixed. Songs jump when phone wakes from screen off when in Car Mode. Car mode activates on Bluetooth regardless of whether enabled or not. Bluetooth connected device only displays first song played then never updates from track to track. Shuffle default button option even for official albums. Should be play unless specified. Otherwise. Evidently paying for bugs that never get resolved. Audio quality and library remain top quality so thank you for that at least.
"There's a way to move your downloaded songs to the SD card but it is very badly designed. Whenever my phone turns off all of them need to be redownloaded, and sometime the app won't even open after restarting my phone."
"bro ok look this app is sick right, but like i can't get through 10 minutes of music without the music pausing itself no matter what. ive tried going into the settings checking for backround usage and its all turned on. its just a bug on the apps end which has gotta get fixed. without that bug itd be 5 stars but tbh it just completely ruins the point of the app if it stops every couple of minutes."
"An ap I pay for and continually have to uninstall and reinstall. It will quit playing randomly, not play podcasts is today's issue, and so on. Disappointing."
Iam really tired of getting yelled at by some old lady telling me to get the shot. And how hog wash it is. It's to annoying I know I have my music built up and save in Playlist I like. But just can't stand the ads they have on here rn ehhh
"So I actually love this app but very recently (20 minutes ago) the app has gone to completely unusable. The desktop application works normally, but the mobile app freezes as soon as I press any button, rendering it completely useless. What's weird tho is I can cast music from my computer to my phone and it works. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it hasn't solved the issue."
Y'all gotta fix this app in the next update what were you thinking. Since this last update Spotify has been crashing every single time I turn off my phone and let the music play and once I turn the phone on there it goes. Starts playing again. What kind of nonsense is that. Fix this quick before Spotify goes to the garbage for me
The play screen keeps freezing meaning you can't skip songs without quitting the app and re-entering. Only started doing this after the most recent update.
"Randomly stops working, will play one song at a time and then quit, timer of the song keeps rolling well passed the length of the song, plays random songs not in my playlist, shuffle seems to always play some songs and never others, closing and reopening app fixes nothing. Very annoying"
"If im honest, i love the app and the wide variety of music, however the way artists are treated is horrible. Also this year's spotify wrapped was such a disappointment. Next to the fact that the graphic design was VERY lackluster, the slides took too long to load, the app tried to be ""relatable"", and last but not least: the genres that were absolute trash. DreamSMP is not a genre, Anime is not a genre, nobody knows what ""weirdcore"" is and more problems with the genres."
"Apple music is better than plans, quality and more importantly the freedom to download any single song from the album instead of downloading the entire album like in Spotify.. only one thing I love about Spotify is the UI super clean"
"Dec 2021 update:Spotify Wrapped 2021 feature seems to have bricked the app. Choosing item hangs while the new play button next to 2021 unwrapped just circles. ----------- Earlier update: Update has killed casting of my Spotify Premium. Ive reinstalled app, reset router, reset Chromecast Audio and no change. Google Music is still streaming fine to the Chromecast. I was literally streaming fine until todays update"
"I want to clarify the Spotify service itself is solid, but this app is terrible. Bad UI, a plague of bugs, unnecessary ''updates'' that only break the app further. Not to mention it lacks most desktop features. Connecting with google devices or PlayStations for example, I'd say it works %33.4 of the time. At this point, I've stopped letting it update. It's all downhill from here. I do appreciate the smart watch connectivity though. Great service, terrible app."
"Terrible UI, finding podcasts in a non-native language is horrendous. Features like showing which artists are in my library doesn't exist (F.e. Armin van Buuren with 10 songs)."
"The default to shuffle on a list including albums with the green play button confirms their musical ignorance. The large play button is the natural way to start playing a list that goes to an unnatural order of playing.....yes we can toggle it off...Yes we can click on the first song to avoid shuffle...but it's not intuitive. Otherwise good app, save for there is no alert when a song you have liked or added to a playlist is dropping off the platform or being restricted."
"The adds are really irritating seriously. It makes me feel to delete this app, rest all good the songs collection are very good also the design of this app is build good. And you should learn something from discord as I understand even you guys want to earn but there are many other ways to earn like discord never shows irritating adds like you do and still they earn because they have offer people what they really need like batches and cool stuff"
After the latest update on Spotify there seems to be a bug where the app hangs for a minute or two and then the app crashes. This keeps repeating for quite a while.
"I am not able to shuffle certain auto created playlists. In the playlists I created, I am not able to play in a sequence. This sucks. It was so much better before. This wasn't the case like 2 months back. Not sure what changed. I would like to be able to shuffle or play in sequence in any playlist. I do not see a shuffle button at all in the now playing section."
"Hard to find the music I already like, autoplay setting isn't respected when I cast to another device. Big ""play"" button on an album automatically shuffles the album rather than playing it through. In general, Spotify doesn't provide a great experience for people who like to listen to albums, instead catering only to those who like random mixes of songs suggested to them."
"It works, but managing my queue, getting multiple songs to download, buttons for adding things, it's just so painful, unintuitive. It's not better on a computer, but on mobile i just hate it"
"Ever since the android 12 update, sound quality has taken a big hit even if I stream high quality. I also have to force quit the app each time I want to use it with Android auto 😐"
Fix your damn app. New bugs after new bugs. The app takes a million years to start. Half the time it requires a force stop and clearing cache. What's wrong with yall? It's literally one app and it's never stable.
"Just canceled my premium subscription. App keeps stuttering when the screen is off (S21, Android 12). Deezer doesn't do that, so I'm pretty sure Spotify can be fixed to resolve such issues... I see the same complaints in the forums going back a couple of years now. The UI & UX needs some work too."
Car mode no longer works or was seemingly removed from the app after the latest update. Very annoying to deal with standard UI while driving now. Please fix this.
"Spotify is decent. Has a few frustrating quirks, such as insisting on having a data connection to view my downloaded music and podcasts."
"This app is so frustrating now. This is why I dont update my apps, man. It take 2-3mins just to open my liked playlist, if it even opens. Then the like button stops working so I have to uninstall the app and re-install it to get it to work. That only last a month before U have to do it all over again. I wouldn't care on a free app but I paying for this shiznit brah and Im a cheap guy so PLEASE SORT THAT ISH OUT!"
"Started okay,app was fluid and seemed decent, recent changes howeve; no full album reveal after search the tab is there to reveal the tracks but it does nothing. Tracks playing despite switching to another having to close app to get music to stop (this happens often) Seems odd as It was working great few days ago. I see no updates on playstore... And yet... disappointment..."
"Needs uninstalling and reinstalling at least once a month. Just randomly out of the blue it'll stop ""liking"" tracks when I push the button. As noted by other users it frequently shows the song information for a song that finished a while ago, and sometimes wont let you pause a song, with the song continuing after you stop the app. Rather buggy, rather frequently."
"The App is nice. But the ads are too long, two 30 second ads back to back like WHAT. It would be so kind if u reduce it to 15 seconds. And what is the purpose of the 10 second explanation about u can enjoy the next 30 min of uninterrupted listening, like this is too much. I am moving to RESSO music if this is continuing, heard it's not as greedy as you."
Used to be my go to for listening for years but has gotten far more unstable and glitchy. I quit paying for premium quite some time ago but it's not worth it with so many other options available. Plenty of potential but tired of being spammed with ads that tend to brick the app and make listening a chore.
Super glitchy. Regularly have to force quit app. Songs pause at random. Controls regularly and inexplicably disappear from lock screen.
"- Pay for premium but still get ads on Podcasts - Will load your phone with downloaded songs with no clear way to stop it from doing so - Inconsistency between desktop/Mobil features + Algorithms are pretty good at recommending music you will actually enjoy Overall I get the feeling that their main goal is to get you to buy premium, rather than trying to fix bugs, improve the UI, or come up with new and useful features."
"Minimalist design and best song suggestions but somo of my favourite songs are not able to play anymore. When ever i try to play those songs it sows ""you discovered the premium feature"". Please fix this bugs."
"The UI shuffles playlists around on the home screen just as I go to select one.I end up selecting the wrong one. If Spotify shows results, it should COMMIT."
"Seriously! What the hell with this update! No setging option on webplayer, still the autoplay and the shuffling mode not fixed, we cannot listen to the music on the playlist normally! And guess what! The problem raised since 1 year! No one cared to improve the UX neither the UI with this unfound links and buttons!"
"i use Spotify premium a lot and am quite happy with it, when it works, i really like the song radio. sadly, way to often the app needs 3 minutes to open i think its connected to the amount of songs i downloaded. while using it you just experience way to often how inefficient it is coded. an app like Spotify should run on a brick. but it even bugs and lags on a decent phone. i constantly have to reinstall it and eh."
"Inconsistent UI when playing music, sometimes shuffle button is hidden. All should be consistent between iOS and Android when it comes to UI placement. Not well optimised when it comes to battery usage."
Don't get my wrong this app is amazing but recently been having a few faults with the like button being very glitchy and also weirdly the app constantly been asking for my bank details recently when without fail I always pay on time every single month!
"It's good for podcasts and nothing else. Please stop asking me to rate the app or upgrade to premium, it's overpriced, i'm not doing it. You can't call yourselves a music streaming app when you can't meet the most basic requirement of such an app. If i can't search for and listen to a specific song you are not a music streaming app, you're a glorified radio station. Again, not interested in premium because it's overpriced. There is your rating, please leave me alone."
"Fine to play music, but not Android-friendly. User has to force-stop the app to remove it from notification area, or to spontaneously play music (for ex. when Bluetooth connecting). App would start from itself when playing Spotify on a computer... all that nonsense. Part of setting screen taken by play notification, and other UI problems."
"Kind of ""unfair"" I liked the other update before this one, unbearable. The do aren't the thing. You have to use skips to even play the songs on a playlist if you want it to play together. I mean, WHO DOES THAT??? I really loved spotify, but now it's just go premium or nothing. I'd rather go the other update before this one. If you just wanna face fun and listen to music, I don't really recommend it. But on the laptop version, it's all fair. That's a thing y'all have to fix quickly or I'll quit"
Glitchy and slow. It pauses and changes your music and just starts glitching out. It just ruins your mood it has a lot of songs and podcasts but the glitches need to be fixed
"When I was using free version I could use the equilizer feature in the app but since I upgraded to Spotify premium equilizer disappeared. Now its worhless for me, It was better to use free version than the premium one."
"YouTube is way better than this!, It has Remixes and songs if you create a playlist, you have next video button, video, there is nothing like If I have to play a playlist I have to shuffle it, Skip Button for long ads and is simple."
"Spotify app for android has a very poor design (Okt. 2021). They have hidden simple things like a button for ""shuffle"", or changing how lists are sorted... not user friendly at all"
"App is great but have a lot of problems, the most annoying is the delay when pressing a button and the ""Go Online"" when selecting a song or song option... hope this get fixed soon..."
"Please fix the bugs! Songs keep pausing at random, when phone is locked but not only. The search function before the update was great, you could search for a specific song and the following tracks were similar so it allowed to discover new music. Now this doesn't work. The radio was similar too but now I can't search or add any stations. New design is good but functionality needs fixing"
"Developers keep making the app worse. The new Playlist radio is completely useless, since it doesn't match the vibe of the playlist but instead plays songs that are in other of my playlists.. Also the design gets changed every few months. Why do I have to filter for my playlists instead of just have a category for it?! Who is making these decisions?!"
"Just missing some really potentially nice features like swiping on a song to que it would be nice, and the layout has been pointlessly redesigned so many times that it gets annoying to readjust to after a new update every few months"
The fact I have to get premium just to skip songs is absurd. I would also like it if I could press on my playlist and pick the song I wanna listen to first instead of clicking the play button and having it shuffled to a song I don't feel like listening to.
The apple version of this app is superior. This app has no lock screen scrolling or quick queue add via sliding the song left. The home screen is hard to navigate since the most recent update.
"The UI has gradually been ruined to the point where you have to wade through adverts and podcasts to try and find the music you might be looking for, even if you pay for premium. If the homescreen was configurable this would be massively improved, but instead podcasts are just shoehorned into everything regardless of whether you listen to them or not"
"Moved over from Google Play Music when they shut it down. Spotify is worse in every way and the app struggles with basic usability. I find it insane how inconsistent the play button behaviour is in terms of queuing, and the fact the app can sit there taking up 4GB of space but tell me that it has no music to play without internet is a joke"
I m quite dissapointes by the app itself:1. The find in playlist button dissapears once the playlist is enhanced. 2. Why can t i order tracks in a playlist alphabetically. 3. Why can t i add multiple songs to a playlist at once after e.g. keeping pressed and selecting several songs? Or an entire playlist to another playlist?
"I had to look through other reviews to make sure I wasn't the only one having this issue lately, it regularly stops and classes itself in the middle of songs with is quite frankly annoying. Not to mention having to listen to 5 ads just to listen to one song."
"Why is the free version so terrible? Ill look up a song,and then when i tap the play button ill get an entirely different song,not only that,but after an ad,your told you get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening,this is not true,because after that ad appeared,after experiencing the previously mentioned ""entirely different song"" problem, I went to another song only to get another 30 second ad,promising me the same 30 minutes ad free. Only reason i gave this two stars was because premium is good."
Used to be trouble free but lately the album cover screen freezes and skip buttons don't work. Music keeps playing on phone after disconnecting from Bluetooth. App is getting worse with every update Cancelled premium and I'm just gonna load up my phone with music. Really disappointed cause I really liked Spotify.
"Way too many ads which makes using the app really annoying, because I actually enjoy using spotify. But the ads just had to ruin the whole experience on the app."
This app honestly sucks. Since they updated it to the new version they have screwed everything up with this application. Uninstalled because of the problem with seeing full albums and that's when they play a shuffled version of it. You guys have ruined this app. No wonder its 4.4 stars. 😔
More of just a complaint about the phone versions of spotify. It is very annoying an quiet a bit unfair that tablet and pc users have more control of what they listen to on spotify than phone users. I personally think that spotify would be better if phones had the same freedom in options as the tablet and pc users.
too much minor UI issues. 1- if you open any artist there is no way you can scroll through the popular songs ( if there is the app doesn't tell where it is) you have to go to songs from discovery that is too tideous 2- the download button is not given in the song options you have to like the song to get it downloaded for no reason. My downloads are not arranged in one place the liked songs are different and the saved albums different. UX engineers please update the experience.
"When I play one of the playlists or songs, the app ig just going to show me random song that is recommended for me. I press play button couple of times but it just stops recommended song. It is like the songs are mixed so instead of one song the app shows you another. Please fix this it is very annoying."
"So I've had Spotify premium for many years but since the last update I'll have music on and it'll just randomly stop, like someone hit pause. It doesn't come back! Another thing is the display of music after it cuts out gets stuck on one song and won't change! Like the button's still work but the song name is stuck! Please fix this!"
Good design that is easy to understand After about a month it's not possible to listen to a specific song/album really hindering my overall expierience resulting in only the podcast section to be great.
"I loved this app when there was less advertisement, now they are showing too much of adds almost after every 3rd or 5th song. And ruining moods and forcing you to buy this app. I also bought this app once or twice but after the subscription ended i lost my playlist and every time i open this app the offline songs started redownloading and wasting too much of data so i stopped purchasing. Worst app ever in music category .if you want to ruin your mood just download it and ta da you'll get it done"
"Playback often gets detached from the persistent playback notification. No song lyrics. No feature to skip silent parts from songs. ""Now playing"" queue UI is strange (namely, can't scroll up to previous songs). And there's competition with more bang for the buck."
Most hated is the pathetic ability of running without a connection to data transfer. The random play algorithm is weak at best as songs will replay and others will perhaps never be heard without custom control. Release Radar and other suggestions In my opinion are not based on either my overall saved library or developing interests. Overall a competitive option other than Amazon would be quite welcome. I am quite close to dropping the paid version of this app.
"-- 10.2021 -- So there I was, on my porch, on my way re evening run. Typically took less than a minute for Versa 3 to lock GPS + me to trigger desired playlist. But the clowns again futzed the UI in a show-stopping manner. I'll save playlists to recreate elsewhere. These fools are hopeless. -- 06.2021 -- I wish they'd stop futzing with the UI, .. Ya get PopEye forearms from the excessive scrolling. Dumb revamp, but tolerable, barely. Premium Family, so no ads."
"I really liked Spotify before it was uploaded now you can't choose you songs,if you have a playlist you can't choose the music that will play, only premium can do that I think that this just ruins the point of the app👎."
"Ok so it is great we all know the purpose, but come on man like ads!?!, seriously a song later I received like 5 ads on how I should buy Spotify premium... And now I can't even wait for the song to switch automatically. I have to do it manually. it's great but guys control the ads, it ruins everything"
Ui is terrible. Dont think they make can make it any less intuitive trying to see the songs in a particular album. Building my playlist has never been harder
"This app is good, I love to hear songs in it but it says that ad will come after 30 minutes but after every Song I play I get interrupted by an ad...which actually ruins the feeling of hearing the song"
"I pay every month for Spotify but it's quite slow. And, offline mode doesn't even work. This app is basically a music renting service that requires internet."
"App has been working great. A few flaws and quirks here and there. However, today I found that every single podcast I tried to open or play has been replaced with a ""Try Again Later"" message and will not work no matter what. Reinstallation did not work, and no forums have shown any sign of help. Fix this now please!"
"It constantly closes, crashes while running, freezes, wont pause or play when you push the buttons and video is spotty. I updated it and problems still persist. Been trying to play Billy Corben JRE episode for 3 days now but cant get past 62 mins in. This has been ongoing since Joe came to spotify. When it does work its great but the bad outways the good im sad to say. Please advise."
"The app could be good, but there are many bugs. It doesn't work reliably with mobile data and doesn't load the custom user playlists properly quite frequently, which is annoying. Opening a session to listen to music with friends is only available on the app (on beta), and switching between devices doesn't work reliably yet, which is also a bit frustrating. It also shares the type of device you're using and your OS when you join these sessions, which isn't secure. Why not just use the username?"
Way too many ads Would wish too have fewer number of ads as it is too irritating between every two songs or every other song sometimes and the ads are quite long( can complete a song or half of a song ) the ads are just way too irritating which makes me wanna uninstall the app
"Sluggish development, no feature parity with desktop, podcasts still mediocre. Rarely are good features added, programming is slow. When ""hide songs from playlists"" finally came, it was only for the phone version. Why not on desktop?! Hidden songs are also not skipped if marked. Podcasts were added but it's still far from well designed. The downloaded icon for example looks more like a played marker. No option to mark as favorite. For such a big and established company surprisingly mediocre."
"Spotify you have changed! Categories are awful, too much annoying recommendations and you couldn't turn them off to a clean UI surface. And where are my top songs of PAST YEARS? I've been using the premium since 2017, 2021 version is the most disappointing update ever! At least give premium user a choice to turn off all the flamboyant album/playlist recommendations, enhanced features are superfluous! my eyes are sore!"
"It's a good app but, I Don't like the fact that they removed the option to choose which song you want it start on, and that you don't have unlimited skips, that just ruined the app of me."
"A small niggle to ruin a good experience. Why should I download every song and podcast I have again every time I am on wifi? And somehow I need to log in almost every time I am offline when I never signed out. As a paying consumer, I wonder why I'm not getting my music offline the way I should."
"This service is fantastic, however the app is awful. Often it completely freezes and I have to reinstall it in order to listen some music. I feel like a hostage. Moreover Linux support is really poor too. Hope they fix it bcoz I listen music every day up to 7 hours or more. Music is like oxygen to me :') I'm using Redmi 4, android 6.0.1"
I HATE the new forced shuffle play button. I want to listen to albums in the song order intended by the artist. They are making this more difficult than it should be by not having a standard Play button.
"Uses huge amounts of data. It should use WIFI connection to preload the songs, but it doesn't. It's only buffering a few seconds. Total waste of mobile data. I can't download all the songs and albums onto the phone. It's also huge amounts of data clogging up my phone then. They really need to come up with something better. UI hasn't changed for years and it's not that great. Yet, nobody seems to care and no improvement in sight."
"Premium user here. While using mobile data, the app says that it is not connected to the internet. This happens a lot and such problem is not seen in other apps such as Youtube. Please fix this as it ruins the experience."
"I'm already stressed with the fact that I use the paid version of the app and the songs crash SEVERAL TIMES a day. The ""play"" button shows that the song is playing but no sound is coming out. Resolve this as soon as possible as it is unbearable to use the app like that."
Before i paid for it had it for 3 months no problem..as soon as i started to pay 1 day my account hack 1 week later cant play the songs..always crash and dont allow me play the songs what are we paying for a service that always cant do what it was designed for..
"Good library. Poor ui. Can't see previous song in queue except by spamming previous button. If you wanna jump back several song back in your queue, yes spam the button blindly (i dont care about history thing, not the point). Cant see all song for an artist. Etc. Browsing music, library and queue is a pain. Im testing a bunch of music app, looking for a replacement for yt music. Spotify definetely has the worse ui. Id rather deal with youtube music buggy app."
"They Keep updating what was a user friendly product and keep making it more difficult and enraging to listen to podcasts. Instead of changing a product just for the sake of change so someone can justify their wage, they should keep their product functional and easy to use and what people have enjoyed and been paying for. Or at least be given the option to go back to before the changes ruined the ease of accessing and listening to podcasts. The updates are garbage."
It was fine but now Spotify has replaced the loop button with a 'hide this song' button and since it can't be undone(atleast to my knowledge)I've accidentally hid songs in my liked songs library and fsr they also changed the format? It was perfectly fine before and the updated one in my opinion is uglier.They made unnecessary and annoying changes that really didn't make any sense to do in the first place Edit:I forgot to mention they made it so you can only listen to snippets of the songs you c-
"The app used to work seamlessly. Now, it crashes every time I select a song to bring up its action menu (I.e. if I want to navigate to a downloaded song and put it in queue). It shows the loading animation briefly, then the app crashes. Also, I can't bring up my downloaded liked songs. Whenever I hit the ""liked songs"" button, it just loads perpetually. I've waited the entire 15 minute commute to work and it just doesn't finish loading - my downloaded music library isn't even extensive."
How on earth is such a prominent well funded app so flawed - often play button doesn't work. Basic! - searches to check app is online when you want to play downloaded music offline...defeats the purpose Looking for an alternative
I enjoyed it when it was functioning well. Today idk what happened i wss editing my playlist so it could be neat but i cant edit it anymore. I didnt even know that your own premuim account have a deadline. But atleast fix this. I cant even play full musics anymore. Like what the heck? You can put ads on it but why couldnt I fix it?. Yall need to do somethin about this. Might aswell download all this music that i found rather than being stress about this.
"It use to be quite good but as of recently it's started to glitch out. It takes ages for it to load anything and if you click on something too fast then you have to restart the app all together. It doesn't close properly sometimes either, it'll give out and have to have a forced shut down to stop music and not to mention it'll sometimes just glitch out what song is playing."
"This app has the worst UI of any major app I've used, at least for watching podcasts. Poor syncing between devices. The desktop version has similar issues. Needs a big overhaul."
Update from about a month ago introduced a new bug where the app ui will just randomly (and frequently) freeze despite music still playing. The only way to fix it is to force close Spotify.
"It doesn't offer what youtube music does, it doesn't feel fluid while scrolling, it takes a lot to download your songs, the radio sucks and apparently they don't care about user experience, they just make money from us"
"Who's stupid idea is it to make the play button shuffle? I know you can press start on the song but if I then pause and restart it automatically goes to shuffle. That means unlocking my phone to restart without shuffle.... Seriously stupid option that isn't user configurable. If I want shuffle I'll select it thanks, otherwise just make play do so in order"
"Please stop with your ads. If you think you can bully your listeners into buying Spotify, it's not going to work. Constantly asking me to upgrade to premium is just making me switch to another app. I honestly wouldn't mind of you advertise other companies. Genuine ads that you can earn as revenue from are not an issue. We watch those on YouTube and all is well. But honestly, stop with that ""premium lelo, premium lelo"" because some of us genuinely cannot afford it."
I liked it better before when you had the back button. Instead you put the like button there. If I didn't like the song I wouldn't have put it on my playlist...common sense.
"Suggestion algorithm is not good as it should be and absolutely need to search for good songs and create playlists manually. Well, cloud features are pretty good. Another feature that is lacking is the equalizer as a built in feature."
"It's quite irritating when they have all these feature but not on all phone, i don't even have the lyrics feature nor the blend percentage feature. I mean why bother to include this feature at all when some people can't enjoyed it, if it's true that all of these feature are still in development, then why not put it in the beta program rather than just random people get these feature."
The music is good but the ad for joining premium is too irritating. Almost after each song the come and ruin the mood they are so frequent i remember the script of the ad more than the songs. And the app is working super slow it takes more than 10 mins to load... Really a dumb app
"I love Spotify, but I hate the UI. I should be able to search for an artist and see a list of their songs, not give songs and then having to look through each album. It really is a terrible UI and is by far the worst thing about the app. It also crashes when swiping through podcasts. Considering this is a paid subscription service I expect better."
"I don't know what update they put in this, but its trash. I try searching songs and get the Playlist of the song and not the actual song. My liked playlist has a play button that lets you listen to PART of the song. NOT THE WHOLE ONE. I can't listen to the ones I want T_T. Please fix it, its annoying."
"The app is rly great but the annoying f**king ads is ruining it, Ik you need funds but at this point it is soo irritating that people are creating new apk clients for this and maybe it'll be the dawn of spotify if this keeps going on..just idk man try to cool it down a bit and the Spotify premium forced ads are Just makes me want to kill myself sometimes and it greatly affects the listener's experience and they sought out diff alternatives."
I dont quite know what the problem is but I literqlly just cant download spotify on my phone no matter what i have it on my laptop and it works perfectly fine but it just wont let me download the app for some reason I've tried so many times and I waited a couple of days in between each time and it still wont let me I dont know why
"There are no visible updates required but Spotify keeps crashing. The display won't change from the first song I play, and if I skip 3 songs the songs stop playing all together then I have to restart my whole phone. It's super annoying considering how much we have to pay for this"
"This was easily my favorite paid app, love all the options. Since I got a Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, the app is basically unusable. I'm very close to canceling my Premium and finding a new music app. No one can give me any answers and it's quite frustrating. Beware."
"I've been using this app since 2 years the number one issue ive been dealing with is when I want to go back to a certain song or press the reverse button it like won't let me. And 2, back then we get to choose any song we want and when I make a playlist I press a song I want and it only gives me seconds of the song and boom no more and I certainly always have to use shuffle play. But I'm just asking Is it because of the device I'm using???"
"I genuinely feel like im being made to go premium. Free ver is supposed to shuffle songs, but in actuality it doesn't shuffle in the word's proper sense at all. Most of the time i 'shuffle' liked songs, the app keeps replaying a tiny fraction of the playlist to the point i get utterly bored of them, and totally overlooks the newly added ones."
"Usually a great app, but recently the lock controlls don't have a ""play previous"" button. It has the favourite heart there instead which is extremely irritating."
Spotify is great but everytime i want a song it wont let me play it and it will glitch and ive checked my data? This is my issue that is quite annoying also when i want to add a song it shall not let me play the song i added and it will do it randomly so im sorry but 2 stars.
Think twice before using: buggy and unreliable app for which they should offer discounts on subscription. Infinite spinners when trying to navigate downloaded content; not working resume playback when re-opening the app from background; recently they've managed to mess up settings so that app started using cellular data even though on UI in settings you see that config disabled.
They say if you watch this quick video/ad that is abt 30 secs long you will get 30 mins of ad free music. Thats a huge lie. I was curious if that was true. Turns out only 11 mins went by not 30 before three 30 second ads came.
I love Spotify and have used it for years however I am having quite a few issues with the app recently. They're are a few bugs that definitely need to be worked out. I have to close the app fully and log back in to get it working again which is fine but for a paid service you'd expect it to be a smoother experience
Features are user-friendly however it's always saying I'm offline when I'm not. I am always with wifi so I don't understand why it kept saying I'm offline. Also recently it keeps on lagging. I could barely use it. I already tried unintall and installing the apl. I'm so close to discontinuing my premium.
I get it you folk got paid for showing ads but man 2 and in row is enough why u show 3 ads its not good even if I'm using free app . And now there is no 30 mint interption free music after a add not good jst ads wth no offer. Gotta switch to YouTube again ruin my experience.
"This was great till they removed the loop button and added random songs to the Playlist. I'll keep the app but I'm changing to a new app, and if this doesn't get changed in a year, I'm deleting it"
"This app is so bad. It seems it can be good, but the loading speed so slow, and my internet is ok. Half of the times the app wont even open. And the limited skips + lots of ads just ruin it. Listening music mixes on youtube is much better. This app needs a lot of rework."
"This is an oddly professional yet unprofessional app/company. I always use Pandora or any other form of media before I conform to Spotify; why? Because this app will just stop running while doing something that requires music. The amount of ads is exhausting, not to mention if you watch their ads that give you 30 minutes of ad free listening, it'll actually play ads like 12-15 minutes in (true stories). I get you gotta make money but Pandora gives ads every hour. Figure it out."
Great music suggestions. Terribly slow UI. Anytime you select the 3 dots you have to wait. Unacceptable to have backend calls or something delay user experience
"I've had Spotify for years, the last year it gitches and stops playing after a few songs, not friendly for hands free car driving if I have to reopen my app and push play every 3 or 4 songs! That is unsafe!!! Not to mention it drives me nuts. Says I done have permissions to allow background play but I have all those toggles set up to do it. I pay for premuim...I literally just reinstated my trump supporting pandora app which i had ditched bc of that reason but its WAY BETTER! Fix the glitch!"
I installed only to listen to Joe Rogan. For that it's a good app. But the interface and functionality are horrible. Slow loading and outdated user experience.
"I like the new design however I keep accidentally pressing on songs that are at the bottom of the screen, right between the home/search/library bar and the ""currently planing song"" bar. This is really annoying and I'm pretty sure this wasn't an issue with the old design."
Constanly have to uninstall. Won't play downloaded podcasts unless online. Frequently have to redownload favouite songs. Poorly written app for such a huge platform. Spend more time and money on writing a better program.
"Recently the user experience have been TREMENDOUSLY POOR! I can't do a simple activity: listen to my liked songs! The app frequently shows the message ""Your liked songs will appear here"". Very sad 😭"
This app is becoming worse than ever man . I used to get one ad after 3 songs . But these days it like I play one song and I get two ads. It's better that you all take it seriously and work on it. Another issue is the loading UI.
"Had many issues with spotify free and paid versions. Spotify free had glitches/(intentionally placed that many ads) in which it played 30 secs ads every 3 songs or so. It was bloody irritating that it was quite a negative experience for me. I liked the recommeded list for me initially, the thumbnail was well designed and i liked the tracks in it more or less.. So when i started the paid version, i expected no nonsense and was very much dissapointed. there was sO LITTLE features we could use.."
The app is good but I got 5 ads after playing 3 songs. All are unskipable ads. Really ruins the mood. 1 or 2 ads can be tolerated after 20mins. Really bad experience
"I've been using this app for a while but I can't afford to get premium. But whenever I press the ""watch now"" button for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music it does not work all the time and is irritating."
"Podcasts now have ads after paying for subscription. Videos on some videos are very glitchy despite perfect available bandwidth. Worst of all, after the 1st ad of each podcast, the podcast resumes from the very beginning, leaving you to return to the device to find where you were listening before the ad interrupted during your paid for subscription service. Be warned, the app has had additional ads included before ensuring continuity of service and bugs not addressed for months."
Good app and I'm a premium customer but there are some pretty basic features which it seems Spotify are unable to address. The shuffle is total rubbish and if you have a large playlist it keeps playing a small selection again and again so you miss out on most of the playlist. If you follow the not so straightforward guidance that appears all over the internet as it is such a rubbish feature it works for a short period then defaults back. Stop default shuff
I have been using spotify since a year (quite good experience though) but now it literally seems quite boring.That same UI/UX No major updates ; and irritating ads all time. Should do something about it.
"Was using premium till now so didn't know this problem, The app is literally unusable for non premium users... I can't play songs which I want without shuffle (it used to work before).. Just use another app if you're not interested in paying... If you're paying, then it's a good app... Just 1 day without premium ruined the whole experience for me"
"Slow, weird freezes, requires internet to play downloaded content sometimes for absolutely no reason. App was great about a year ago and has gone downhill since."
"I like the app but they put very loud ads in between songs and they alternate it with quite ads in order to make you anxious and get you to the point to pay for subscription!! This is a filthy way of manipulation !! I don't pay for it and do bear the ads, which is fair but making it even more annoying in a subtle way and on purpose is a shame !! :("
Atrocious. It's been fine for ages. Whatever happened in the last few weeks ruined my experience. If my phone is active it's fine. If it's not active the music stops.
I'm not sure what happened in the last couple of weeks but I somehow cannot find where to shuffle a playlist anywhere in the app anymore. It used to be a button that was obvious but now I don't know how to shuffle from anywhere. I even double checked to make sure my account was changed from premium but it wasn't.
"Always a weird issue. Last month it wasn't aware what it was playing and I couldn't stop music. Now pressing the phone's volume button pauses the music? (No, I won't ""upvote"" an issue on your forums, I'll look for alternatives instead, that's not a free service, users shouldn't beg for fixes.)"
"Bugs. Downloaded music requires internet to play. Problem while opening the app, it just gets bugged frequently. And no its not my phone. I am a premium member but not for long i guess."
"Hey, what happened? I search for specific songs and when I click on the results, I am led to a playlist of songs that had the cover I was looking for but the songs are the ones that I didn't even look up. I can only see the shuffle button instead of the button that plays the music I searched for."
Stops playing randomly. Will not resume playing after fast forwarding past advertisements unless you fully quit and re-open the app. Generally glitchy and unstable. Stop adding features and just make it work correctly
"Ive had spotify for a long time but it has been getting worse in the past 6 months. The app will randomly quit, songs will stop playing if you exit the app or lock the phone. The app wants to show me 7+ ads every 2 songs. Sometimes the ""30 minute ad free"" feature doest even work and shows you even more ads. Have not had these problems on my iPad but the phone definitely needs a major patch to fix its issues."
"Spotify premium is ok for streaming music, not great but ok. The recent changes to the UI made it clunky but not unusable. For podcasts look elsewhere, even the premium ""paid for"" service has adverts. Not ""ads recorded into the podcast by the creator"" but standalone ads by spotify that can't be skipped. Ads by the creator I'm fine with, ads enforced by the service provider when you pay a subscription for an ad-free experience I'm not fine with. Voted with my wallet, cancelled sub, deleted app."
"Its okay until you find out THAT TO DO ALMOST ANYTHING YOU NEED PREMIUM!!!! Like other reviews here have stated that spotify used to be great, but progressivly has gotten WORSE!! I cant even skip a few songs without having to get premium. I get the ads, the ads dont bother me but I cant even listen to a song that i want to listen too because ill need premuim. This is insane."
"The organisation of the library is really bad now with the check boxes instead of the pages. The podcasts don't list by recently updated, the playlists aren't ordered the way you'd want most of the time and the follows and artists get messy. The pinning has too few choices. Sigh the UI is not improving either."
"I absolutely love Spotify but the latest widget update sort of lets me down. The album covers, names and titles became smaller so there's much more space than there used to be. But in favor of what? It doesn't look nicer or neater, only cruder. That plenty of space could be used for a like button or seeing other songs in a playlist, which would be minor but really convenient impovements, or other bells and whistles. Spotify seems to be the best streaming service the market has to offer, yet it has to keep up with Yandex Music that provides the possibility to listen to podcasts (which has been promised to be done since Spotify's release here in Russia) and read the lyrics (so far there's only Genius Behind The Lyrics in Spotify, which is something at least but definitely not the thing). Anyways, I have faith in Spotify team, I believe that developers can read it now and will keep doing their job in fixing all the drawbacks! Live Long and Prosper 🖖"
"Love spotify but hating the app lately. Keeps being buggy. I'd put on a song and it would still show the name and cover of a different song. Pause button refuses to work half of the time. Suddenly quits. I have a Samsung s10 and all updated, so it shouldn't cause as much problems as it is. Sad because I loved this app."
"Great for premium users, terrible for free users. I use Spotify free, and that implies ads. However, the ""30 minutes of ad free music"" ad follows another 10 minutes of ads, also stated by another user in reviews. So either that 30 minutes of ad free music is after the other 10 minutes of ads or (as implied) should be after the 1 ad following my click of watching the ad. This is incredibly annoying and completely ruins the user experience. Spotify fix this, or just do 30 sec ads every song."
"It's slipping downhill from great height. Of course Spotify has a great catalogue but issues with chromecast and connectivity are ruining my experience with it and I'm genuinely looking at an alternate app. Cannot stream via chromecast to speakers because randomly the song will stop halfway. This is a known fault that they cannot fix, been reported well over a year now. Secondly, even with full signal 4g it can take forever for the app to start playing a song or podcast. Such a pity."
Everything is good about this app but the worst thing about this is ads are shown more frequent than any other app. After every song ads are shown which ruin all the mood. This need to be fixed.....
Spotify refuses to load my downloaded music and podcasts while in in offline mode. Seems a little counter intuitive if you ask me. I download these to listen to while offline or without service but they won't load after being downloaded.
"Every single upgrade gets the ui worse. I guess the ui designers have not used android auto version either, ever. Will hit ""safety pause"" before reaching daily mixes in android auto and those damn small pics of band members does not tell what type of music the mix is. It won't even start playing after clicking the mix. Also back button goes back to top and safety pause before reaching mixes again 😬 Why on earth it is not possible to disable podcasts?"
Recently the app has become very slow and laggy. I want to have quick access to my music and sometimes this is impossible with this app. Sort it out Spotify.
"App is fine and might be the best music app around. Unfortunately it's not that great for free user. The ad is way too long and really aggressive + interrupt so much. Basic music player features like skipping music requires subscription. Don't get me wrong, i love this App, but joox is more usable for a free user like me."
"Really dissapointed as of recently. -Liked songs keep dissapearing, inconsistent with ios, windows, mac counterpart (also poor sync). -Horrible ui that has not been updated in years (you can't swipe up or down the music, can't even quick swipe to search songs in liked [its two steps in android], the background colors arent even correct to the album in full screen. -The music, streaming is alright. Really behind in terms of everything. I hope they do something about this."
Update bad I am trying to find a button to play my playlist but no i can only edit it its so messed up now i got to spend more time on a different app and look for songs. before spotify was really good to listen too.
"Great song and podcast selection as always, but lots of recent bugs: (1) incorrect file being shown as currently playing, (2) frequent crashing/song stopping (3) play/pause button is ineffective - often unable to pause or resume playing a file. Almost useless in current state."
"New update ruins the library, makes it harder to use and find music you listen to. App us very buggy often getting stuck in loading loops or not playing songs."
"I have been using spotify for podcasts and I gotta say, there are much better podcatchers out there then spotify, I am not a big fan of the smart UI and algorithms as I like to find old episodes I have been listening to and nothing is static, when you leave a page and go back nothing is the same, its kind of frustrating and it randomly pauses my podcasts and yes they are downloaded, and there are lots of other minor quirks that I could complain about, still lots of work to do."
"Scenario: casting to Sonos One, locking phone and then unlocking. The UI no longer knows the music is playing on the Sonos. Really obvious and bad bug that has been on the app for at least a year"
"Within the last 7 years of use the app has lost quite a bit of function, the app is buggy and some premium features fail to operate. For long term users it's looking a lot like an alternative will be the next step for there is no technical support."
"As a person with more than 20 playlists created and lots of albums saved the new design is AWFUL, not to mention half of the time it takes a restart or a lot of time to work. Having no quick button to search songs in a playlist (going to the three dots and scrolling down is a lot more work than the quick bar that was there before). Please try to listen to the users, we want simplier apps, not this."
Terrible for podcasts. Its a mess. So annoying some of my favs are spotify only. How come the played/unplayed button doesn't stay on so you can more easily find what you haven't listened to yet. Please fix!
"The free version leaves plenty to be desired, and i understand thats why they have the premium version. They offer a 90 day trial but they require a credit card on file, why? If it was really free you wouldnt have to give them anything, just shut it off when the trials over and if its worth it, ill renew. Everyone gets away with it theese days, im not taking the bait, no thanks."
"Too much effort spent building new features, not enough spent fixing bugs. The latest update has broken Google Cast features for me. Titles provided to cars over A2DP Bluetooth have been broken for months and months. Community forum posts about these issues are largely ignored, and just full of people repeating the issue, no one actually solving it."
"The music selection is great, but it is hampered by a interface that with every update gets more cluttered. I would love to see an option to disable the clutter. No more accidental removing a song from liked with the heart button in the liked playlist, optionally showing the filters in my library rather than forcing it. Edit: new update, slightly more cluttered and less sensory friendly. Tut tut tut."
"Pay premium, get extra ads in podcasts, utterly ridiculous. App is super glitchy playing downloaded content offline and isn't very intuitive. Good selection of content."
"Best UI Worst Experience. The app has the best user interface of all the apps I have used. However, seriously the amount of ads you guys put in is irritating as hell. I opened the app played one song then 2 ads...then one more song and then two ads..wth..do you really believe ppl will subscribe to your premium after you give them such third grade experience. I understand you have to make money but at what cost..make the app a paid one upfront..no subscription"
"If you are going to be pushing podcasts for Spotify (especially exclusive streaming of some of the most popular ones), please creat a Podcast streaming UX that supports habitual listening of shows we follow! Some main features that should be implemented are auto-download of new episodes, segmentation of podcasts to their own tab/menu on the app to make accessing easier, reduce the reptetive and excess information of the podcast library (the names are on the cover art of each podcast), etc..."
"One issue remains after two years: with ""gapless"" playback, tracks without silence at the beginning or end still have a gap between them, and a single track in repeat does the same. // With the latest update you removed using the custom library order that can be set in your software in other platforms (in my case Windows). // EDIT: I was wrong on the last one, it's still there if you select only playlists. Of course I did not realize because they keep MESSING AROUND WITH THE UI, please stop!"
Spotify develops problems quite regularly and finding help to sort them is an absolute chore. You should have a phone service rather than the almost impossible to use online help. You make enough money out of us to do this service properly.
"I don't like the homepage look/design at all. Its really not efficient. I liked scrolling sideways to see my recently played albums/playlist/songs. Now that's gone. I also liked the way they would recommend songs or albums, artists that I like. Now it's just a long list scrolling down with only one option per category. Really not practical."
"I'm genuinely curious why every six months this app is redesigned to be 10% more difficult to use and introduce more bugs. Can I just set the default view not to be every single album and playlist in my library? I've made playlists for a reason, make them easy to access again."
The app does not play anything now...! I click on play button and no audio no streaming what so ever. Kindly check and fix it. I have restarted my device changed internet connections and yet not working.
The last few updates has been so buggy that it wants me to reconsider using Spotify. There's a number of problem that keep on recurring : 1. Sometimes the song changes but the UI is stuck on the previous song. This happens way more often when I change songs using my Alexa device. 2. Some podcast episodes just dont play. They just don't want to start playing and stay stuck Iin 00:00 minutes. How am I supposed to listen to the episodes ! 3. Shows no internet when I have strong wifi connection.
"-3 stars for the new layout. The new UI stinks. The home screen is too bare now. It used to give you more choices on the recommendations. Now, it just wants to shove what everyone else is listening too in your face. I hope they fix this soon."
"Really bad about music continuing to play while casting, but app goes non-responsive. Works well enough but this isn't an acceptable feature."
"The app used to be intuitive and easy to use. Recent updates have the the app beyond frustrating to navigate. When searching through podcast episoded it now will continously switch the sorting order, for example it defaults to newest to oldest and i switch it to oldest to newest then while browsing it will revert back."
"Spotify is supposed to be a great app, no? Otherwise no one would use it. But it really isn't that good, and with the amount of ads you are better off using YouTube where you can at least skip some of the ads. The app is hard to navigate, unintuitive, and annoying, the Desktop app is better, but for now I'll go with youtube music, a way better app in terms of the interface."
"Disappointed as since the last update, if you hit the forward button or back button on your headphones, it used to skip backwards and forwards (10 secs etc). Now pressing it skips to the next episode. Why on earth would anyone do this for podcasts? This should be fixed to what it's been for years."
The app UI is very good it's very clean and with the dark mood it looks so much beautiful but ads are very annoying Spotify keeps playing 3ads after 1song is finished I listened more ads then a songs instead of using this I would recommend to use YouTube music they not have only less ads their songs recommendations are good
Terrible experience on searching and playing a favourite song. You need to do alot better . What's the purpose of clicking that green PLAY button and other things are the ones playing ?
"Since the last app update, I can't even properly start and pause a podcast. A podcast would randomly stop, it would loop back to the beginning of you try to start it again, and you have no idea how minutes of the listening have been done bc the time lapse indicator isn't working. It's like Spotify is trying to get rid of it users by letting its app have a worser user experience and trying to be more buggy and non-functional with every app update. Very interesting business strategy indeed."
"Used to be the best music app. Now they play a lot more ads and make you press a button sometimes if you want to skip what i call an ""ad intro"""
Keeps crashing takes for ever to load when closed and take for ever to recognise I have pressed a button to do something. Used to be the best music app full so now it's just pain and a chore to use.
Insanely buggy on bad connections. Far more so than it has any right to be. Struggles to play downloaded tracks or load UI elements.
Quite nice app from point of functionality but it contains a lot of ad and many restrictions for users without premium subscription (especially in mobile app). I think that subscription not costs my money.
"The app Is absolute garbage now. Go back to the chalkboard If you think I'm going to let you choose the order that my songs play. I loved my Playlists. I had them matched by vibe. Now I can't use this app. I hate it. WaNa brEaK fRoM ThE adS. If you are trying to make more money, ask EA for some more tips to ruin this app. I hate this with all of my soul. You get the extra star for the great customer support. Give those guys a raise for all the bs you put them through."
"Every update this app gets worse. You've ruined the 'Your Library' page, ruined the order of playlists. Stop adding and changing things that don't need to be altered."
"Dear Spotify you are a great music streaming platform. We understand you have to sell your premium plan, we are okay to listen to adds once in a while but adds telling us to take premium after every second song is just too irritating and it is making us want to quit using you"
"It was great, but I was being prevented from playing albums in order in which they were released not on shuffle. And since I have premium now it was supposed to have taken that problem away but instead it still doesn't let me turn shuffle off, I've even tried doing whut they say on tha website but there's no shuffle button for me to push. I'm on a Samsung note 20 Ultra 5g"
The best in term of music catalogue. Although it's amazing how much good music is missing. The worst in term of app design. It's clear the Devs programming this have never used their own app.
"With the last updates, the Android version of the app is becoming breakware. It (incorrectly) claims no internet connection, it (annoyingly) hides downloaded playlists if they're in a folder, and it's stopped showing cover art for new songs. Worst of all, they have *deleted* functionality from the 'Your Library' section, turning it into an unintuitive, overcomplicated mess that doesn't remember your preferences after you close the app. I am a Premium customer who is resesearching alternatives."
"Less than what I was hopeing for. 1. It wont allow me to actually play the song I want, just just show me a quick preview of the song 2. The shuffle feature is broken for playlists when you already have a song playing that is paused. It will just resume the song and not not shuffle. 3. Just hard to navigate."
"This app has been consistently bad for me. Have had to uninstall and reinstall many times. What is playing and what it shows it to be playing is different, the pause/play button often isn't responsive and audio just spontaneously stops. I'm super disappointed because i was really optimistic coming from Amazon music. Not much better."
"I do not like this app that much anymore, I love the songs but I do not like that I do not have the option of making the same song repeat with a button that was before and now when I skip songs I do not like that I have to pay for it. I loved how this app was before. Now even this has adds too. It would be better to use YouTube other then Spotify. This also plays songs that are not from the artist or show or movie that I requested for either!"
"Crashes way too often, constant internet connection issues even though I'm on wifi, updates aren't really focused on enhancing user experience, making it harder to sort musics and making a mess out of your library. Also, how is it possible that we still can't sort our own lines musics by genre? I'll never get that..."
"App desperately needs proper player functions. Podcasts no longer have a pause button! I literally have no way to stop it playing without force stopping the app. Seriously, this app is borked."
"Fix the main issue and it would be great on Galaxy devices! It always fail to show Artists specifically saying “something went wrong”. There's NO DOWNGRADE RIGHTS!: Taping the Artist name should only show the one I tapped instead of the first one... And, where is the “Artists” button after the update, give me back! very annoying. Don't just replace it with “show credits” Recommendation : add features like “unfinished ” pending Playlist so I won't miss a song after I've finished discovering more"
"At first, Yes I thought it was the thing I needed for myself, because of my K-pop heart, but then, It turned out that I can't undo my shuffle now it's all ruined Im sorry but I don't like it. You're trying to hard just for Someone to pay you for music. Its like the world, it keeps forcing you to buy the premium, And to many ads. Please don't be offended it's just that I had a good-bad experience on this app, thats all. YALL NEED TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO USE THIS APP"
"Internet connection on mobile data is extremely unreliable, whilst every other app requiring a connection works at the same time spotify won't. Search algorithm on the search bar is also very very bad."
"I have been a premium member for a long time, And this latest update has ruined the app :( the layout is a mess, can no longer sort podcasts by most recently updated, the 'new episodes' section is terrible if you follow a lot if podcasts, and podcasts and music all mixed up. Also having issues with the now playing graphics being stuck on 1 song, and app crashes or freezing which never used to happen The only way to fix it seems to be restarting my phone (on google pixel 5)."
Since the update it's been far slower and sometimes unresponsive loading up albums and moving around the UI. Far slower than any competitive service.
I don't have the canvas feature here and there's no shuffle button to begin with even if lots of other free accounts frm other parts of the world have it last but not least you should add a skip ad option after 10secs I mean you make us watch a 30sec long ad it's too much
Used to be 5 stars but now it's at a solid 2. The new update ruined it all. I can only skip 6 songs and it's way more ads than it was before. I don't even know how to work the app anymore.
"Are you guys going to fix it or what? The app worked fine previously but now it's barely functional as is. Quits playing in the middle of episodes all the time, then you go back and can't figure out where you were because it switched the episode. Like what a epic fail of an update."
"Was a good app until recent updates when they ruined the playlists tab, also have this weird bug now that makes it so Spotify stops playing every 2 hours or so when it feels like it, really annoying tbh"
"Cannot listen to podcasts anymore. App glitches, won't remember where I stopped playing, everytime I go to skip forwards or backwards it resets to the same time, cannot use the scrub bar, just broken. Kinda ruins my morning commute 😔 2 star because I can still listen to music fine."
Latest update is buggy. I'll be listening to one podcast but the UI shows that I'm listening to something else. Makes seeking a major pain. Also seems to stop playing randomly.
I love Spotify I subscribe every month. But lately the app has been WAAAYYYY too glitchy. Stops play back randomly. Doesn't play the selected song. Basically gonna quit paying for it if I can't use it the way I want.
"I would like to see when scrolling through songs the heart icon if I liked a particular song instead of needing to click at each song's three dots, which is located at the right of each song, to look if a song is already liked The play button is not working"
Everything has been fine for years. Now anytime I interact with the app there is a variety of bugs and glitches that make the user experience horrible.
"Having the same problems as everyone else after the recent update - app doesn't display correctly, sometimes songs and podcasts randomly stop, everything bugs out if I try to scroll too much in a podcast's episodes and sorting doesn't work. Force quitting the app temporarily fixes some of these problems, but it's overall become quite a bad experience."
"I thought it was my Samsung S20 5G early bugs that caused my issues with Spotify, but seeing the feedback here changed my mind. As of the last months the app freezes, play button does not change to pause, vise versa. The music player won't show up but music is playing. Songs or podcasts randomly pauses and you have to open app again and press play to continue, due to the music player not showing Paying premium for a product that does not work as intended, should be refunded or compensated."
"it worked great at first. now i get ads after every two songs. and i get kicked off my own playlists. i dont want premuim, 10 dollars so i dont hear ads. sounds stupid to me. this app is begging for money. very annoying"
Spotify seems to intentionally make their voice ads so cringe-worthy and irritating to encourage users to take paid subscriptions. An excellent strategy for business but an unethical & deceptive practice from a user experience perspective. Love the collection of music and flexibility to listen on all devices but this practice is a major red flag. Come up with another strategy soon. There are enough players in the market to consider uninstalling and never missing the app.
"The UI lacks key points that should make everyone's lives much easier: - You cannot see in what playlists a song already is in. - Apart from the playlists, you cannot organize your music, all you have is a huge list of saved albums and artists. - The queue should display the songs that you have already listened to in that queue. - You should be able to add a song to more than one playlist a a time. - In desktop they deleted the feature of being able to search in the list of playlist, when adding a song, to sort them, but added it in mobile a while back ??"
"This app has been getting worse and worse. Now the interface just locks up and freezes. I terminate the app and reopen and it's still frozen. Spotify, your team is messing around with the app too much. Make it stable and secure and then take your time with the updates. You're ruining your product. (Pixel 4a 5g)"
"Janky podcast UI with no ability to search for episodes, which sucks all the more for the advent of exclusive podcasts. Have fun scrolling through hundreds of episodes to find the one you wanted to listen to, only to jump back to the top of the list randomly. Current song display often breaks and never works in a car."
"Very buggy recently. Most frustratingly, it keeps losing track of playback; music plays but the playback time and control buttons get stuck. Also frequently stops playing for no reason."
I have a Galaxy F 62 device running on Android 11 One ui 3.1 on the top of it. After 24 hrs my offline music on app gets deleted automatically. I did everything to mitigate the issue like 1. Clearing the app from battery or storage optimizations. 2. Uninstalling and installing it again from Play store. But nothing seems to work. I think this problem is from your side. Please help.
"After the last update the app got super squirrely on my s21 ultra. Bluetooth connectivity issues, not pausing, continuing to play after Bluetooth disconnects. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone, updating all the other apps - nothing helps! It was great and super stable before."
The latest update has some definite issues. The screen doesn't match up with what is playing and it stops playing randomly which is quite annoying.
"The new update has just completely borked the app, I have limited internet connection where I work and rely heavily on downloads and the offline mode. Half of my playlists will error out or be unplayable after downloading and being turned offline and podcasts that were listed and worked the one day will suddenly all list June 1969 as if they didn't exist and become inaccessible until I'm able to go online again. The new redesign has also made the whole app incredibly slow with loading"
Very disappointing. I can not play songs from playlist when I click on a play button it plays a preview of song. But I can not play songs as per my choice from playlists. However working on pc and tv apps. Hope this is fixed soon. Region. Pakistan
"I can't log into my account, no matter how much I try, it shows my password is incorrect. And when i tap in the link button sent on my email - It shows the link has expired already within few moments. This has been happening for more than a month. Help! Edit - I had to approach their support. They told me my account was blocked due to no valid reason! I had to create a Whole NEW account, lost all my playlists and songs."
The user experience of the Spotify application has gone down drastically after the recent update. There are multiple bugs in the application. I have tried all the troubleshooting tips provided by Spotify but the problems still remain. Kindly fix the user experience problems ASAP in the next update.
"The current song progress bar is stuck on something that played the first time I opened the app and I have 5o restart my phone to refresh it. The ux just get messier with every update, making things harder to find. The discover playlist always play the same songs, and there is no way to keep the app from pushing me a few songs I hate no matter what I play."
"I want to preface this by saying I really enjoy using Spotify, but this most recent update has made Spotify UNBEARABLE. Constantly glitching! My 30 minute podcast is showing it's in minute 50. It's so broken. I constantly have to force quit the app so it can reconfigure. Please revert this most recent update!"
"Spotify is slowing down the whole system UI, especially when doing certain operations such as play/pause, changing track, etc. Android 10. Speaking as a totally n00b Android Developer, please forward the following word to your development team: ""DON'T BLOCK THE UI THREAD FFS!""."
"I loved Spotify, but since you did the whole library revamp, the app crashes a lot. Sometimes when I open ot, it starts playing the last thing it played and there's no stopping it or choosing something else. 2-3 restarts do the trick but almost makes me quit. Also, the player gets ""stuck"" with a song and keeps showing it, even if I'm 3 songs down and an entirely different playlist whatsoever (podcasts too). The UI isn't bad, but there's too much neon and bright on an otherwise dark app."
"Hate the new update. Always freezes, can no longer switch between music and podcast categories. Insists on sh***y playlists that auto-add podcast episodes. Also, now the skip-ahead button no longer works from the lock screen on my phone. Why even update it if you're just making it more clunky?"
Does what its supposed to Edited May 2021.... Doesn't do what it's supposed to... What's happened! Sleep timer no longer works and it has become so glitchy. Quite often the app gets stuck on a track and becomes impossible to navigate. I have reinstalled but to no joy ☹️
"i have spotify on my tablet and i can't see artist's profile. it always says, ""something went wrong, have another go?"" and everytime i press the try again button nothing would happen. my internet connection is stable and having no problem to play any songs. been tried to re-log in and it doesn't work, tried to reinstall and it works but only until i quit spotify once and go back again. it happens for months already."
"Can they just leave it alone? Premium user, maybe not for long. New library sucks. Cuz random is a good way to organize both artists and album titles. Bizarre to just hope the developers quit doing anything"
"Was good till they did the last update... Now it freezes and, randomly stops all the time. Forgets where you were in an podcast episode, shows you at the beginning when your at the end actually. When you want to stop or play the buttons do not respond when you touch them. Wish I could go back to the last version."
"2 stars cause it's a good app that I love but recently whatever I play just stops and there's no pause, play, go forward or backwards buttons on the notification tab.. I have to open the app and click play again.. I've had premium since I learned about the app years ago.. sadly not worth it anymore"
The newest updates are horrible! The buttons in the library are so small. How do you expect people to find those buttons from their car mount while driving. Someone could crash. Also the podcasts used to be sorted by new episode and now I have to swipe and swipe just to find the new episodes! CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!!!
"The latest update makes for a frustrating UX. Please stop combining artists, albums, songs and playlists in the Library tab..."
"Although spotify does offer a convenient way to listen to a wide music library, I have a few problems with it. Firstly, the offline mode doesn't launch unless you first have a wifi conenction, which is annoying. The app also crashes a lot, or straight up doesn't play music/respond to buttons to skip or pause songs. I have this problem not only on mobile but all platforms. Also spotify kinda scams musicians and doesn't pay them anything. I probably won't keep premium when my student account ends."
Facing lots of issues since recent update 🤦‍♂️.. Some different song is playing and something else its showing.. downloading already downloaded songs again and again... seriously guys.. it's full of bugs now.. !! Instant fix is required 🤨 Other people also facing same issues.. what the hell is going on... I'm a premium user.
Like the old design better. Since the update the Download Que is now Your Episodes. The Download Que used to only have episodes you download only and you can remove them when you're done. Now with Your Episodes it includes all episodes played. Too much clutter. Prefer the previous version before the update. Is there a way to get that version back?
"Was a great app but the latest updates are terrible. As many others have said, it is now difficult to find your own music and downloads and the search function is counterintuitive so it takes too long to find anything. New connectivity issues mean there is almost always a lag with loading the app and playing content. What happened??"
"I'm tired of the user experience of the app and I'm thanking of ending my subscription, I have a flagship phone and a high end SD card that I store my downloads on and it doesn't matter whether I'm online or offline the app takes forever to load, slow in response, slow to connect everything is really slow when using the app. I know the IOS app is way better and more responsive and actually have better UX in navigation and playback this Android app should be heading towards that direction."
"Music is great, app is terrible I love listening to what I want, but the app lags and crashes upon start up, and there's no way to turn off auto-updates for downloaded playlists. Internet is limited where I live, this is quite inconvenient. Content is good, some changes needed."
"Far too many ads in the app for how poorly it runs. It crashes on me every day or so. I use the app for podcasts alone, no music. Finding my episodes requires multiple clicks. Came here for Bill Simmons and Rogan. Honestly only staying for that content,unless I find alternatives. The new update makes it even harder to find my shows and episodes. And why exactly does it need an internet connection to play episodes I've already downloaded? Google podcasts was better and that's saying something."
"It's okay, but when ever the add where you press the button to get 30 minutes of no add music, i pressed it and in 1 song, an add will pop out of know where, PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!"
This new update is so bad. My app constantly crashes because my library is so big and with the new update it all tries to load at once. I just use youtube music now because Spotify never loads anymore. Way to ruin your app lol
"Every single update makes the app exceptionally worse. It used to be when I searched liked artists and downloads, results from my playlists showed up instantly. Now the menus are confusing and the app is slow as hell. The UI was wayyyy better in years past so why continue with pointless ""improvements""? If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
"Spotify is a great app for music and I've been on a family plan for years now but this new update is bad. Technically, the app has been failing since the update; I can't listen to anything downloaded if I haven't listened to it recently on Wi-Fi, so premium essentially pointless. And personally, I find the new library menu unintuitive and confusing; all mixed together. Having to scroll through whole podcast catalogues to find old episodes downloaded before the My Episodes feature. Revert it back"
"Terrible update. The UI is more difficult to navigate and load times have doubled, even for downloaded albums."
"Previously loved this app. Update 2 days ago had made it totally unresponsive. Restarted phone, reinstalled app... no go. At first could open app, then no buttons did anything. Now it won't even open. Works on my tablet, but on my Samsung Galaxy S10 it's dead."
"I have always wanted to join Spotify but it's just impossible to login. No matter what I try, change password, press the green button in emails, I just can not login. Plus I updated my details on your website. Still can't login. Frustrating"
"Spotify desperately needs to make a change in how they go about developing their UI for both their desktop and mobile programs. Over the last three years, they have made a habit out of taking one step forward while taking two steps back with each update they release. Looks are valued over functionality and performance. Each update brings decreased performance and the removal of valuable features. Please listen to your user-base, Spotify. Recent reviews are growing increasingly negative."
"The app is lagging big time on my phone. Thinking that it might be because I didn't have enough storage for it to funtion, but it was the same when I emptied my phone. Also, sometimes it behaves as if it wasn't online when I'm connected to the WiFi. All the other apps that I have work perfectly with my WiFi and data connection, except Spotify. It's been like this for months now and it's a quite annoying, specially because I'm paying monthly for this."
"Great service but only on Windows. On Android the playback pauses when other apps play any audio, which is at most annoying. The problem with this is that the app shuts down almost immediately after the music stops. It's not a problem from battery saving or whatever excuse developers are giving, it is a built-in bug that they are ignoring because they'll rather push features that no one asked for such as artists not related to the user's taste. Fix this because it is a PAID service after all!"
WAAAAAY SLOW LO........ ADING Not fun waiting 15 minutes for my library to load each time I get into Spotify. The recent updates have ruined Spotify. About to drop the service after years of no problem.
Was a good app now it is slow to load and buttons become unresponsive. I have also lost the ability to control it from my car stereo when connect by Bluetooth. Good music though
I have been charged my monthly fee for past six months yet forced to watch advertising. There is no way to talk to a person or file a claim with proof of payment. Your compartmentalize business structure is outstanding. I'll be going to I heart or some other scam service. You don't even have a submit button for this feedback. Epic thieves.
"I have used the app for many years and with the more recent updates it has become worse. It is now harder to find things you have downloaded, too many sub menus with ease of navigation gone out the window. It continues to try connecting to the Internet slowing the app down and making the music/ podcast skip a bit or stop playing for a few seconds. My last issue is that I'll play a playsuit and when skipping songs skips to another play list altogether. I am now looking for other options."
"Music gets exchangeable. Terrible UI, idiotic recommendations. Billion songs in gazillion playlists for cheap, ok. Fits in a world where artists 'drop songs' rather than albums, where the trend of today is forgotten tomorrow. Welcome to the new world."
Great for music but the last update has completely ruined the library feature making it more confusing to search for either music or podcasts as they are just lumped together please change it back
"Thank you, most recent update (10/5), for RUINING my personal order of playlists with your new filtering system on the mobile app. You could have added an ""old"" or ""personal"" option but no. Why assume people have a preference. That'd make them individuals and that just doesn't happen."
"Spotify is my primary music app, but please please PLEASE undo the most recent update. it has removed All Functionality of the saved music library and has completely ruined the experience of using the app. Undo it, and I think a lot of people will be much happier. Edit 5/9/2021: every update gets worse. Thanks i hate it"
I've been using Spotify for years and it used to be the best! But the new app layout is frustrating to find my downloaded podcasts - I'll pick a song and it'll shuffle two seconds later - the app glitches and kicks me out half the time. And seriously this new update sucks. If I'm not connected to WiFi it takes forever to load anything and it hides all my downloaded stuff in its li'l menu button. Probably gonna cancel my premium soon. Not a fan
"The default storage keeps switching from the SD card to the stupid internal storage. That means that I have to redownload many gigabytes worth of songs every once in a while, that wasn't the case a few weeks ago. The new UI is not very good either, please fix it!"
"Tha app was rather good, but last updates was just bad. Very bad. They just ruined the app. I suggest users to roll back to version 8.5.89.901. I suggest developers to take it seriously and notify users when the new version will be actually better then the old one."
"Please remember my sorting preferences. Who wants to see their oldest track first in a playlist? And also, a green button should confirm. It's confusing that it confirms to not add a track double."
I didnt feel like supporting Facebook Group of companies and moved to yt music its just as good same price ....it was stuffing up at first then i uninstalled spotify and its fine. Annoyingly spotify keeps asking me to sign back up. Sorry spotify if ive hit the cancel button im well aware of my decision.
I love spotify on desktop. But the Android app is sooo bad. I often don't have the patience to wait for the app to finally respond on my phone. I switched to Google Podcast to listen to podcasts. Free and much quicker. Spotify is my only paying app and it is also the worst. I keep hoping they will wake up one day as I love the platform.
The recent Spotify UI change is AWFULLY BAD. Previous UI was way better and it was very easy to navigate. I just don't understand why they're making their UI so BAD.
"The app finds music quickly, but is complicated, ads are popping up all the time, and it's way more complicated and confusing than l can tolerate l"
"I truly cannot believe this app gets worse before it ever gets better. I've been premium for YEARS. I use this app every day (what you want) but there's always some little bug that ruins the entire experience. Whatever Spotify Connections is doing is ruining the app. When Playstation gets Tidal, I'm done."
"I truly hate the new update. It has ruined my expiring with spotify. Mixing everything together with optional ""filters"" is such a pain, I prefer my playlists in my personal arranged order. Please go back."
Requires internet connection for a lot of functionality that should be local. Very slow. Why is swipe to queue missing? A feature the iOS app has had for years now.
"Spotify currently states ""No internet connection available"" as I type this review. Consistent UI updates that seem to be against convenience. 10 dollar subscription for an app that works half of the time."
"The newest update completely redesigned the ""my library"" section, and I absolutely hate it. I like having a custom order for my playlists, and alphabetical for artists, albums etc. each of them in their own tab, but now it is all jumbled together into a horrible mess, which cannot be organised properly. And I can only have 4 pins? If you make it look like a mess, at least give me more than 4 pins to keep important stuff at the top. Genuinely unnecessary and bad update"
I liked this app a lot for podcasts but now it is pretty annoying. Why does downloading a podcast add it to a playlist but deleting the file doesn't take it off the playlist? The UI is just annoying to use.
Hire some competent UI/UX designers please. So many things wrong with the new update that make using the app so much more difficult. It breaks fundementle design rules and doesn't even have the same functionality as previous versions. Considering a switch to a different service that listens to there customers...
"With a long list of requested features, Spotify has spent the last year not adding them, and just working towards making the UI the least user-friendly possible."
"Unstable App. Often Can't queue songs and when it can, queuing is too slow. Doesn't sync with my desktop Spotify. I could go on."
"They just updated it in an attempt to streamline use but just made it significantly worse... Downloaded content is quite hard to sperate now and the mixture between podcasts and music is a mess, they are different and should be separate"
"New UI makes podcast listening worse, especially browsing to downloads. Browsing TO the download. I cannot easily access a list of my downloads and it is BEYOND frustrating."
Last update on android makes me want to delete the app. Repetitive crashes and design not comfortable to use. Please fix it (perhaps disable last update) as soon as possible
"I hate it that you guys keep changing the UI, especially because I have adhd and autism. This is getting out of hand. I'm only using the app because I have no other choice!Just, stop changing the UI so often, for the love of all that's holy. my god."
"Terrible UI changes, playback issues, user input not being recognized, crashes... and it gets worse with every update. About to quit the service because the android app is awful."
"I love spotify, but the number of ads on the free version of the app is absolutely abhorrent. Please make your paid subscription cheaper, or genuinely provide the ""thirty minutes of ad free music"" that you so frequently advertise - many of your free users will be much happier."
"Podcasts now all shuffled in my library?? Since the recent update I have the option to filter my library by ""Podcasts & Shows"" but when I sort by most recent uploaded it's still shuffled. This is a horrible QoL downgrade, since I need to quickly browse podcast listing's before driving for work. Please keep podcasts and music separated as it is just a mess right now. Please fix."
"Am I the problem? Perhaps, I wouldn't be surprised, but here's the thing. I'm alright with being forced to listen to an album on shuffle. Sure. But don't tell me something is a specific album and not even have the right songs in it my dude. I came here for the nice design, but I am honestly feeling so attacked right now."
"It's really hard to simply play your fav song and they removed the loop button if you don't have Premium and when I play a playlist, it never played the actual playlist and instead plays random music that's not even in the playlist, Giving it a 2"
"Use to be a 5*, however I like many other premium users are not getting the quality we used to get even though we pay. On top of that I read where beginning June or July 2021 spotify would be going up in price for family premium, although not a huge increase. But, just wondering if it is worth me continuing to pay, just to have it stop playing every third song, or when it freezes then I have to either open my phone screen again or start the song all the way over, or skip to the next song."
"Works sometimes but often it takes FOR EVER to load (even after clearing data, cache etc) when searching for artists, again, takes for ever or just crashes or 'no internet connection' when there clearly is as I'm either browsing the internet or doing something else which requires internet connection. No it's not set to offline mode either. The app is just not very good, it's that simple. Have cancelled my sub now because if it and will just use bandcamp."
Pretty terrible experience. Doing something as basic as changing to next song causes the app to lag for half a second or so. I'm running this on a OnePlus 7pro so my phone is plenty capable. Layout pretty terrible and unintuitive. And the have a nerve to increase my subscription by 4 euro
"I do not have the fluidity to watch or listen to a podcast on different devices, I'm beginning to think that spotify cant create a good video platform. Its clunky on my phone, it often doesn't remember last listened points for a pod which can be very frustrating. SPOTIFY STEP UP YOUR GAME OR PEOPLE WILL JUST FIND ANOTHER WAY TO STREAM YOUR PRECIOUS VIDEOS"
"Insanely Irritating. This common glitch that they seem to be unable to fix where it pauses CONSTANTLY. I've had it pause 6+ times in a 2 minute song. I need to hover my finger over the pause button to hear a song through. I pay for premium too, I expect a service worthy of being called Premium."
"Spotify has stopped showing my currently playing song. It shows a song I play when I first launch the app, and gets stuck on it. For days afterwards it will still show that song, but when I use the buttons to play, pause, or skip, it does that to whatever it is I want to play. It's very annoying, am I the only one with this issue?"
"Rubbish. Sorting a playlist is very limited - Custom sort simply doesn't work, and there is no option to sort episodes by upload date. There is no sleep timer. There is no option to stop play after current episode. The whole app feels very ""beta"" and undeveloped. Only installed it to get a podcast not available on Podbean but it's a very poor user experience."
The new update ruined the app. I prefer to cast spotify to my devices. The app consistently is inaccurate and willnever show the correct song playing. Im so frustrated and not sure why Im paying for premium.
"Really bad bugs.. constantly disconnects, desyncs with Chromecast. Horrible quick menu options to close the app or disconnect from Chromecast. Lacks features in the desktop app."
Not a horrible app but often times it'll play songs from completely different bands when you want music from a specific band. Plus lately it has been playing random songs at random times which is quite annoying when I'm busy doing something else but I have to stop to pause the random song.
"Recent glitch where played music is not displayed on mobile. Uninstalling, clearing the cache, forcing stop, and logging out all proved fruitless. Troubleshooting on this application needs to be better."
"Whatever they updated ruined a bunch of functions. I can no longer control Spotify on my computer with my phone, when I first select a song it'll okay for a few seconds then it'll switch to a different song (shuffle I think). Please fix!!"
"Ads is required and that is fine.I felt like spotify ads are created to insult people. Their ads are like we are listening to ads coz we cant afford 10 rs. Spotify please understand there are many options for users. If you stop your own ads and play some other ads like many other apps do, would be better."
"Service is fine, but the app is awful. The way queueing works is unintuitive, as is toggling something as basic as shuffle. Offline mode is a buggy mess to the point that it is borderline unusable. Basically the app is a UX nightmare and the only reason I haven't gone to a competitor is because I'm on a family plan and can't justify the spend on a service I realistically already have access to."
App was working fine until last update. Now works okay if playing through phone but streaming via Google Chromecast renders the app interface on my phone to be almost useless .... no track progress is shown .. each played track does not update to the next track in the app. Spotify Community has a thread with 138 complaints raising this issue which has affected the Android app. Clearly a glitch. Hopefully Spotify can rectify quickly in another update. I will reassess my rating when this happens.
"This app is terrible but somehow it's the best optiyfor music. This app freezes literally every single song, I have to reset the app or it just shows the very first song I played with a stupid long time bar. Honestly this is the most popular streaming service for music, you think you could build a better App. Yeesh"
"Loved it at first. Left all my Playliss on pandora for Spotify. But this past year, with every update, there's more restrictions. I had a subscription and turned it off for a big since I don't commute as much anymore, but its horrible now when its free. Wasn't as much of a pain before. Pandora is offering free premium weekends now. Debating on switch back to pandora. Also my son uses my account because he's 5, and there's no way to distinguish that so I have random kids sings mixed into my songs"
"Recent update seems to have killed the app. I have constant difficulties connecting to devices, playback issues, and lag. Besides that I've noticed a recurring fault with the app, when selecting ""next"" button, the tab displaying song info disappears each time. Restarting the app does very little to fix this. Incredibly infuriating since I'm a Duo member and have been considering upgrading to a family account recently. Will definitely be holding off that decision until the app is stable again."
Evey time i hear a good song when I go to push my earpiece in out of habit it skips to the next songs and there is no way to go back. Yeah my earphones have some sort of button so not really Spotify's fault but no back button is pretty lame. If Swedish design is so awesome why is there no back button!!!
"Go online to see menu. The Spotify android app has many MANY issues. I see the above message 5-25 times every day. Instead of falling back to offline-only features, it shows that message and stops whatever I was doing. It doesn't matter if I am offline, or on a 500MBit/s wifi connection, it'll still refuse to show the menu. It also regularly forgets abuit half the spngs in my queue. If not for the good weekly suggestions I would have switched to a better service long ago."
"I must have had an update installed, because Spotify has all but quit working on my phone. It says that there is no internet connection. This is not true. I guess I will have to go back to I-heart radio. What a bummer."
"Really badly designed and unintuitive interface, access to listening queue and history is annoyingly difficult, playback on remote devices often doesn't work or playback just stops for no reason, entire library of music has to be periodically re-downloaded because who knows, Spotify just sucks and doesn't think you deserve to know why. Very close to 1 star."
"Queue button is missing from the app. I'm adding songs to queue, they are playing, but I cannot see, nor edit the queue, since the queue button just disappeared..."
"Ive been an avid spotify user for years. But as of this year I've genuinley considered taking my money elsewear. Half the time the app doesnt even work. When Im on wifi theres a 5-6 second delay between opening albums and the album actually loading in. And the second I go off wifi, the app craps itself. It wont let me listen to anything cause quote ""I don't have wifi"" even though I downloaded it beforehand. Fix your goddamn service spotify."
"The update hasn't changed anything - well, at least I can listen to the stupid ads on free Spotify now. I actually used to love spotify pretty much but it doesn't work on my phone (Android/ Umui 9 - honor 9) anymore - since months! I already reinstalled the app but it still doesn't work! It works my iPad totally fine. I just don't get it"
"I love spotify, been using it for years and years, and I am happy with the service, I am extremely unhappy with both the desktop and the phone app, they are very buggy, sometimes songs wont skip, or it will show a different song to what it is, sometimes it just doesnt play the song, and recently cannot control music on desktop app from phone very well, shows different song, the minutes carry on as if the song never ended. Pls fix this it is annoying to pay 10 quid a month for the inconvenience"
"Gets stuck all the time, albums wont load. Songs keep ""playing"" i.e. the timer keeps going up of the song when it's long finished already, artists won't load, despite solid connection, good harware and restarts. I like the whole UX a lot, but the crashes and bugs are just so frustrating and regularly make me want to oull out my hair."
"Great audio, easy to use, great selection BUT if you don't have premium it does this thing, let's say I'm listening to my liked songs, out of nowhere it will FORCE me to listen to some trash song by Hairy Styles or Justin Bieber? It's always these two, and honestly this ruins the app in my opinion. Beginning to think Pandora is better."
"My premium subsricption will end up til November 2021, how come selected music on my downloaded song particularly all my liked songs can't play on my phone. This issue only happen this March 2021. Add to that, why i can't click the liked button on the songs i selected. Hope you can fix this and I'm hoping for consideration and fixation on this matter. Thank you..."
"landscape mode was removed, random connection issues (music is greyed out until spotify is reset) yet i have full reception, annoying prompt for car navigation every time i turn the phone screen on while connected to blutooth earbuds or speaker, home screen spammed with pod casts and comedy channels that i have never listened to nor do i like, offline mode only works sometimes, unlinked facebook account but profile picture is still from facebook so not unlinked i guess, cancel account requires contacting spotify support team and asking if it OK to close the account. sign up and take your money in 10 seconds but have to contact support and get sent in a circle to close the account, that is very dodgy !!! i have used spotify for 10 years and i think it is worse that what it used to be"
"Pixel 4a, for the last month the music playing won't update as I'm skipping through songs, 2nd the play and pause buttons don't work anymore either and constantly crashes. Fix!!"
"It hangs, stops playing for a few secs, when streaming to my home nest some random songs are way too quiet, playing queue disappeared , now I stopped subscription . Also I can't find play radio button based on a song or playlist , though I am now on a free plan and maybe that' why ( just checked , on Mac I still have queue , go to a song radio, so the update in android ruined things)"
The latest Spotify update has stopped working in the car properly; I can no longer change songs in the HUD on the dash and the screen requires Spotify to be closed and reopened. Please address said bugs
"This app was working great with a bluetooth headset. Now, for the last few weeks the songs play for about 20 seconds ant then stop. I don't know if it to do with playing when the screen switches off or not but when I press the on off button it plays again. Very annoying"
"The music selection is decent, but be prepared to wonder ""why would anyone Ever do that?"" literally every single time the app gets updated. And their feedback system is designed to silence anyone who disagrees."
"I was evaluating if I take the plunge and pay for premium, my god do the advertisements to pay for premium are borderline insulting, it was very uncomfortable. I ended up purchasing Amazon music at the end. I found the advertisements in India to be rather belittling, condescending and rude. Sure people will pay but do you need to act as if your potential customers are cheap hobos?? Edit: there is no easy way to access an yearly plan, I don't want to go for daily plans, the UI takes no prisoners"
"What is the deal with the same freaking advert after EVERY other song? I'm broke, emotionally distressed, living just on this side if suicide and I use music to cope and every since Google Music died and went to YouTube bs, which is worse bty, this is my only real option but Jesus Christ, AFTER EVERY OTHER SONG FOR HEALTHCARE THAT'S NOT EVEN AN OPTION WHERE I LIVE? REALLY? just when I start to feel better I'm bombarded with a very LOUD annoying ad. I can't afford ti hardly eat. Sad but true."
"Why does this stupid app play ads after every song??? How irritating. I mean, no, I'm never gonna have Premium, no matter how hard you try to convince me. So ultimately those are useless. Not only useless but also irrelevant and disturbing. Stop all these nuisances, Team Spotify. It's actually futile."
"Can barely go one song without it crashing (music stopping & when I go back to turn it back on the song doesn't even save where I was before) & also lags a lot. I love to listen while I play roblox & the crashing crashes roblox too Also I think there should be a 'not interested' button cuz sometimes piggy piano covers come on & i don't like to listen to it anymore. Btw, stop advertising the same ads all the time (I already have teams so stfu)"
"hit and miss UX. great selection and performance but don't expect beyond very limited music meta data support ( credits, lyrics, album art )."
"Solid music and podcast selection, but app plagued with bugs. The recent update *completely* breaks android auto and all vehicle controls for my oneplus 7t (not sure if similar issues happen on other devices). The UI will hide elements when the car suggestion box comes up, and the app won't completely delete music after unchecking the download tick. These sorts of bugs shouldn't make it into a stable release, let alone for multiple updates."
"An otherwise great app ruined by greediness. I should not be getting ""sponsored recommendations"" in an app where I pay to get rid of all ads and get the best experience they can deliver."
"Up until about January, the app was working fine. After that it started switching between songs and not playing anything. Now since a few days, the songs don't look the same anymore and there is no repeat button. The picture is gone too and overall it just looks bad and doesn't work anymore. Please fix this!"
"It's gone downhill. I used to play spotify all the time. But now it's like, play 2 songs and have 3 ads then another 2 songs then more ads. Why the influx of ads all of a sudden?"
"Frequently stops music for unknown reason. Favourite button and search functions randomly stops working, restarting the app or reinstall often fails. I have a pixel 4xl with strong WiFi connection, also happens to other devices... All the time. Am having to download every playlist that I listen to. Very annoying."
"I like the fact they allow you to play songs whrn u are not in the app. But i really hate it when they just add songs to your playlist that you dont want and you cant get rid of it. It ruins the experience for me. I only want to listen to the songs i want, not the songs they added into my playlist. They should add an option where you allow them to suggest songs to you with your permission. Please fix this."
everything was working fine untill about this month when songs just suddenly stop. The pause button isnt actjvated so you need to then pause and unpause the song again and hope it only happens once. sometimes it will happen several times in a row. not impressed considering I pay for this service.... of it keeps happening much longer I will be seriously considering pausing my subscription and defecting to google music.
I really love this app but i have been facing an issue since the day i downloaded the app (august 2020). The music bar disappears randomly when I'm not using the app. I contacted the support but they couldn't resolve it. This really ruined it for me. I wish this could've been fixed because spotify is really the best streaming app.
"Keeps crashing, and won't play episodes of podcasts even after I've downloaded them. Was hoping maybe the premium version might be better but I can't try it cuz they can't verify my school, (they advertise that students can get premium free) Also not a fan of how once a show is exclusive to their platform, they will go and make content they deem problematic inaccessible (see Last podcasts on they lefts early episodes on suicide or various joe rogan episodes)"
"Used to work well without issues, now since a good while it randomly stops the sound but the track seems to keep playing (on the same device), sound stutters, screen doesn't load every time, buttons don't work.. it's more of a pain in the butt to try and listen to a podcast or music!"
"I can't even close my screen or else it will slow the music, it'll do it with the screen open sometimes too. Really ruins the musical experience"
Would surely give more and I used to like it when using it in a different country (Nz). But from the time I've relocated to India there ads after every 2 songs. Most of the ads are to go on premium. Just frustrating. Did loose one of my podcasts and haven't been able to find it since. The mobile app is not so intuitive as the webplayer. Excessive ads!!!!
"The Email Issue is Confusing. I have an account that I made with only a username. I now cannot log into spotify on any other device, and due to the email button in the settings not working, I cannot listen to it anywhere. I have payed for premium and I will be getting a refund if I cannot link my email to my spotify account. Please fix the button."
"Why is this the monopoly? frankly, its catalog is limited, its app is sub-par (still that issue of clogging up cache to be manually cleared). someone got me premium, so I use it. but it's had years to improve and it hasn't in a noticeable way. this is a worse solution that YouTube with the screen off. the player banner is useful, the design is slick, the audio and streaming is seamless, the ""add to queue"" button is crucial and the playlists are functional. now fix the rest"
"I've been using this app for months now and was quite satisfied until , it STOPPED playing music...whenever I play a song, the notification shows up but the progress bar doesn't move at all...I tried reinstalling this app, cleared cache and even logged in the same device from different account but nothing seemed to work...it has become very annoying now. I am sure there's a issue with the app....PLS FIX IT ASAP!"
Quality has been steadily going down for the past 2 years. The very agressive push for more podcast is a pain since it forces you to scroll down to see your music (ironic in a music app). Worst part is that it's a terrible user experience to listen to podcast with this app. Check Podcast Addict which is much better for podcasts. Recently they started asking for a good review so i'm editing mine to remove a star just for asking for a review.
Honest Garbage. I hate how everything that makes this app bearable is hidden by a premium version. I hate trying to listen to Playlists because of shuffle and the fact it doesn't allow you to skip more than 6 times an hour and the shuffle playes songs that aren't even on my playlists so I can't do anything. Sellouts. 2 stars because the music but not the app. They ruined Spotify and its so dumb. Either get rid of shuffle and let us listen to OUR music or don't make an app.
I dont like the service at all... Im trying to enjoy some good music and the app at first was great until it ruined it by making me forced to listen to music only on shuffle. So basically i can't individually play my favorite music and neither can i do ANYTHING about it. Not to mention it crashes too often and gets too buggy that i have to shut the app down on my device
It's a nice app i have used it a couple days but now i am haging one issue..it doesn't show the whole tracks of the album as in list it shuffles the songs of artist and i am unable to play the wgole album in a go and i don't know how to solve it.can someone guide me?
"Loved the app until latest update music stops for no reason, display freezes on 1 song info while continuing to play songs queued. Only way to fix is force stop the app and start over! Fix!!!!"
Pay creatives more for their art. Make equitable renumeration a standard #broken record. also really annoying that premium still defaults to shuffle play and pushes you away from the album/artist you're listening to.
"Used Spotify for many years and for the most part it's great besides some frustrating oversights and constraints on the mobile version that aren't apparent on the desktop equivalent. However, recently the app refuses to run in the background when my phones locked. I've messed around with app permissions, battery usage permissions with little success, I'm not sure if it's a bug with a recent update but it really sucks the literal life out of my battery playing music with mh phone screen always on"
"First problem: sometimes when I play a playlist occur ""next songs"" are always the same, like a loop of 6-7 songs moreless Second problem: we should have a ""i don't like"" button 3th problem: when I play one of my playlist why can't I remove one song from the playlist using the ""3 points"" in the top right? I think we deserve a ""remove song from this playlist"" button I hope you can improve the app with these tips."
"Spotify claims they're constantly updating and fixing bugs which I'm sure is half true but it seems like every new update comes with a new bug. Last update was the app freezing and the music continuing and nothing would fix it except for a force stop (which still isn't fixed btw) and now half the time the album covers aren't loading, I guess that's this month's bug. The long short of it is, Spotify has a great library but a terrible UI."
"Recent App Issues. The music keeps stopping for no reason, wifi is fine etc. Also the track is not updating as I am playing music and moving when I change song. Started happening in the last 2 weeks. Have updated the app, reinstalled, restarted phone. Getting very annoying and ruining a previous smooth experience."
"If the 14 day trial was supposed to get me to like this app, it failed. The audio stream has artifacts that ruin the listening experience. If not for that I would have happily subscribed. As it is, I deleted the app and went back to Pandora."
"I used to love this app. However, resently I am having major issues with music constantly turning off. When I look at the screen, it is asking for me to press button and commercial begins. Literally every 1 to 2 songs it stops."
"Updating, but leaving at a 2 because bugs have subsided, but the main play button is ALWAYS shuffle, and whatever A/B tester/UX designer/executive that designed that should feel bad."
"The music is great, but the ads suck, they play after the ad stops. There is no way of continuing the music when a 15 second ad plays for 3 minutes of silence"
"Okay,I have been using this app for years but the ads are heavily increasing. I'm a free user and the ads are starting to annoy me so,so much. I understand that you need to make money but why add more ads? I get ads after 2-3 songs and it's the WORST. The music has great quality but the ads just ruin the overall experience of using this app."
"Can't find an alarm function and I created a playlist and they added random song and when I delete them they add other random songs. Also it takes 2GB+ without any downloaded songs. And while I am listening to quite music it smashes an loud add about the ballermann hits in. Now with Premium it is a bit better, but pls make also contracts with artist directly. Only give my money to artists I listened to and also pay people for podcasts."
"Used to be great. New update sucks. Cannot select a song. There is only ""shuffle"" button. Cannot even fast forward a song."
"After switching over to Spotify because of a podcast I follow, I hate to report that Spotify quite messy. Why am I getting ads on a podcast as a premium user? Why when I'm using a downloaded podcast does Spotify decide to look for a connection and stop playback? I end up jumping through hoops to get my podcast back up and running. I'm on the road all the time and it's very inconvenient. So far, I'm not terribly impressed with the experience. Here's hoping they fix their bugs with coming updates"
"Been with Spotify from the beginning and they've ruined the app in the past couple months. Constant freezing, playing content won't update, songs stop after a few seconds. The only fix is to clear all the app data and log back in. Major issues in this app that need to be fixed."
I use Spotify mainly for listening to podcasts. The most recent update no longer allows me to view and listen to the episodes I downloaded from different shows in the order I downloaded them. Instead forcing me to go into each show and find the individual episode that I downloaded. Why make changes if you're only going to make the user experience worse?
The usability and design everything is good except for some really annoying issues which would make it more negative than its positive reviews. 2 stars because of the issue (songs randomly you never knew of stary playing automatically and when you stop and play a song of your choice in playlist or not it after some seconds stops the song and starts doing the same thing again). I would really love this app if this issue gets fixed.
"Thank you spotify, I now prefer to go and download my songs and hear them offline, just because of your too much ad policy like after every 2 songs, 4 ads, are you kidding me? This is seriously very bad. Great app ruined by so many ads. Atleast try to reduce their duration, otherwise everybody will shift back to offline downloads."
"Countless app issues. Randomly signs me out while in offline mode, requiring a restart of the app just to sign in (at least once per day). Menus take long (sometime several minutes) to load at certain times, but will load instantly at other times. Songs I've downloaded for offline use get deleted randomly."
"The library is like everyone else's... Aside from that the app is unintuitive and glitchy. If it wasn't for Rogan I wouldn't be using Spotify, it's that annoying."
"I love this app, infact this is the best Music application on playstore for me! But the ads are REALLY ANNOYING, Spotify literally begs you to burly the premium version of their app. It's more like the ads are designed to irritate the people who aren't buying premium. I cnat stand the new ads.... Hope y'all improve!"
"Good app for listening to music. Would give 5 stars if you didn't give me three ads when I haven't even listened for ten minutes. Spotify does not give you 30 minutes free music. I literally only listen to ads at this point! Update: It's even worse after I got a free trial for premium, now I am lucky if I even get three songs in without there being 3 more ads in a row. I was hoping to get premuim in the future when I am older but probably not now."
"UI experience makes no sense. Really? There's no quick way to do a search, you have to click through several menus to get there. You guys hire all of these devs and nothing gets done. It's frankly hilarious. iOS version has this."
"Spotify is a great service but this app is a buggy piece of garbage. The cast integration is a mess, I have to use the native casting for my phone or risk constant disconnects. Podcasts sometimes don't play. The app closes out of nowhere despite my phone having 8GB of RAM. Spotify has had years to build a stable and feature rich Android app. This, however, is a joke. The dev team should be ashamed of themselves."
"I love spotify but this app has become so terrible. My phone reboots every night on a schedule, and even after that if I open spotify after a long while nothing plays. It's so slow. I have to force quit it to get it to work. Cleared app data, same behavior."
"Spotify's Android app is super slow. It can take minutes for artist pages and albums to load. Highly inconvenient for hopping into the car to run errands and listening to some music or podcasts. If it wasn't for the subscription price, ubiquity of their service across platforms and their expansive library, I'd jump ship. If you have an option to, I'd recommend trying a different service before paying Spotify."
"I wish I would have used a different music streaming service. The premium duo membership is a genuine pain, really difficult to navigate their membership options and you have virtually no control over your music content when it comes to designing playlists. Poorly designed."
"I can't listen to a playlist in order, I always have to shuffle it. To me, certain songs go with certain songs so when that order gets jumbled, it's a terrible experience. Please fix this or tell me if I'm overlooking the correct button."
"Having some issues since the last update. My music keeps stopping randomly when I'm trying to listen via headphones, wired headphones or Bluetooth in the car. I hope it's a quick fix, because I don't want to swap my music to another app all over again."
"Loved the app until this new update. I like to listen to stand up comedy and now I can't listen to them in order but only on shuffle which ruins the whole flow, as well as all the albums being mixed together or others being removed completely now."
"Theres no point in downloading music because whenever I open the app, it needs to re-download the music again. Another problem is that whenever I switch to offline mode and open the app afterwards, it requires me to login because I am ""offline"". So retarded. I then connect back to the internet and it still doesn't work. I have to re-install the app for it to work. The only reason I haven't uninstalled and forgot about this app is because of how long I've had my premium subscription."
"App can be very slow to repond, show a loadscreen for minutes and worst of all, accumulates stored data, filling up memory which can only be removed by clearing it from the app manager. Shouldn't that be temporary memory? This is a streaming app... One more: the shuffle button doesn't work"
Premium subscription owner for years. Since recent updates with just quit playing while listening. All items have been allowed for background playing. Now with recent update the active song doesn't match with what's actually playing. Very disappointed considering this is a service i party for on a monthly basis. Instead of getting better its getting worse.
Don't know what happened but the app has to be Forced stopped to start working again after using it via Bluetooth or Android Auto. Seems to fail to work quite a bit. Paying for a premium subscription seems half pointless for a product I have to restart constantly. Hoping the update fixes it. Will update my rating after.
"Recently when I click an album, it doesn't show the songs in the album. Thus, I can't play my preferred song unless I click the shuffle play. I actually got the premium so I can specifically pick the songs I want and not rely on the shuffle play button, so this is really an issue I'd hope you can solve soon."
Constantly says offline whether on wifi or mobile data when all.other apps using data have no problem 11/2019 Update 2/2021 spotify is not compatible with Android One UI 3. Keeps skipping like a scratched cd on songs I have downloaded
"I really enjoyed want to go premuim again, but it keeps saying Im offline clearly Iam not and tried everything and honestly....I have been let down it could be a great music app. I hope you guys stay on top of it. If it gets fixed up I will give 5 stars no problem"
"Stop ruining my podcast experience. Exclusive deals force me out of the podcast app I love and pay for. Then when I load up Spotify, it constantly tries to play video, which i never want, with no option to turn it off permanently. Beyond that, their audio acceleration engine is stuttery garbage, so i can't even listen to my podcasts at 3.5x like normal. Get your tech figured out. It is unacceptable to have far worse audio quality out of a $70 billion company than an app made by a lone developer"
"I thought it was a decent app until I tried to play my playlist, and a bunch of random songs started playing. Turned out those were "" WhAt yOu AddEd "" jesus. I can't play my ACTUAL playlist without having to listen to bad songs that I hate. I hate this feature so much. Not to mention whenever I try to play a song it just plays another one. Nice job on ruining a perfectly good app with a single feature! :)"
"Worked fine for quite a while, all of a sudden its connecting to random devices that are nowhere near me and I cant fix it. I cant listen to music so this needs to be fixed. No one else has my account either."
"Design is great, like the service in general, but the bugs are constant and frequent. In a ~2hr listen I'll experience anywhere from 1-4 stops, double stream echo, crashes, 5 min rewinds, and other issues. Downloading solves maybe half of the recurring problems, but still nowhere near reliable."
"Its a headache to play JRE podcast. I've been trying to watch the latest podcast and its nearly impossible to figure out how to play video podcast and when I finally thought I figured out how to play the podcast I wanted to watch, its commercial after commercial after commercial after commercial so I finally quit. Closed the app and didn't watch anything."
"Yeah I like the app, but I hate having to open the app to skip the song or pause. so I added a widget to the homescreen. Why do you still have the same widget designed in 2010. It needs to be updated with more controls"
Often slow to load and unresponsive. Poor car interface design. Some podcasts and songs don't even load. Not worth the money.
"This app is backwards. You can't shuffle music added to a queue, you have to create a playlist first, then shuffle that playlist. And once a queue has been created, selecting anything to play after that(hitting the shuffle play of a different artist all together) the music just gets added to the queue? Unshuffled? Instead of doing what the button says it does?? Update: Where is the dislike button? Cant tell the algorithm what i dont like? Listen to 1 mainstream song, get flooded with pop music."
"Not overly easy to use, I can't even queue up songs to make an ad hoc playlist. Even moving songs around within an existing playlist appears impossible on the mobile app. AND they expect all (six) users of family package to live under the same roof. Lots of content but there are several artists that they don't have much material from. Grooveshark were blowing these guys out of the water 8 years ago with a free service. Genuinely only a customer due to lack of competition."
After a song an ad come up with a button to watch an ad for 30 mins of ad free listening it was more like 15 mins. Besides that after a song I've witnessed 4-5 ads in a row. 1 ad per 2 songs is bad enough but 4-5 sometimes is way way to much.
"2 stars, because even though this app is ok, it uses internet to play the downloaded music and does not store the downloads into the music files on my phone to play , listen and enjoy offline without being interrupted by the no connection signal . Mp3 juices downloads directly to my phone files n stores it so I can play n listen always without being disturbed. Modify your app and 5 stars is yours."
"Have been a premium user for years and have had 0 problems until now. The app regularly deletes my 3000+ downloaded songs making me unable to listen off-line. Given my work requires regular plane flights and working In remote areas, when this happens I am stuck without music for a number of days until I can get internet access to redownload. Online forums suggest this has been a problem for a while, and Spotify suggests reinstalling, but this has not worked."
When u press your play list start button it goes to the mid song or songs yall added and that's dumb and sometimes times it want let u pick your song because of the thing that shows peopl I might like and I cant skip through all of it because it cost to that so far trash but like listening to the songs playing games
User experience is horrible. I have been trying to find a way to not automatically play Spotify when I turn my car on. It's distracting and quite annoying. I had to uninstall the app and will cancel my subscription. Never will I use this platform again.
Usually a good app but keeps glitching lately. Stopping music when it says it's playing. Have the wrong song showing but playing the song a different song. Hope this will be fixed quickly
Always used on free Spotify it was great. Upgraded to 3 months free trial and then it went bad. My account was hacked and now all my playlist are ruined. There's over 1000 songs added to my personal playlist not to mention liked artists I've now got to trawl through one by one to delete. Spotify were helpful in removing the hackers but now I need to spend hours I don't have in getting my Spotify back to how I had it previous. I wouldn't pay for it again.
Video quits working after a while. Uninstall then reinstall video works for a while and then quits again. I'm trying to play a song list and the app locks up. Kill app open again still won't play song list. App still thinks it's playing JRE but it's not. I only got the app to listen to Joe. Disappointing Came back tried this app out again. Brought up The Joe Rogan experience got a bunch off ads. Still no video.
"The ui, millions of songs on the go, everything is good so far, but there are way too many advertisements for the basic users like me. What I actually wanna say is that it's ok to have adds at some point, but giving so much just ruins the experience and I think using YouTube music on desktop is somewhat better than using spotify..."
Good when it works but it struggles to find devices to stream to. It eventually found my Sonos speakers but it refused to stream to my Google smart speakers. The only way to get those to work was to use Google Home and play media on them and then select Spotify. Some work required to Spotify App.
A reasonably good app for listening to music. Like others I feel the home screen is a poor design with content in a rather ramdom order which is constantly changing and suggestions that don't interest me it would be good if I could remove content that that doesn't interest me. It also has started showing episodes of a podcast on the home screen which I no longer want to listen to. It would be good if I could remove these altogether!
Great UI and have most of songs but after a month of usage you'll get two ads after a song which is like forcing to buy a premium. Wynk is better alternative to this with hellotunes
"I bought spotify premium for a week and I was so frustrated because the whole point was to be able to listen to your downloaded music without wifi/data. I got logged out of my own account so many times and had no wifi/data to login. My downloaded songs kept re downloading everytime I had to log in. Ultimately, my subscription was a waste. Quite ironic for the number of ads that come in the free version"
The features of the app is great no doubt. But even after you go premium and downloading the songs it won't play during a bad connection it never load!!!! . This kinda sucks.. Unlike playmusic or youtube music it stills roll and play even without an internet connection if you have downloaded the songs. For this reason its only a 2 star from my side since it's not meeting my requirements. Also some of the songs that I like can't be downloaded!! . App is tooo slow
"Please add a straight ""Play"" button to this app. Shuffle shouldn't be the default play option. Tracks are not randomly placed on an album and the default should therefore be to play tracks in the order intended by the artist. Why is this so hard?"
"I rate this app 2 stars, I tried to listen to a song,and I accidentally put it on do not play,so I took it off of that,then... the song just won't play at all!,and when I want to get to the song quickly,I need Spotify premium to skip!,im better off using the pc or Xbox version at this point."
I have used Spotify for a long time now but since the update it keeps having problems. When connecting via Bluetooth to my car it will not show what's playing then when I'm done it continues playing off my phone and I can't turn it off unless I restart my phone. It gets stuck on the song screen showing the wrong song and the buttons doesn't work or lags really bad. It's getting pretty annoying.
"Recent update to android 11 means the app no longer shows the now playing notification, the app doesn't recognize that it's currently playing, and I have to force quit the app to get it to stop. I so not have this issue with other audio apps. Spotify support says it's android 11s fault but I would expect spotify to test their app in android 11 and raise concerns before it launches..."
"Plays any song of its whims instead of playing one I click on. Happens when I am using google devices. Please work on your UI, it's not as intuitive as you would think."
"Much like Facebook it is currently a buggy, unstable and nearly unusable mess. Android Auto rarely works smoothly and will often require restarting the device for it to even connect. Slow, cluttered and painful to use despite the fact that it was a solid app 2 years ago."
"This app is very broken on android to play video. It often doesnt play the correct podcast video, i select a different podcast to watch and it keeps playing the same video until i quit the app and restart. Spotify Ads interrupting a podcast even though I pay for premium should not be happening. Podcasts do not play if connected to vpn, even if vpn is set to same country that I reside in..."
"The old UI from like 2016-2017 was way better, now it looks cheap. Not to mention I don't get barraged with ads from YouTube to watch podcasts like i do with spotify. No comment section for podcasts, Spotify doesn't even keep up with the latest music only mainstream stuff. The playlists like Rapcavier have looked the same for years now, they've barely changed. It just got crappier and crappier through out the years, I use to buy spotify premium all the time now I don't even use it at all."
Spotify has alot of good music with good quality sound. However I don't understand why they ask you to select artists to listen to...and then give you playlists to listen to with not a single song from any of the artists you picked when signing up. Quite disappointed
"Half the time this app doesn't even work. It takes forever to load anything, including downloaded albums/podcasts. Quite regularly the app crashes or freezes during a song. Its so frustrating for a service that I use so often and pay money for to barely work. Spotify really need to fix these huge issues as going off other reviews, these issues are fairly widespread."
"Improvements are made, but when one gets fixed, there's something else that just ruins the experience. Im glad they allow songs to play after the searched track has been finished, however when you search for more and add to Que, the Playlist continues playing its own songs and the que is inaccessible. Have to add the track to a Playlist then play it from that in order to access que."
So many 'basics' not included in the free account. Obvs designed to get peops to pay for 'premium' but pushing it a bit too hard by making the free option so super limited. They also shove songs in the playlist that u haven't chosen as 'recommended' which are rubbish songs. Other than that it's a great app.
"Was a great app. Won't work on any connected bluetooth device or corded device only playing off phone speaker now. Yes I've googled it and went to the geeks. Not fixable, not going to upgrade my phone for your app ill buy an ipod first. S8 issues? Im tired if having to push my home button while driving. I shouldn't be doing that to begin with. All 3 of my cars and all bluetooth device stop and start randomly now. Fix it or lose more money. Im canceling my family plan.thanks."
"Makes you pay for premium so you can loop songs and make it to where they dont force add songs to a playlist you made, just use the computer version, its basically the phone app equivalent of having premium features but its free."
"Current version is flawed. Pauses by itself when connected to Bluetooth, keeps playing on device after disconnecting and disables device volume control until force quit. Will amend review if addressed in next update"
"Ordinarily a decent app, but there's a glaring bug that after playing through android auto, then getting out the car, the music will start playing again. Incredibly annoying and a quick Google search shows this has been going on for a long time. Ridiculous that this still hasn't been fixed."
"At first , this app was great but due to the recent update i couldn't play my liked songs as i wanted instead i had to shuffle play them and i get only 6 skips an hour , that was not there before and when you search for a song , u can't actually listen to the song until u like it and then play it from liked songs if the song comes from the shuffle . Please fix these issues , it's quite annoying and I'm seriously considering other apps for listening to songs instead of spotify !!"
"I am very disappointed by the app. It's so filled with advertisements, I could turn ok the radio and it would be the exact same thing. The adds are also often louder than the songs for some reason, brillant. The fact that you can't just go in your playlist and listen to a specific song is also just dumb. For some reason some older songs can only be found in remastered versions that my be quite different from the original. Guess I'll just keep converting YouTube Videos to get some music"
"I have had Spotify premium for quite some time but in the last week or so it is making me want to throw my phone in a lake. There are random songs/albums appearing in my recently played from artists who do not exist. The app will stop playing a play list I have chosen to play a random song from these non existent artists or just stop all the music all together. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, logged out on all my devices, changed my password and nothing helped"
The free version is not very complete but i actually understand. The real problem is with the next button that I can't click more than six times an hour and the advertisement is too present 😢
This is a great app and i use it all the time but its exrtremely annoying how they prioritize ios users over android. Little features like swiping on a song to quickly add to queue does not exist on android even though its such an easy change to make for spotify. This small feature makes it much more convenient and safer to use especially while driving in the car.
"Quite good, but lately quite buggy. Removes downloads, doesn't play songs, that sort of stuff. Very frustrating, and also while I'm at it I never understood why they removed the search bar at the top of playlists and hid it under a menu, making it needlessly complicated."
"I really want to like this app. I was using YouTube music and enjoying it. I didn't like that it didn't suggest new music very well, kind of just played my same old stuff all the time. I had heard Spotify was really good for suggesting new music based on what you listen to. Just search a song you like and go down a rabbit hole of new music. Sadly, first time I tried this it would okay the song I searched then stop. Since then I've found many glitches. Not sure I'll be a continuing costumer"
"Good for listening to and discovering new music, but the podcast function needs work - I've been unable to play podcasts via Spotify on my android phone - aside that, visibility and navigating to podcasts is clunky i.e. where it is easy to quickly jump into a playlist or start listening to random music from the app landing page with a tap or 2, podcasts are not so, requiring a less than optimal traversal through the app to get to desired podcast content"
"My Experience GOOD: On Laptop/PC it's great, apart from the ads, select any song and do what you want with it. What you want from this app. BAD: Mobile. Tablet or phone its just terrible. Without premium its just asswater. Ads everywhere. Press one button and an ad. You can't get the song you want too. You have to play liked songs / albums in SHUFFLE. Without the right settings on the second/third song it will play a song OUTSIDE OF THE ALBUM. Only 14 day holidays before you are logged out too"
"Having an issue with ""like button"". Never gets green, even with previously liked songs. Also the ""liked songs playlist"" is gone. Stops playing for no reason. Fix these please"
I've always like using Spotify during traveling time that's why I subscribed to premium. But recently I noticed its been giving issue where it stopped in the middle of the song and doesn't allow any skips. And I realised the mandarin songs will not have the latest or hottest songs. Its ridiculous for me to continue subscribe further if this two issue doesn't fix at all especially the first!! I hope you can quickly fix it!
I've used Spotify more than 2 years now .The amount of ads being played is just insane now .I know they want us to get premium but this is ruining the whole experience..if the ads become more frequent then I guess we just have to stop using spotify
"App is really going downhill. The option to repeat a song or playlist is near impossible as the repeat button cannot be located, if even still in existence. There is absolutely no option to stop Spotify from automatically adding songs to your playlist, if anyone wanted them they would add them themselves instead of using this outrageous auto-add feature. None of these things existed in previous versions, and many customers including myself are downright fed up with them. Wouldn't recommend."
"App is buggy as hell. Will randomly skip back 40 minutes, will stop 1 minute after engaging background play, will skip back 5 min upon hitting the ""back 15 sec"" button. But every once in a while it will work perfectly. About a quarter of the time."
"When using it for podcasts , it would stuck on the picture of one episode, but the sound of the next. On the next day will stuck fully. I need to go to my phone settings and use the force stop .Then would start from the right spot and whit the right video, but only until the next day . It's quite annoying and I wouldn't use it, but there is one podcast available only there 😉, so no choice. Anyway, you took the video content before you been ready for it .Hopefully you will fix it some day"
"Ive been using spotify for a long time but I'm really disappointed. When I choose a song it only plays a preview,I can't play the whole song. So I have no choice but to click the shuffle button to play a whole song. I can't choose on my own. Please fix it ASAP!"
Web player on PC works great. app on phone really unreliable. regularly have to restart app to get to work. always hanging. graphics get stuck.
"Long time user, but the latest updates have some really annoying bugs. For example, the green ""play"" button (not the white triangle) for individual tracks doesn't work/respond and neither does the ""sort"" function. I tap and tap away and nothing happens. Just installed another update and there have been no fixes to the above issues. So frustrating that I cant play individual tracks searched for Also, sometimes when playing the next track in a podcast it'll jump ahead 4 or 5 episodes randomly stil"
"You guys used to be incredible. No interruptions, easy to use, when I hit play...it played. But now...I have to click like five or 6 different things just to get to my music. I DONT WANT CAR VIEW. I DONT WANT TO CONNECT TO A NAVIGATION APP. I DONT WANT TO LISTEN TO SOME RANDOM ALBUM FROM A BAND I ACCIDENTLY HIT A YEAR AGO. Quit. Asking. Whoever came up with this dumb car view thing needs to he fired. Honeslty....you guys used to he incredible. Never minded the 10 bucks a month...now..not so much"
Used to be great. The new update ruined everything. It doesnt want to play the song you selected. I chose a song and a COMPLETELY random song played. I hate this app now.
"I used to love Spotify Premium. Now it plays songs in my playlists that I didn't add, and it only plays in shuffle. As soon as I find another streaming player that suits my needs, I'm out."
"It's all well saying watch an add for half an hour of no adds. But I've been getting anywhere between 5-20 adds in a row. An add after every song, it's really quite annoying and I've not got the money for premium"
"I got lured with 3 months for the price of 1 and yet again, I know, this won't be extended subscription. Basically mobile app hangs and crashes way too often. Unless you want to play the pre-made playlist as is, song based radio or random list without skipping, it works, but skipping tracks, and I mean skipping 2-5 songs often causes app to simple hang and fail playing any music. Another thing is how podcasts are shoved into your feed. I don't like them, I don't listen them, and have no idea if I can even hide them because UI of the app is atrocious. Since it's creation, spotify navigation is as pleasant as wiping with charred stick would be. Not so great. Terrible to be honest. Last thing, I was would be working, was algorhythm, which used to be really cool, giving interesting tunes and bands to check but even that got wrecked somehow. If by chance, I wanted to listen to one particular song once, it will be coming back and forth each week but if I listen to certain songs on and on, I won't get any suggested playlists which actually could be linked to those tracks. How come? Algorhythm used to be really well made. Shame."
"Spotify has simply-put bad UX design. It is good at artist discovery, but the app is MISERABLE to use. -I can't download individual songs but instead can only download albums -When there's a song I was listening to in an album, and I want hear it again, I have to tap ""previous"" to cycle through all previous songs, when instead I could've just had the list of the songs in the album, and tapped the one I want listen to And there's more, but I can't mention them all here. The app is not intuitiv"
Spotify always shut down unexpectedly when played. I have to tap play button to play songs multiple times and it is annoying as it always shut down when I am listening.
"My only problem is the song switching. I had like: 50 songs in my playlist, made sure it was the right playlist too. Out of nowhere, a very unfamiliar song came up. It was a christmas song; I know it's the time of the year but when did I ever searched up christmas songs and liked it. Even when I skip 6 times, after the song on my playlist ends christmas music plays again. I can no longer skip. Do you now need premuim to listen to your music freely without random music playing after??"
It's nice and has songs I like but Im' really picky with my music and when they add songs I don't want to hear because if I wanted to hear them I would put it in my playlist and I can't use play music (the app that I used to download my music to) because it is pretty much dead. I liked it for first but now I pretty much hate it Look! I tried to listen to two songs of AC/DC and Traitor's Requim and it played both of the ACDC songs but no Traitor's requim. And who the heck is George Thorogood?!
"i give this two stars because when i ""watch an ad for 30 min of UNINTERRUPTED LISTENING"" i dont get 30 min of uninterrupted listening. one song later, i get an add. also, quit adding songs into my playlists."
"Glitchy app, queue functionality is god awful, especially when listening to podcasts, and the UI is inconsistent (e.g.long press works in some places but not others). Also offline use is sometimes impossible even if you've downloaded music for offline use. I continue to use because it's the cheapest and most convenient option for me, and the range of music is pretty comprehensive, but I regularly get angry at it."
"I understand that you guys made the best app for music... But do you really need to give us that much ads... I mean really, I played a song and an ads pops up, I accept it...but after that ad here comes an another Stupid ad that makes no sense.... This is torcher and a big one. Stop this and do it quick and if you can't so just tell me I have other options too!!!"
"I had a free Spotify account for quite some time and I really liked it. I liked it so much that I decided to shell out for the full version. I looooved it. I used it constantly. Then covid happened. our household income was cut in half. The free Spotify was good so I went back to that. Now, it seems Spotify holds that against you. I get maybe 2 songs before I get 3 adds. We have the free version at work and it's easily half hour between songs. Not making me want to come back."
"Its really sad to see how greed can ruin something so special. Where do I start. 1st of all not everyone can afford a premium plan, the fact they have made it to where you cant even pick a song to play anymore without paying is insane, If a song you dont like comes on your probaly hesitant to skip it because you only get six skips a day which is a joke, and last but CERTAINLY not least DEAR GOD THE ADS. You are flooded with 3 to 5 ads after like 3 songs which blows. I highly recomend soundcloud"
When it works it works. But now moving back to Premium (after cancelling for some time) its quite a pain to sync with my smart devices. And now after reinstalling I can't even log on anymore. So will try YT Music
"Experience with Google Chromecast is now dreadful. All other services work fine on Chromecast. My Android phone and Chromecast end up out of sync. Mobile shows music is paused whilst Chromecast cast is quite happily playing music. Machine learning algorithms seems a little ""lazy"" these days. Discover weekly playlist shortlisting songs you have heard many times before. Not been impressed of late to be honest."
Extremely good app for streaming music and the recommendation given for the songs is also nice.... But now whole experience is ruined for free users coz after every 2 songs u have to listen to 3 ads each of 30 seconds
"Great music library and app design but very limited in terms of sound quality. If you want the ability to stream high res music (CD quality or better) look elsewhere as this is not currently available on Spotify. Edit following Spotify reply: Thanks but I've already added my vote to the 23,000 other votes. Not that it will do much good, this is by far the most popular idea on the community forums and Spotifys responses has been more or less non-existant, the last update was over 3 years ago!"
"1 it asks for your gender, just to sell to advertisers. 2 you can't remove playlists from your recently played section. 3 can't easily just stop a playlist all together It's mind-numbing how poorly this app is designed, but I guess when you monopolized the market who cares."
"Love the app but recently it freezes A LOT. It also seems to skip tracks with the volume buttons and I can't figure out how to turn it off. The ""contact"" and ""help"" don't seem to have any troubleshooting."
"Horrible, basic, unintuitive UI. No way to play cache, doesn't play local library. Would also be nice to customize the home screen and not have things I'd never listen to shoved in my face. They rake in billions but only the biggest artists make any money. The bands that need it the most get the lowest ratio. No transparency or useful information when updating. The GNU/Linux client is bloated and slow. Would be nice if they worked with open source applications to ensure good official plugins"
"This app is an inconvenience now a days I can't even play through songs without the app suddenly stopping the track, and restarting the entire song. It ruins the experience having to anticipate when a song will just blatantly stop or restart. Please fix thank you!"
"I use spotify regularly across platforms and eversince I have had the app it has always been very slow in registering my likes, or actually playing the song when I press play. I cannot believe the programers of this truly remarkable platform could miss this. It makes me exit the app. I have also tried reinstalling the program a few times. I am a samsung note 8 user so the hardware os quite poweeful as well. We expect the best from you Spotify! And this is below average."
As a listening app its pretty good. Bringing Joe rogan across without consulting at least entry level UX designers was a really stupid idea. The UI is so hard to navigate. the window for info about the podcast with the video opened up is tiny. There so much free unused space as well its really irritating. Obviously no comments and little else to look at before and after which is arguably healthy since 9/10 times ill go do something else.
"Podcasts on Spotify suck. JRE is laggy all the time and sometimes the video will disappear. Clearing the app and reopening doesn't help, so might have to force quit. Or maybe Spotify has a plot against Joe rogan"
"Buggy, freezes and gets confused often. Unintuitive and slow to respond. Lucky they have a strong catalog. Their web player is equally badly designed."
i love using spotify but lately when i get on and try to search for an artist after i click on the artist that i was looking for i can't see their music cause and error message pops up saying something went wrong but when i click on the button that says try again to try and refresh the page the same thing happens
"I like that I can listen music, but the MOBILE UI is so badd! It keeps adding useless songs based on what I listen. 6 Skips per hour? Id rather use Soundcloud on mobile, and spotify on PC. You have gone to far now."
"I use both spotify on my phone and PC, and on my PC I can request my own songs when, but on phone you can't? It's quite annoying...also I wanted to make a small playlist of just 2 songs, but spotify kept adding random songs to my playlist.."
"The app is draining my battery so quickly for some reason, I used to be able to listen to music for a super long time now my battery will go from 90 to 30 in a hour or so, why is this a thing? I don't have this problem with any other app"
"Filled with bugs. Notably, I have to constantly clear the apps cache and data to make it stop playing, to fix unresponsive buttons on phone and wearable, or to enable my galaxy watch to remote connect. The watch seems to operate in stand alone just fine on LTE. Come on guys, I expect better. Premium subscriber. Galaxy S20 5g Ultra and Galaxy Watch Active 2 LTE."
"The video player is so unintuitive. Why is it so difficult to remove the HUD without minimizing the video? Just do what youtube does and keep it simple, this is ridiculously annoying"
It completely ruins the experience when you're trying to listen to a specific playlist with very specific songs but have to deal with a bunch of suggested songs. I've wasted my 6 skips trying to get to the songs I want to listen to all day. This needs to be fixed.
It was fine at the start but then the shuffle button appeared and it meant i couldn't play songs in the order i wanted. Also it adds random songs to your playlist and that really annoyed me.
"Please for the love of god, gives us a dislike button. We used to have one here & on the PC version and now we don't. What's the point of making suggestions for songs I may like if I can't even tell you which ones I've listened to and don't like?? How does that benefit either one of us? It doesn't help the algorithm fine-tune itself to my style of music. Sure, you still get clicks and media-play, but now you've got angry consumers. Don't fix what isn't broken. Bring the Dislike button back."
Currently... when i open the Spotify apps.. and I click my fav song.. and its different.. before this... when i click my fav song.. Its the design of it like this.. LAGUE OF LAGEND K/DA MORE ... K/DA THE BADDEST (and more) And it can just turn it on ... And when it happend its show like this ... LAGUELAGEND (botton turn it on) MORE • POP/STARS • THE BADDEST • MORE • VILLIAN • And when i turn it on.. it not TURN the right song... pls fix
It's a good one but shows a loads of ads whenever a song is played freshly after opening the app which makes so inconvenience and disguisting. Such unwanted and continuous streaming of ads makes really unreliable and had to wait long to get the ads finished! Hope such issues are taken into consideration as a feedback and be fixed soon!
"I've many liked songs, but it always play suggested songs and it won't play even 1 of the songs that I've liked. It keeps on playing suggested songs even when you press the shuffle play button in the liked songs. I hope the developers can fix this cause I hate the suggested songs so much."
"Songs that have been downloaded should be hidden when the premium period has expired, not removed from the download list. Very disappointed because hundreds of songs require a lot of data packages."
"Spotify is a great idea with a terrible app they never fix. For a company seeking to be top of the audio world, nevermind the broken app, it also has pretty low functionality compared to other audio players out there. Give your users everything. Shuffle the entire artist section online or offline. The ""Queue"" has nothing going on. If you pick a song to play it auto fills w/ songs you can't clear easy. Sometimes you want to build a playlist as you listen to it w/ ""play next"" or ""append"" options"
What the heck spotify?! I create a playlist and you add songs to it yourself? I dont want songs I didn't put in my playlist added without my consent. There needs to be an opt out button. I delete a song you added and you instantly add another. This is not okay. I will adjust my review if this is adjusted.
"The oh so frequent ads for non premium users are annoying. But the most important problem now is that the songs I add to the queue are not showing up in the queue and I can't edit the order. Only the latest added song shows up and thus, the queue plays in reverse order. The like button doesn't change when I like a song and more glitches galore."
"I love this App and also pay for Premium, as of late, the player freezes while music still plays but shows a different song. When this happens it allows me to skip tracks but not pause or play songs or see what's currently playing. The quickest fix for me is restarting my phone and to be honest, I get sick of doing that 3-4 times a day. I also have times where spotify just stops playing music, changes tracks half way through and replays the current song after 2 seconds."
"The app's been slow for a long time, and recently it's gotten worse. I go to a podcast episode and it simply won't play. Songs play after waiting a bit. The button reacts but nothing happens. Also, all the podcasts that I follow are gone and I can't follow any podcasts, it also doesn't register when I like songs. I've been a premium member for a long time and I'm severely disappointed in the app over the last few weeks."
It's good anyway....but the main and only problem is the ads.....just now too I'm hearing to spotify.....had 3 ads in a row....(each ad is about 30secs)It's really boring.....even youtube is charging ads....but we got a skip option.....spotify is kinda doing buisness to make every users buy that damn premiumship😑*Ok bei*
"I'm having problems lately concerning playing songs. I know some songs require premium to play, but the thing is, I have premium. Certain songs just aren't playing. Some songs are darkened and when I try to play them the thing at the bottom of the screen that says what song is playing pops up but then disappears right away. These are songs that I should be able to access. Ex: The South Park movie soundtrack and songs by Talkshow Boy. Please fix this. What is the point of songs you can't play."
"Didn't do it for me. Had a feeling of being guided or steered towards music I felt was lame. That and the skipping 6 songs and embedded commercials... Jeez I see why I wasn't an 'early adopter' or casual listener. Id rather use deezer, mixcloud, SoundCloud or icecast."
"Constantly freezes, images do not load consistently, takes a long time to pause/stop playing music. These problems occur randomly and reinstalling or restarting my device doesn't help. Please suggest a better solution. Edit: The app again has new bugs, notably back button doesn't work while in the app and likes are not synchronized across the app."
"Premium member but not sure how much longer, its started glitching in the middle of songs and not just occasionally happens quite frequently."
"Car mode is useless, landscape mode is terrible, touch area for buttons is not accurate, making playlists is worse than pulling teeth. Im not pleased to pay for this"
"Glitching out real bad. I've recently cancelled my Spotify Premium but it's still active until the end of the month. However, after confirming this in the app, its started glitching wherein stops mid song and disappears off my lockscreen. I think this has been built in to encourage continued subscription of its premium service. I wont be using the free spotify version if this glitch isn't fixed"
"there should be a designated area for everything I have downloaded I hate scavenging for leftovers when I'm listening offline my downloads delete over every weekend. even if I listen to music on Saturday it's deleted by Monday. i got premium to listen to music on the bus but it's been happening weeks. usually it only deletes a few, not everything but I literally had to sit with just screaming kids an hour and a half. my fiance has been having the same problem with his downloads for a long time"
Ad store!! Why is it written free music? There's nothing free in there. After every song there will be a irritating ad played which ruins the mood. And frequently it shows to upgrade to premium so why is it written free?
"Spotify has one of the largest music libraries available, and their space in the market is earned, but c'mon guys your app development is trash. Why can't there be a quick list of all downloaded songs somewhere? even if I download an album, it still uses data when I'm not in offline mode. I know my listening history data is being harvested and sold, so why can't spotify recommend anything besides ""two white guy"" podcasts? And finally, why the hell is there no scroll bar for long lists?"
Not intuitive to learn how to create playlists or do other simple functions. Like that ads are relatively obscure.
"this app has some bad bugs from time to time, but the most annoying one is where if you press play on a song it doesnt show up, it shows the song i was listening to the last time i used the app, and you cannot stop the player unless you force quit. this has been an issue for the past 2 months and becoming super annoying"
"I HATE how they literally try to force me to get premium Spotify. It doesn't give a lot of skips and I don't like how I'm not able to see the playlist I made and choose the song I want, instead I hv to press the play button and it just shuffles songs hence I'm not able to listen to the song I want.. i used to LOVE this app before, now I rarely use it."
"10 bucks a month for basically any audio ive looked for is great! But i think the people who created this app has not used it enough, the samsung built in player is perfect and moving to this is not the best and spotify should be getting on this, i should be able to go to a recently added section, its janky and shuts down or stops, pauses, its just not as smooth as it could be"
"It's good for free music but it's such a pain to use with the menu design and how often it crashes, and I have songs in my playlists that shuffle play never goes on"
The new update doesn't let me see the songs in am album and whenever i press the play button random songs starts coming. I hope you will cancel this update amd bring it to the previous state
"Make Spotify the same as it is on iOS!!! Honestly I might switch to YT Premium if you don't quit leaving Android behind. You are adding to the iOS app exclusively nearly every fortnight. Having looked at my friend's Spotify on their iOS the other day I am amazed that it can have so many differences. No swipe/slide gestures which iOS have had for so long now, no refined playlists, no stories...no fun! It's the same app it was this time last year and has not evolved on android at all."
"A 30 second advertisement was okay with, but now it's 3 to 4 advertisements in a row?-- I used premium subscription for a very long time and I planned on coming back eventually again - but are you seriously trying so hard to lose your clients over your greediness? Thanks for ruining music for everyone."
"Was a great app until the most recent update, now all I get is lag, songs won't change no matter how many times I push the button, the app keeps crashing, it's glitchy as all h*** etc. Etc. Terrible time using this app this past week, please fix these issues!!"
It's a good app for muisc but there are 3 ads after every 2 songs and that's very irritating... it's like badly compelling users to make the subscriptions at any cost. Also when they make us watch a particular ad saying uninterrupted music for next 30 mins that never happens after 2 songs the ads start again.👎👎👎
"PSA: Spotify Lite App works. It just works. Spotifys main app, as become a bloated mess that simply is broken. Uninstalling does not help, clearing cache and hidden cache does nothing, factory resetting the phone is a waste. This app needs a complete foundational recoding. Going back to version 7 works, but is broken due network coding errors. V.7 cannot talk to the v.8 database fully. Spotify Lite, works perfectly and does not have any bloat ware that as completely ruined this main app."
I love this app but there is problem every song app has internet there is no problem another problem graphics is not good. We cant download songs that is big problem. That is why I give two stars. I tell you to improve this app please This is very very very nice app but please whichever problems please solve it
"it's a good app, but I dont like the fact that you can't instantly play an album or song. Also, please add a reshuffle button, and stop giving me 4 adds at once after 3 songs"
"Used to love my spotify. But with the covid layoffs and up and down paychecks they've made me change my mind. No matter I've been with them for YEARS, they got no problem turning all my premium options off quick as hell."
Very buggy experience with chromecast. They also butchered the UI for viewing and sorting through songs that are cached/saved on the device.
"Ads, ads, and ads, after 2-3 songs, ad is must. I think after sometime it will just like to hear only the ads, nothing else. ☹️ It's graphics are really good . 🙂"
"This app has gone to absolute s*** the past few months, constantly skipping past songs, playing songs but showing a different song to what's playing and constantly disconnecting whatever speaker I'm listening to, sometimes it's like there a ghost in the app looking for ways to p*** me off, used to be amazing now its rubbish especially when I'm paying 10 quid a month for an app that half the time I cant even use, defo going to be ca.celing my subscription if this continues!!!!!!"
"Non user friendly interface, queue management is awful,starting from inability to simply clear the queue. Car mode make certain operations, like queue view, impossible. Song buffering is short and impossible to configure. If during normal playback connectivity is gone sound start hiccup quickly. Bluetooth integration with car also bloated with issues. After phone establishes connection program need 5-15 minutes to understand that and start playback. Song counter is always 1/1."
"Spotify has a great library. BUT, do not download content and expect that Spotify will not eat up your wireless data. I downloaded a bunch of podcasts. I started listening to my downloaded podcasts, and was completely shocked to see that Spotify was still streaming the content I had downloaded. You must, in addition to downloading the content, ensure that you have activated Offline Mode. This is not intuitive or user friendly, and could be very expensive to the unwary end user."
"The app is so frustratingly slow to search anything most of the time (online or offline mode). It often can't connect to the internet despite having full signal. The online ""solutions"" are basically uninstall and reinstall it, which usually works for a few days then it goes back to being so slow it's almost unusable. Were it not for the fact that i actually quite enjoy the vast library of songs, the song/artist/album radio, and the discover weekly i would have cancelled my subscription already"
"Glitchy with new update - It will stop playing my music randomly then when I open the app, it freezes on what song was first played when the app was opened and you cannot see what song is currently playing and the skip/play buttons will not work either. You need to force stop the app and it's horrible"
"Playlists are great, love the ui, but it runs like ass on my phone, spotify lite runs perfectly, but thus one's incredibly laggy. I'm on a motorola one action, not a terrible phone, if I can max out PUBG I should be able to run spotify no problem, but for some reason I can't."
so I changed my review because...Welp..i noticed on laptop or desktop you can chose the song your listing to and you don't get random songs in your mixes ....and Well I miss the old spotifi because I could choose my song on mobile..and this Spotfi usted to be my go to app for when I had suicidal or anyzitey attacks...well what it used to help and I cant pay for a member ship because im not old enough for a job....im 16..but weree I live they don't higher at that age so..yaa..
Horrible UI and even worse UX. It clearly looks as if it a badly ported app from iOS and no time is invested into it. It that has many issues let alone third party connection issue. Unfortunately it is the only popular app right now for music.
"I can not log into spotify using my Amazon Fire stick. I have tried many methods to get it to work and yet the login button still becomes frozen and will not load my profile. I pay the premium, so I expect premium quality. Please resolve this issue ASAP. Or I will be asking you to reimburse me for my troubles."
It is an AMAZING app. The song suggestions are amazing and the UI is smooth. Huge library and live the feature to follow other people on spotify and see their personal playlists. The only issue is WAYYY TOO MANY ADS!!!!!!!!!!!!! 30-45 sec of unskippable ads is driving me crazy. Completely ruins everything I mean youtube also has ads now but they are tolerable but ads on Spotify are way too many and way too long
"The mobile version is really pushing the consumer to be premium members. The lack of control is annoying (from unbearable ads to the queuing algorithm, 'shuffle play?' what a bummer 🙄). I don't feel like I'm missing out on premium features but I jus feel like I'm being punished and left with no choice but to go premium or leave the app."
What a Great App But sometimes literally ruin the entire app usage by getting annoying ads. I literally got 3 ads while playing a single song. I think One ad is Sufficient.
"The player is always freezing while the song is just fine, I use the premium, and this sucks, the song playing doesn't match the song that is displayed playing in the player. Also sometimes the pause button doesn't work and the song keeps on playing. I have big storage left and this app keeps on doing the same thing again nd can't enjoy my listening. Gone to their website and said twitter is the best way to ask questions well I don't want to create twitter!"
"I'm a huge rock fan, anyone like me knows when our rock is interrupted it p**ses us off, we want to rip someone face off, genuinely. But then its like hey, you watch this short add and you get 30 minutes of straight rock. So to you devs, thank you for this feature, then it goes out and gives me 2 to 4 adds before my uninterrupted music then again proceeds to give me another add in 10 minutes. In other words, devs, finna f**king rip your arms off and beat you with them. This turned out violent.."
"Without Premium, this app is quite useless & pointless. It's very limited, Literally begging you to buy Premium so you can actually use Spotify properly. Even when i try to buy Premium with PayPal, it doesn't work and also doesn't give me lots of countries to choose from. At this point, the only reason i have this app still, is because i can share my playlist to other people. Besides that feature, i prefer to use BlackPlayer that works perfectly fine for me and it's much better in my opinion."
I Was Bored One day and decided to listen to music But then I Picked a song But It Wont play I kept clicking The play button but it wont work I thought I might have just Accidently Sprayed water into it so I just took a tissue and wiped it but still didnt work So i kept wiping it but it still didnt work So I reinstalled it 4 times and it didnt work But After many times It started playing now But when I picked a song again It played another Song from another album I tried plenty of times but fail
"this app which I pay so much for is really becoming a nuisance . It plays a total other song which I didn't ask for and more other things that are not correct. Why it keeps putting playlists I don't want to hear and cannot remove from the list , this is not done! Maybe I just should stop my subscription. I keep uninstalling it, it just won't work properly! Stay out of my lane Spotify and do what you suppose to do!"
The longer I'm using this app the worse it goes. When I leave phone for some time like one or more hours on idle it can took even ONE minute to launch and another minute just to play music. Sometimes doesn't respond to my requests like PLAY AND PAUSE. Changing music can be a struggle too. It behaves like it was always tired. Giving two stars because for the first year it was working splendidly and this three months for one euro was good trial and I don't want to quit Spotify.
"The ui is ok.....but the app sometimes becomes a huge *bleep* and says ""no conection even if EVERYTHING ELSE says otherwise and there are too many repetitive annoying long ads....... other than that its useful and i love it but change these issues and i would rate at least 5"
"Half the time song playing won't allow me to use controls and will freeze as the song playing, downloaded songs often take multiple minutes to load in low reception areas, currently there is no play buttons available and it refuses to work with my work trucks steering wheel controls, basically If im sick of the song and can't get to my phone I have to shut the stereo off entirely."
"When watching video, massive UI is in the way I end up moving 30-40min and not able to get the play button off the screen. Also their employees are emotional midgets."
"Everything worked fine for me, but recently when plays playlist, or album app always shows same song, but playing another, also duration of track is nonsensical. I can't even hit the pause button and always have to force quit the app to stop playing. The app doesn't even recognize that song is playing."
"Recent update has caused a lot of playback issues, the player UI also tends to get out of sync with what's actually playing on the local device. They also need to provide a way to toggle video streaming on and off for Joe Rogan Experience."
"Been a long term user of Spotify, only recently run into issues with it saying it has no internet connection, a permanent ""Spotify is trying to play..."" Notification, songs failing to start or pausing randomly, and the basic music playing functions have stopped popping up (no play, skip, progress bar button etc)"
"Fantastic app overall, last update has caused a lot of glitches and malfunctions which means I have to close and reopen frequently e.g. Wrong song playing, can't stop playback, can't control from lock screen, etc. I have seen these comments coming in for over a week now and nothing has been done which is disappointing - usually a great user experience but they've dropped the ball on this one and are slow to pick it back up for paying customers."
"I know that music app like Spotify need money to run such good collection of music. But to promote the Spotify premium, the way they play Spotify premium ads continuesly is so annoying. And even to buy Spotify premium, it is far more expensive than any other music app in India. Dear Spotify, play genuine 3rd party ads if you get in proper way instead of annoying listener's with same ad about Spotify premium. And if you want to subscribe, please decrease the subscription price."
Latest update has caused numerous issues: • Unable to connect with Sonos speaker • UI not displaying correct music • Pausing music and attempting to play causes previous song to lose progress requiring user to start song again Unacceptable considering Premium price
"I have had some errors in the app, I believe that it happened after the last actualization, its so weird, can you solve it quickly? I'm not satisfied because I am paying a premium plan and the app isn't working good and appropriately."
I love using spotify but something has come up in the past few days. So I had my phone taken away for a few day (yes i am still a minor). I was using my computer and decided to make a new acc. because i didnt want to use my dads anymore. So when i made it one the website i took me several tries over the corse of 3 days. When i was able to make the acc. i went to press the plus button to add a song nothing happened. I tried closing the app and restarting but nothing happened. -please fix this-
"artist view doesn't have popular songs anymore it's poplar albums. not able to see all songs in album view anymore just a jumbled mess of a few songs with an unclickable ""and more..."" button."
"Everything loads slowly, even downloaded playlists. Doesn't seem to sync with the PC app. Overall poor user experience."
"The new update has ruined it, it used to be easy to search up a song and play it, now it won't let me do that, have I changed something or is this the update because it's annoying me, I also can't play certain songs I want on my playlists rather than shuffle playing the ENTIRE playlist and then having to skip which it won't let me do because I don't have premium"
"Great streaming app however I'm experiencing difficulties when I updated this to the latest version and it says that I am offline even though I am connected to our Wi-Fi and I'm assured this isn't a connection problem since it runs fast in other apps requiring cellular connection. The weird thing is when I connect to other data sources such as mobile data/hotspot, it becomes online and downloads the songs that I want to download. I hope there will be a response solution to this problem."
Subscribed to Spotify premium yesterday. Following issues need to be taken care. 1. Download buttons for each separate songs. 2. Some songs doesn't play even after it is shown in search. 3. The UI needs to be more easy to use.
"can you guys fix this app? after each song, it stops to play. This happens everytime. I always update this app, and the new version made it this way. I cant keep pressing the next button y'know. I want it to play continuously"
"I switched over to spotify for the Joe Rogan podcast, but spotify does not understand how to play 'downloaded' episodes. Every time you walk near a WiFi hotspot spotify service stops for sometimes minutes at a time and you get 'spotify is trying to play' in your notifications, and the app says 'no internet connection' Why do you need an internet connection to play a 'downloaded' episode? At my job i have to walk in and out of our building allot, and everytime it stops, google podcast superior"
"The selection of music is quite nice, but the app has some annoying peculiarities: If I am listening to a song I like and I want to start a radio from that song why can't I just tap on ""start radio"" instead of ""go to radio page"" and then have to re-tap on the song? And why do I have to tap on the song to be able to change the source (eg I sometimes play from my Sonos)? Also, I can't switch from my sonos to my phone now (says phone is unavailable?)"
"I really do like & enjoy this app, the only thing I hate about it is how it automatically plays music when one gets in their car. It's a nuisance,. Annoying after a while."
The update won't let me stream Spotify on my 2020 MINI Cooper Countryman. There used to be a built-in/integrated Spotify App. Now it's not there anymore. And I've seen that a lot of other MINI owners are experiencing the same thing. I can stream through Bluetooth but the functionality is very limited compared to the integrated version. Is this something you're aware of and will there be a fix soon?
I am in the middle of listening to the songs I hearted which include rap and reggae. The app suggested Tayler Swift. As good as she is I am not interested that style of music. I can't even skip the song. I hit the remove button an it just says hidden in the play list. The song suggestions are way off.
"If you dont buy premium this app will continue to annoy you. I have no problems with the ads, my biggest problem is I have 900 liked songs and everyday when I shuffle my liked songs at work I hear the same songs everyday. It never changes and gets boring and irritating quickly. This app will only cater to you if you pay monthly. Even though as a free listener you get spammed with ads you'd think the shuffle button would actually shuffle your songs, yet there seems to be some sort of algorithm."
Music collection is awesome. But they irritate and ruin your entire day with the ads begging you to buy Spotify premium; more ads than music. And in the ads they'll play a story of some person whose good mood gets ruined by ads between music. WHAT AN IRONY! YOU DO THE EXACT SAME THING TO ME YOU STUPID DEVELOPERS!!! YOU RUIN MY MOOD AND DAY BY FORCING ME TO LISTEN TO SOMEONE ELSE'S STORY ABOUT HOW THEIR DAY GOT RUINED WITH ADS!!! EITHER REMOVE YOUR ADS OR ATLEAST PLAY SOME LO-FI BEAT AS AN AD.
"I'm editing my review. I'm a very old Spotify user. I've no premium subscription currently, I understand adds are important for any app but still, even I start the first song, an add pops up saying ""watch this to get 30mins of uninterrupted listening"". It's not good, at least let me start my music! Also the claim is not genuine, I don't get 30 mins of no interruption. Please give some relaxation for non premium users."
"Love listening to music, but the ""click now to watch a quick ad and receive 30 mins of ad free listening"" is a total lie. You end up with like 5 ads, and don't even get 30 minutes of ad free listening."
I liked the app at first its easy to use and its quick but com'on do i really have to get spotify to chose the song i want when im only 14 guys i cant pay neither my family does so please remove that plus the app hasnt been working these days the songs suddenly stop playing and its not because of enternet connection it just stops and my playlists dont show up at my library can you please fix that i thought music was the only free thing in the world and now i have to pay for it!
"Lately there are too many ads which are being run and frankly its quite irritating and frustrating. Spotify is losing its charm of a quality music app. I just 2 mins ad and then when i click on a song again some 30 seconds ad is played. What the hell is happening, please reduce the no. Of ads otherwise there is no point sticking to spotify."
"It started okay. I managed to try your premium promo for 3months. At first I'm really disappointed because when I'm in this promo whenever I play a song it stops suddenly,this continued until the 1st month. I wanted to end my free premium subscription right there and then but could'nt do so because my profile doesnt have that ""plan"" button. i was frustrated that your ad is a bit misleading. You do said that your client can unsubscribe whenever they want."
It doesn't seem at all good.. because if u won't use the app for 1 day or more than that.. it genuinely doesn't work..it only shows me blank screen..even after restarting the app again and again..it shows me the same..I reinstall it hoping it would be because of my network issue but actually it isn't..so yeah I doesn't like spotify..coz it never works when I need it to work..
"Super slow, i often have to quit and reload the app just to be able to browse because it never works first time. Literally only use it because I'm on a family premium plan, it's terrible"
"The app is SOO buggy and BROKEN, especially with internet off and listening to music/podcasts in offline mode. No menus would load until I restart the app. Once I turn wifi on, it's the same dance a second time for some reason. Sometimes the play button doesn't work until I restart the app. Sometimes the music stops randomly by itself. Why am I paying monthly for such a BROKEN app?! Idk and I won't for much longer."
I really dont like the new UI. It shows only 5 song recommendations from artists now. And added more clicks to view their albums... Plus it shows me my marked albums first when clicking artists. Just show me the song recommendations.. there is a separate part in library to view my marked albums..why show it to me when clicking on artists Don't add more clicks. AND Don't just change UI of a music player
Sometimes i accidentally clicked on - button which removes song from my liked list and after that i can't play that song in liked list anymore either i remove it from like list or add it again in like list. atleast give us option when we again like that song this should go live in like list.
"Experiencing too many glitches for an app run by a multi-billion dollar company. My podcasts randomly stop playing, it loses my place in episodes, and the UI is garbage."
"Wait. So everyone complained about the ""canvas"" feature (videos playing in background) for so long, so they finally gave in and added an option to disable it. But now they quietly make it so you can only disable it if you choose Low Quality music?! Hahaha!!! You can tell Spotify cares more about the big corporate musical artists who want to advertise their videos, rather than the actual users paying for the service."
"Great product, app ui on android needs fixing. Can't swipe to queue, can't scroll to top of Playlist above the cover art to search, can't fast forward songs and podcasts from lockscreen. All these features have been on ios for years, Spotify should really consolidate app design across platforms as much as the OS allows them to."
"I love this app but changes need to be made I am so bored everytime I search for a song I press play then a song I don't want plays , I press next 6 times then I can't press next anymore and I have not played the song I wanted please at least give us unlimited next buttons and make sure that when I click a certain song and I press play I get that certain song 2 stars from me this issue is solved"
"The new update really messed things up. You can't choose a song from a playlist, you can only use shuffle play. Only 6 skip pre hour really ruins spotify. Really hope you fix this"
At 1st this app was amazing and i could listen to any music anywhere any time...but later on Spotify staryed adding songs to my playlist and i couldn't remove them.Also the app stopped letting me be able to choose which song i wanted to listen to and whenever i searched for a song it would just show me in which playlist it's in and not allow me to play it unless i were to click the play button to choose a random song and then i just have to hope i get the right one.
"it was fine on my ipad, im on my android phone and im trying to play one album and the shuffle is ruining everything. i cant turn it off. and i just finished adding songs to a playlist. there was a ""you added"" and ""we added"" like literally im just trying to listen to my playlist. please remove these. it's the most annoying thing ever."
Actually it's a very good app but when it comes to lyrics it is quite troublesome for past few months I'm not having access lyrics in Spotify but where as my brothers phone doesn't seem to have that problem please look into it
Not as good as it used to be. App is quite slow to respond to connection changes. Which is annoying. When it gets going it plays music as desired.
I do like this app but.....Shuffle play keeps bringing up the same songs in my playlists... Arrrg!!!!... Does not update from shazam even though accounts linked. Spotify too quick to remove downloads if monthly subscription does not process properly / immediately.... tried so many things to fix including deleting and reinstalling app. Im exhausted with these problems... and not using this app as much anymore.
I pay for premium but no matter how many times I reinstall the app I get crappy user experience. I have good 4G and great wifi. I listen to music too often to continue using Spotify with this kind of service. I have a Note 9.
"Cant listen to any of my podcasts now. The dumb speed button at 1x keeps skipping. Even if i change it to another and try to go back to it, it still doesnt correct itself. I mainly use this app for its podcasts and i pay for it. I just want to listen at normal speed!!!"
"I liked the app a lot until recently my dad paid the family subscription fee and I got kicked out of the family group. All I wanted was some of my music, but I was greeted with a big juicy ad. Hopefully they fix this issue, but until I see my dad I have to listen to your annoying ads. Please be careful of this issue when getting Spotify, in some cases you could loose some money."
I would have given it 5 stars but it is not working quite well on my samsung model.. it keeps on crashing and closes automatically.. more annoying than the ads. Please fix this🙏
"I boarded on my 6 hour flight. As we took off my phone slipped off my lap. I grabbed it quick accidentally undownloading 700 songs leaving me with no music for the entire 6 hour flight. Why would you even have the download button in that spot. Or the capability to get rid of all my songs with such ease. Please fix it, that an awful design."
"Works really well if you want to play some generic background music, but after quite a while the recommendations are still okish at best and finding new lists you like is actively restricted"
I have been using spotify for quite some time now But recently i have been having some troubles with the app Everytime i play a song and change the song without finishing it The second song doesnt play at all Only the time goes on unless i drag it and play it again from the begining
"Recently my spotify keep having problems!! It either cnnt react to the buttons i press on time, for example the pause button or just freezes even when the song has changed...."
Good music selection and device support. Awful UI as of the last update. Very difficult to organize and filter music in a sensible way or that supports being offline. Shuffle is poor. Bugs accessing and playing downloaded music with limited signal strength.
"I have been a premium user for almost 3years, i stay with spotify becauss of the feature of being able to flip my sounds output to another device like an amplifier and control it using my phone, except recently the app on the phone just quits working as a remote for my other devices and the app wont output anything, it is very hit and miss. Sometimes it works but the slider to show what song is playing or how much has played wont work on any song, its buggy as of late and needs fixing,"
"First off let me say, Spotify is great on its own. But I can't give it a good review until you guys fix the horrible family plans and duo plan, it's damn near impossible to use. Had to just quit it, it's especially hard across different mobile OS phones. Get it worked out guys, it's absurd the UX is that bad in 2020."
"Horrible! I used to use Spotify all the time, now after a brief hiatus from the app, its been completely ruined. If you don't pay a monthly fee, you get 5 or 10 skips per hour and the main app is very difficult to navigate. It feels as though it is made to annoy you into paying..."
I like the collection. But 2 things which really irritate the hell out of me 1. Why can't I add an entire playlist to a queue? This is there in all the music streaming apps. 2. Why don't you get at least 1 advertiser? I just came back to the free version after an entire year and I still keep hearing your ads. Is it intentionally done to annoy us and upgrade? It might just downgrade users to uninstall I guess since more collection is there on YouTube and better UX on Saavn.
Background downloads take priority and lock up the ui. Don't update without turning off Offline Mode. It is impossible to login again (why do I need to login again anyway?!) without uninstalling and reinstalling.
It's pretty cool but unlike soundcloud you can actually choose a song you want to listen to at that moment. And I also think it's pretty much useless unless you have a premium unless if you shuffle your playlist you created. And the ads are just out of pocket. Unless you have a premium ads will just ruin the vibe of you listen to music. Maybe take the ads out then I'll like it more
"Spotify India: showing music and podcast that I have not liked or in my interest. Forced pushing of content, lack of understanding of customer requirements. All the best, you should be able to close down this service in India very soon. Not subscribing again."
I don't why but my liked songs are empty I haven't made any playlists :'/ I can't even like any songs I if I try to open anyone profile to see their musics it than the app crashes music quality is reduced there is no bass if I hear same music on YouTube it had better quality you guys ruined the Spotify
"One of the best Ad streaming platform. I guess this is the first music streaming platform that streams Advertisements more than a Music. This app is best only for those who already own the premium membership. People download spotify to hear their favourite songs, but ads are just ruining their experiences. Now, don't get me wrong. You should put ads, but the frequency of an ad matter the most. Spotify Team should work on it, otherwise your competitors will. I used to love spotify😕"
"I'm paying for the ap and I have let go of Pandora. But I was disappointed with the podcast feature. It seems hard to figure out especially since i like listening to the last produced first. And i dont think that it goes from one to the next. I tried to contact to let them know. And it looks like its super convoluted to let anyone know anything. I could tweet, but dont quite like twitter. So, instead of letting them know personally, I guess i have to let them know publicly they arent great."
"Still doesn't have the feature to remove an accidentally disliked song. Very inconvenient. An app of this stature needs to have this ubiquitous feature, high time!"
"I like Spotify, but there is a thing that makes me mad😡 When I search for a specific song I want, for example, ""Soap"" by Melanie Martinez, I search it, I click the song, then it gives me another random song than the one I want.😡 It really annoys me to the point that I don't even want to listen to Spotify anymore... I'm quite disappointed ☹️"
I've been using this app for quite some time now and ever since the update it's not working right. I use it while my phone is connected to the bluetooth in my car. It won't show the next song and it doesn't start automatically anymore when I start my car. I didn't use to have to open the app for the songs to play. Can you please fix this?
Good until the update. Spotify was awesome and I loved it! I'm sorry to rate 2 stars but the update ruined Spotify. Even more limited and worse. You can't even let the song repeat anymore?! Please return it to the older version
It was good for the first 4 months and then it kept shutting itself off. It's not equipment failure It's not wifi apparently its some thing to do at there end.
Problems with songs displayed. Play one and displayed another. Play button showed that track on pause but it was playing. Very odd for the paid service to have such a buggy app
"They've ruined the app. You cannot listen to any songs you'd like to, you must play shuffle and hope the song you want comes on, which it usually does not. Never paying premium for something that used to be free."
"I'm using the free version and would gladly listen to ads rather than paying for premium. But recently, the removal of the preview or 'see more' button feature on artists and albums has really pissed me off as free users like myself really relies on it to discover new artists or some of their less popular tracks. I understand y'all are finding ways to make money but this ain't it. Please fix this Spotty."
"The UI of the app is feels old and the performance is poor. Ads everywhere, and less freedom. I literally have to use Premium to listen to my own playlist.."
"Easy to find a better app, highly overrated, 10 quid a month to listen to the music that I want to listen to and be able to skip whenever I want can't even see which songs I would like to play on an album before I play it. App shows free streaming and etc"
Its he but it's really buggy takes 5 minutes for a song to start after pressing the button I recently started having this problem abt 2 months ago the app is super slow I hate it I would recamend using another app like pandora etc. If they fixed this the app would be perfect has a huge selection of songs but these bugs just make me wanna use other apps
This new update has ruined Spotify now I can't listen to the song I want to I have to go through some dumb playlist and don't even get to choose the song.
"It won't allow me to view the artists I follow or search up. The app freezes instead and kicks me out. I don't know whether this is a glitch or I did it, but this is getting quite annoying."
Well overall spotify Is good but one thing that drives me nuts is they raise the volume whenever the commercials play. Its sucks because I will be working out then these loud no use commercials come on...so I give it 2 stars for ruining my ears
"Love the design, love the catalogue, absolutely hate that it freezes and doesn't load my playlists, songs and albums, even though all the other apps work perfectly well and the internet connection is ok. Guess I will be cancelling my subscription just because it's annoying to use it."
"Used it for 10 years, might stop. I make playlists for my friends and my moods, but their algorithm makes shuffling my 10k songs not-quite-random and I hate noticing the patterns"
"I had spotify for over a year ,I just suddenly lost my premium at 9.99 a month and when I made enquires I was told I only have the free account so will continue to get ads, it clearly says on my statement that I'm still paying ,it would be nice to have a voice at the other end rather than texting a complaint, I've cancelled it😡"
"The new update is annoying. The ""Queue"" button was replaced with ""Share"" which is inconvenient, especially since in order to see the queue you need to go into the options menu and tap on it. I think the queue access is more important than sharing a song. Please put the button back."
At first it was a great app I used it to listen to my new favorite song that's not on Pandora and songs from YouTube without having to watch the video i was just vibing to some music then I went to put it on a song and it just started to play random songs that were recommended that I didn't even know so I went to my playlist and hit play and then realized there was no shuffle button witch sucked but I got over it but I tryed to play the song from there AND IT ONLY PLAYED A SAMPLE OF THE SONG>:((
"I love the songs, but there are quite a few ads. And to listen to a certain song, you have to go through a whole big playlist just to find the one you wanted to listen to."
Casting to a device is awful! Volume somehow it's always Maxed out and when trying to adjust it the volume keeps bouncing and then goes back to max. Using the volume buttons on the phone helps some just to lower it enough to not blow the speakers.
"I have been useing it since 2012 and every update keeps making it worse. Its goten slow to load playlists both online and offline, it crashes a lot more then before, if you open spotify to fast after restarting the phone it will not see the sdcard and not recognize the songs so you have to download them again And they moved the button for looking and modifying the queue with the share botton so now you have to click more option thats at the topp of the screen and then open the queue."
"I do not like the new update. I've been using Spotify for about a month now, it was great, until this update. In my opinion, it isn't fair that you are required to have premium in order to play ONE SONG. Im trying to play MY playlist, but the app has recommendations. I've tried to delete them from my playlist, but more replace them. Spotify, please fix this."
this new update is trash.It makes you have 6 skips for a song PER HOUR I thought Pandora was worst but no Spotify was so but thats not it once you search up a song it takes you to an album it's annoying the only way too pas that is too get premuim I'm switching too Pandora.
"No, putting the like button right beside the play button is Not a good idea! Spotify is actively making the design choice so that people will *accidentally* remove liked songs. They are literally putting the like button right(or should I say left) to the play button. They are also slapping a like sign to every song in the liked list. I mean if it's already in the list, I don't need you to remind me I had liked the song at some point. What's next Spotify? Removing liked songs >1yo?"
Forced to find a new streaming service with Google Play Music shutting down. I find Spotify to be much more difficult to navigate and lacking some features that I used quite a lot with Google. The worst part about Spotify is how terribly it works with Bluetooth. Whenever I switch to a new Bluetooth device I'm require to force stop the app otherwise I have no audio even though I've disconnected from the other Bluetooth device.
"Great until it wasn't recently for some reason it stops playing midway through some of my songs. And when I press play, it starts the song all over again. Thought it was my headphones going bad but it happens when they're not connected and my connection is perfectly fine. Please look into this issue before your next update because I love this app for my music and would hate to have to move back to my built in music player on my phone. Update: still have to restart my songs due to random stops"
"I find it annoying when random songs show up on my playlist. I understand about broadening your music, but I think this should be a choice not forced on you. When I'm listening to a certain playlist for a certain reason, I don't appreciate a song I didn't pick start playing. If this is to figure out my song preferences, it doesn't work because I don't like the songs. Spotify is ruining my experience."
"It good, but the problem is there is no repeat button on mobile or my device for a song or playist and if you have only 5 song in a playlist there is other random that is put into the playlist."
"Spotify is a great app for listening to music, but I'm hating their newest update. The view queue button is in a very odd place now and it's really inconvenient to have it in the new location. Really wish they would put it back where it was :("
"It used to be great but with the latest update, the queue button has disappeared and I used to be able to show only certain language songs in my liked songs/playlists but that function has also been removed. The fact that updates are removing features instead of adding them is frankly quite worrying. I am starting to wonder why I'm paying for premium if the features are regressing per update..."
"I use Spotify a lot and the queue button used to be in the media panel but it was replaced with the ""Share"" button :( I don't like it at all, it's a little annoying.. may be sounds dumb but i got used to tap that button and not it takes me to the share panel, which takes some time to load."
"Used to be very easy to use. Now my music doesn't auto play. Even though I have it enabled. And whenever I create a playlist. Spotify adds other songs. It can ruin the playlist, especially if you need to have a playlist for a job or something like that. And the inability to just play one song in particular is very inconvenient."
"My repeat button doesn't show up, so I can never repeat the songs I want to. Also I'm tired of having to watch 10 ads after being told I could watch 1 short one for 30 minutes of ad free music. -_-"
I like Spotify but the latest update of the software for Android is really stupid. The queue button has been moved from the now playing screen to another screen 2 menus down. There is now a share button where the queue button was. Bad update! Now I need to revert back to last software. Spotify - please fix ASAP!
"Spority was a very great app for music streaming, this year sadly the algorithm is changed for creating a radio. First of all it is immensely annoying that the song you might choose to base your radio on isn't even in the picture Itself amd second ia that the music that presents the radio isn't based at all at what you chose to base it on, I used to be a big fan but now when I base my radio it might play an energetic song and right after, one quite more depressed tthusI may gonna delete"
I used to love the app I used it everyday It was working perfectly fine last night I had lots of playlists and downloaded quite a few albums and it never said anything about no space on the disc But for some reason today I was out and I went to play some music and when I went on the app it had logged me out and when I logged back in it had removed all of my downloads so I went to download everything again it keeps saying no space on my disc so I've had to remove lots of songs
The app does not function properly offline. The album is downloaded don't play at all. The UI is not user friendly.
"Where are the playlist control buttons ? Return those immediately to the now playing screen. I don't want the heart button or the minus button in the now playing screen. I saw in the help/support forum thread, that those buttons are shifted within the ellipsis menu (top right corner) but I can only access them when I'm using Spotify connect to play music on my smart TV. I get it that you need to sell subscriptions but nerfing the mobile app to do so, is such a lowly move. 🤦🏻‍♀️"
"Used to open, doesn't open anymore. Music stop loading quite a while ago. For some reason all the other apps requiring data run on the then current connection, but Spotify does not. Nothing loads, and after several installations, couldn't even log in for some reason."
In the last couple of months its started to crash constantly and can't download/ save all the song I want for some unknown reason. Quite disappointing
"All of the sudden my entire library is ""waiting to download"". It will take hours and hours to re-download. Yet, the app says I still have many days before I need to go online again. A friend of mine had the same problem and quit Spotify"
"Spotify was cool when I first subscribed(for like the 1st week)..then songs would stop and Id have to got the app to restart them. Downloaded albums would disappear. Most the albums wont even play in offline mode.""(Something went wrong)"" is wht pops up every time. This app kinda sux. Spend money on it at your own risk"
"I had this on my tablet which is also an android and it was great! I downloaded it on my Samsung Galaxy E10 and it didn't even have a replay button or shuffle. I am the type of person that likes hearing songs on repeat. I will raise my rating if you fix, over great app!"
"Love this but I'm kind of sad there isn't a desktop app for my Chromebook. I was trying to find a Spotify URI but it would not let me because I do not have the desktop app. I don't really care if I never get the desktop app, but I was wondering if there's a way I could get a URI from my phone? There doesn't seem to be a button for that. Help!"
"Can't ban a song from ever showing up on my radio. Landscape support is bad... Really bad, like the button to play a station is missing. Radio algorithms are also poor. Online version not mobile friendly."
It's quite a good app but the only thing is that if I try to play the song it stops on its own and would not play again. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it again n again. Wish they could fix what's happening cause the app is awesome and I wanna use it.
Opted out of the watch the ad for a free 30 mins and then it forced me to watch two ads and then asked me to watch some more ads for a free thirty mins and then I press the no thanks button again but still plays the ads. Whats worse is that they took away the timer away from the videos which doesn't tell us if the videos are really time for short ads. Anyone else forced to watch the videos?
"I have used the app for a quite long time now BUT i hate the fact that after each 2 songs there is an announecement. AND I hate the fact that you cant play one song, you need to shuffle a plyalist to hear it, in my Tablet u can actually hear one song but in my phone no, either in my friends' so can u please do something about these 2 problems?"
Used to love this app. Lately (even after uninstalling it and reinstalling) randomly my songs stop half way through and go to the next song on a play list. Quite annoying
"Still learning to work 0ut this phone and having to use pc with the WiFi wireless connection and the amounts I have to pay out each month for the lot, I live in the poor disability,? ""electric chairs and mobility equipment. So if you can recommend a decent amount of the lot. I have to do the exercise for Vodafone and spread the word out to all of the people that you've been there 4 everyone else in every way. Thanks for your help."
"I dont know why, but its not letting me pick out individual songsI wanna play, it keeps sayin I have to get a premium membership! Which I think is DUMB! It lets me pick out individual songs on my other devices like my tablet and laptop and I don't have to get premium for them! I have to buy premium to select precise songs on my phone! Not any other devices! I always have to try my luck by hittin the shuffle button now I have to make specific playlists for my phone!!! ;("
"Almost every update manages to make the app worse and more convoluted to listen to certain artists. A while ago it forced you to follow every artist you've downloaded a song from to make them appear on your library, and now it has ruined the 'various artists' option. It used to show all the songs from things like musicals, but now will take you to a page of ALL songs by various artists, and it breaks up musical albums into the individual singers for each track"
This app is a basket case on Samsung s7. It constantly disconnects from Spotify Connect and often gets stuck at the start of a track requiring a phone reset. Really irritating. I'm not getting what I'm paying for. When is this going to be fixed?
This app is almost forcing you to get premium. Even song skips are limited. Since almost every feature requires premium you might as well make it a subscription.
Keeps stopping in the middle of a song to the point where I have to go back to the playlist and start it over because the play button quits working when the music stops? I really like having spotify premium but this blows and only started a few days ago.
"Being back shuffle all songs, clean up the home screen. I use this everyday but genuinely considering canceling due to poor design. It's a muddled mess."
I've been having a lot of issues concerning connectivity. Constantly tells me I don't have an internet connection regardless of service and considering I pay for premium im quite disappointed
"I wish I could give 5 stars for such an amazing app but the app system just sucks. If you must give ads ,give them at the very beginning before I start my playlist. I was playing a gym music playlist while excercising when it started playing ads in the middle of the excercise ruining the mood completely. I dont mind ads but please limit it to the beginning or 30 minutes after I start listening please. Hope I can give 5 star again in future thanks"
"For a premium music app, the volume leveling across songs is rather awful and ear breaking. As an example (out of a thousand) Rehab & Valerie from Amy Winehouse. Also, I really wish a ""repeat 1 song"" functionality was added to external connected devices. Having to press ""backward"" or create a new play list to add that single song every time is frustrating, cumbersome and counterintuitive (to avoid stronger words that come to mind...)"
not compatable with non macbooks unabling me to do a lot of things like changing the cover of my playlists. Pisses me off how i only get 6 skips.Who makes that a feature just so they can get more profit??? So easy to find other apps that go offline like audiomack (used it but started glitching).Also cant find some songs i know. Only music app i know that has ads and what is with the extra songs?-ruins my listening.Also not letting you go back to a song or skip to a part of the song is so stupid!
This app is built into the Galaxy S8 and I'm not able to uninstall it has there's a problem with it. Occasionally the Spotify will automatically pause after you hit play and not work until you log out log back in
"Great music, but i just can't deal with the ads anymore- there have been more and more ads, consecutive ads between songs (the same one over and over), and the worst part- the volume of the ads is much louder than the music. Ill be listening to quiet music whilr studying, and suddenly they're blasting an ad in my ear. I put up with it for a while, since it's the free version. But I can't take it anymore."
"I don't like this app anymore cause whenever I click another song it changes another song example I click ""build up our machine"" it changes to a rap song plss fix this. app is a disappointment👎👎👎"
"The app is the same as on pc except one major thing that ruins it for me. On pc you can choose individual songs, yet on mobile you can only shuffle play. Thats why I rated it 2 stars. Not cool, spotify."
"After my Spotify premium account was hacked and they reset everything, my account no longer included my Hulu promo and they would not honor it. The app is also not useful for podcasts as there is no way to easily browse your subscribed podcasts. Why use the app if the UX is not optimized for all audio experiences, including podcasts"
"Limiting to shuffle play is less of an incentive to upgrade to premium than an incentive to ditch the platform. Ads and offline play are a great way to distinguish between free and premium, but that's a sufficient compromise without crippling free users. I'd prefer to buy music than a subscription if I have to pay either way, so mobile Spotify currently serves no purpose for me. I'm sure the app's fine if you're a premium user, but it's borderline unusable if you have a free account."
"Problems, all the time. I pay every single month and have non-stop problems with my downloads. For example, all of my downloads disappear for no appart reason; this is quite aggravating considering the fact that you guys brag about how we have ""downloads on the go"""
"Spotify used to be best but recently it's just been getting worse. Casting to Chromecast now rarely works, it just hangs a bit and then quits as if I never tried to cast, and if it works it keeps forgetting my shuffle/repeat settings. In the app itself after recent updates I can no longer long press to open the context menu, and if I have a ""bad"" connection (e.g. going from WiFi to cell) it can't load the menu so I can't queue local/downloaded songs until the connection is stable."
"This app have some kind of bug or something, it does not work on Vodafone network but always works on Airtel. It feels more like a tie up with Airtel than a bug 😅. It shows alot of ads like after every three song it plays 3 three ads but feels like there is ad then a song plays. That's why i am switching yo another app like which is quiet better in terms of ads."
It's ok but so many ads and when you want the music quiet it is but as soon as an ad comes along it's so freaking LOUD!!! For example your trying to sleep whilst lisening to your music quietly and as soon as an ad BAM!!! your wide awake and then its ad after ad and as soon as you think it's all over MORE FREKING ADS and some of the ads aren't even in the same language I'm only giving it 2 stars because it is well lade out
Stop adding suggested songs to albums and playlists because it's really irritating and it ruins the mood and you have to just leave the app for another day and I thought about getting premium but I never because I heard the same thing happening to people who have premium so please sort it out because I can't enjoy my music right now but thanks for reading and understanding. Oh and also I will change my review and rating if this gets sorted out thanks again
Used to be okay till a while ago. Unnecessary ads and multiple of them. Suitable only for listening to podcasts. Experience listening to music on this app is fairly bad. But I like the fact that you support struggling artists to post their work on Spotify!
"Whilst the overall construct is looking good. It seems the Devs at Spotify are now trying too hard in the graphics/suggestion engine department.Phone is being slowed down considerably,and the sheer size of the app is getting unwieldy for some phones. I simply do not need the level of pointers/suggestions constantly being thrown at my device.It takes up too much bandwidth-you open another app;and the phone starts seizing."
"Once you have liked or disliked and built a couple playlists, search for discover weekly you can't go wrong having that one downloaded. Edit:they broke the UI for building your own playlists."
"App is fine but they need to pay artists more. Also, it quits all the time in the middle of podcasts. Like I'm just walking, listening enjoying my day, and the app just stops. Lame"
"I was using the app, no problem. Then this popup came over my screen demanding I rate it. It came back every so often if i just dismissed it. It's a bit bothersome, especially considering I'm a premium member. So here's my review. The music is good, but the ads suck and the UI can be in your face about doing what Spotify wants. ""Here, listen to our playlist."" ""Hey, this live version costs us less in royalties so we are going to play that song instead of the original version."""
"Fine for music, pure garbage for podcasts. This app lacks a lot of the more advanced features for sorting, filtering, auto download rules, quick and easy playlist making, ""play next"", that many dedicated podcast apps have had for years. Very unfortunate that they are buying up all the most popular podcasts to put on their app without improving the UI. Hopefully they are working on it."
"Spotify. Continuing to earn it's 1 star review. At least one thing is consistent in these times of change. My payment method was flagged for fraud recently and Spotify sent a nice little passive aggressive notification saying, ""You've downloaded 13 playlists"""" ""DID YOU KNOW THAT'S A PREMIUM FEATURE""? Hey Spotify, did you know you're notifications are rudely worded?? Also, chill out. I know you just gave a huge amount of money to @joe Rogan, but that was your own decision."
"The amount of ads is insane. I'll get to listen to 2 songs, and then about 3 ads in a row. It's too much and genuinely ruins the experience."
PLEASE move the hide this song option further from add to playlist. Idk who designed this but why would you add that button right where the add to playlist was. I keep accidentally hitting it and having to find the song to unhide it. Also why isn't swipe to add to queue on Android?
"AMAZING except for one brain bashing annoyance. Why is the ""hide this song"" right next to add to playlist option? It's rare but extremely frustrating when I hit the wrong button. If this were fixed, I'd change my rating to 5 stars"
"Could you please change the position of ""hide the song"" button or add an ""unhide"" choice after the action? I think it takes the position of the original ""add to playlist"" button after the newest update. It's been twice that I accidently hide a song while I actually intended to add it to my playlist, and I can't even find the song back, which is quite annoying."
"the app keeps crashing for the past few weeks and it's irksome as the music keeps stopping as soon as the app is closed. please fix this fast. I hope you can keep the ads to a minimum, they've been getting more and more frequent than before and I think it's quite an issue for users who can't buy premium."
All of a sudden I can't create playlists or even open up albums. I click on things and nothing happens. It is that way on my phone and my tablet now. I have no idea why it quit working.
"10,000 song limit, that Spotify have never expanded, which then ruins the 'liking'/library growth. When you remove songs from liked library (I remove 1000s each year into playlists to make space in the library) it changes your recommendations. The user interface and song library has no sorting or filtering into albums. Max quality is 320bps MP3. The amount paid to artists per stream is pitiful. It has a great collection of music, just a pity that their business model is to neglect the experience"
"the app crashes all the time and stops playback for no apparent reason (battery optimisation is turned off) they have a lot of songs available, but many songs that i want to listen to are missing after the last update the ""artist search function"" in the library broke, reinstalling fixed the issue, but it happened again the general search function is a rather poor model so far i don't have an alternative, but as soon as i find one i will definitely quit using spotify"
I am sad to have to get rid of this app. Lately it keeps changing my settings so cant play offline and it continues to tell me I have to connect to the internet even when I am on my house wifi. Music quits playing over bluetooth. I have to constantly uninstall and reinstall the app to fix the problem. Not worth the hassle. I will save my $10 and go somewhere else😥
"I like it but it always connect to WiFi only, that's why I can't play my music if offline, please make the songs, music, etc. etc. offline if you play them. Before I was listening to my music (in Spotify) only one song is activated and I turn off my tablet and I open Spotify again, I play my song and it can't play, that's why my sister said. ""You can't play music if offline I'll just download Mp3 Juice"" she said if you save that song and play it offline, it works. (Sorry my English is not good)"
"I've been a premium user for years. The last update ruined this entire streaming platform. Crashes constantly after just a couple songs, will randomly stop playing but show that it IS playing, ""something went wrong, try again"" pops up every 15 minutes. It's trash right now and I'll be switching to a different platform until this app is fixed which I hope is soon because Spotify is the best."
Ok I love spotify but for some reason none of the songs end? The song cuts out and when I look at whats up I see the song is at the middle point now and doesnt play when i hit pause/play button. Yall have a bug or something
"It is not easy to use the app. Moreover the repetitive spotify advertising make me want to never use it again as they are repetitive, boring and stupid. How more redundant and stupid can an ad get than when it keeps ruining my experience by telling me how ""good"" the spotify experience is. As if they did not go out of their way to ruin it all they do things for no conceivable correct purpose like use my phone cameras."
"I have been using Spotify since I was 11, and I always loved it, but eversince the new update that we have to pay for premium membership to play whatever music we want to and could play on repeat, I'm quite disappointed. And the same time I couldn't afford premium so I had to switch to SoundCloud or joox."
"I have been using Spotify for quite some time now and I never had any issues but lately I am getting really annoyed, the app keep stopping for no reason. Can someone please fix this issue"
"After 10 years of being a big supporter of Spotify ( and have Premium) the past year its gone from simple, fast and fluid to extremely clunky, crashy and slow. What was instant now takes 10-15 seconds...and sometimes nothing at all ( press back and try again). Thought it was my old phone but just as slow on my new phone. I'm only guessing it's more bloated now having vids etc. It's a shame, come on Spotify please sort it out. 🙃. P.s tried everything...switching off phone, reinstalling etc."
"The one thing I **hate**, is every time I open the app it tells me I need to allow data in background and forces me to go to settings. And every time I go in setting and poke around I find that, yes, still and always I have background data allowed. If I'm connected to wifi (which I am most times I go to use it) this should *not* even be an issue. I'm paying for spotify. But I thinking about cancelling because this poorly thought out and unhelpful UX element is so infuriating."
"Buggy, crashes regularly, randomly pauses and skips songs. Also for some reason, both the 15 second forward and back buttons skip backward."
"Surprisingly disappointed. The music library is huge. However, it sometimes has a bug requiring me to restart my phone. The worst part is how bad it is at recommending me music. Like I have a playlist with 200 songs. 4 songs are by Rupaul, 1 song by Shea Coulee.But the recommendations are mostly other drag queens. Like the 1st 15 songs they recommend are other drag queens. My discovery is also over ran by drag queen recommendations.I don't understand why it assumes all I listen to is drag queens"
"I would give it 5 stars but the 'suggested songs' ruined my experience. I turned off auto play and still it's plays suggested songs. I Just want to listen to my damn playlist. How hard is that? I've seen complains about this since 2017,why hasn't it been fixed? Just please fix this problem that needs to be addressed. Please Once this is fixed I will rate 5 stars."
Temperamemtal. Decides when and which songs its wants to play. Simply ques up songs but doesnt plau them. Requires mandatory skip over. Very annoying.
"I used to love this app but lately it has been crashing abruptly after playing for a minute or a few seconds, even when there are hardly any other app running in the background. I have to close it, reopen and play the song again from the beginning. The recent updates have ruined my experience."
terrible artist view design and poor support for local files. I like this app for it's discovery and social features but it's not so great for managing your own damn music library
"For some reason, Spotify crashes quite often and when it does it puts the song back to 1 second, which is hugely inconvenient and my main issue. On top of this, much of the time when I'm listening to an album and turn my phone off, the queue will just delete and when I go back into it, it's in a slightly glitched state and I have to click where I'm up to on the album. I downloaded an apk of an old version of the app, and these problems went away. Unfortunately, it updated back without my input."
App closes when I get a text message. Gets super frustrating when I am driving. Which is mostly when I listen to Spotify. How can I stop this from continuing to happen?
I've started to have issues where nothing loads when I open the app. I have to open and close it multiple times before I can get anything to start playing. Quite frustrating.
"It was great at first, but after a while, the app disabled me from choosing the songs I want to hear and kept shuffling and playing them at random unless I go premium--which requires payment, and it's pushing me to uninstall it. If you're looking for an app to listen to any song of your choice for free, would not recommend this one."
DO NOT PLAY button missing ! I had purchased the premium plan and the do not play button that used to appear in every playlist is gone. Now that button is only available on some playlists if I tap the three dots option. Please fix !
For some reason when playing my recent liked playlist it will randomly start over from the top of the list instead of continuing to play the rest of my son songs. Very annoying and hard to find where I left off
"Constant lags in Android; it cannot play tracks offline as always it is trying to connect to the network which really really annoying, just super annoying; also, the app design seems like from 90's where is update for after more than 8-10 years? I was expecting to see it better than Apple Music, but it is not, when I joined Apple a few months ago. You need to do smth as you app is outdated really"
It keeps crashing whenever i click on option tab to access sleep timer... Annoying as it is occurring from last two updates and sleep Timer is seriously required often.
"I pay monthy for spotify premium and i usually dont have any issues. now everytime i play a song, it goes to the top of all my downloaded songs istead of the order i downloaded them as it usually does. this is quite frustrating because i have a particular order i listen to my music in."
Lousy at staying connected via app or bluetooth. Randomly drops connections. Not intuitive about suggesting new music. Expensive subscription.
"I get lost with the GUI too confusing... there is no shortcut to 'always on' in car view you must go back to home -> settings -> car view -> always on -> confirm... not nice when driving... and car view playlist menu is terrible. You can't choose nor filter the suggested playlist from home when you start the app... Anyway great and huge content, found almost anything (jazz listener), ads free with family account."
A recent update has meant downloaded podcasts keep pausing if the app is set to offline mode or mobile data is turned off. Sometimes the app quits completely. Other times the podcast won't play unless data is turned on and then off again. Hopefully fixed soon but I'm getting a different app for podcasts in the meantime.
This is a weird app I dont like how you need premium In order to listen to ur favorites of music they're are way other better apps that really dont require the money neither the ads in order for you to listen to your favorites of music but other wise the free music they offer I guess is ok.
"This app used to be amazing until they changed the layout, it's extremely difficult and unintuitive to browse your music library."
"Great Idea, horrible UI and app quality. The Spotify UI is the single most frustrating thing I have had to deal with in a long time. It is completely devoid of logic, things that look like buttons are static text and random static text appear to behave like buttons. Menu layout is a nightmare, hidden UI elements and the app is a HUGE resource hog (especially on the desktop version). Offline mode stoped working (downloaded songs)."
It keeps forgetting the already downloaded playlist. I have to keep downloading it. It's become a nuisance. So many times I have to keep logging back in when I never logged out.
So I would give 5 stars except theres one problem that actually completely ruins spotify for me and its that when I play my music if i go to my home screen another app or turn my screen off it stops my music and usually restarts spotify whats up with that i habe premium for no reason now because i cant even listen to my music
"Latest update just screwed up things that were working well before - controling music from a phone while playing on another device became poor. Randomly changing the playback device, disregarding the previous/next button (sometimes, so you never know if you should just press it twice), finally sound level control juat stopped working!"
"The Chromecast feature is buggy as all get out. It frequently forgets it's connected and plays my next selection locally; the volume control is jumpy and sometimes leaps to maximum; it can only be accessed on the ""playing"" screen, but you can only get to that screen after pressing play - therefore you have to press play, press pause quickly, press Chromecast, and then listen from 0:02 onward 🤦‍♂️"
"Had been a premium user for 8 years. However I am considering to quit now. As the feature of ""Set the same volume level for all song"" has been removed from this version of app. I understand this feature had a lot of criticism in the past. However it is an extremely crucial feature for me. Now every track has a different volume level. Some of them were extremely loud, thaymt actually caused a jumpscare while I was driving. Not good at all."
"Newest update at time of this posting has ruined the App for me. I'm a paid subscriber and since the update it takes in excess of 30s-1min to bring up music already downloaded to my library - if it even loads at all - which it shouldn't even have to because I'm in ""Offline"" mode - so there's nothing to load in the first place. Never a problem before and is quickly making the App unusable for me."
"It is a good app, but the update is not good. It previously had predesigned playlists but not now. Some famous songs are also not there which makes searching for songs more difficult task. On Google it shows that spotify has that song but when I open it doesnt or atleast I cant find them."
Update drops all our downloads and messed up my Podcasts so I could not see what I had already had watched 😡 we also seem to be having to turn on mobile data to get already downloaded media to play. I hope this improves as almost all our use is via the app and it is ruining our Spotify premium experience.
I dont know if its bugs or what but my music keeps pausing or stopping completely if my phone screen turns off. I have to press the button for the music to start again or after awhile the app closes itself and just stops. It's getting really annoying I used to like this app but this makes me want to delete it.
I love Spotify but the app ruins the experience i have a net with fair enough speed yet the app doesn't detect and I have to either force close the app or go airplane mode This has been become tiresome if this issue is resolved them I might go back to using prime music
"I'm not entirely sure if it is because of a recent update, or because my account is now premium, but the dislike button is now missing. This is a HUGE issue for me. There are some songs that I cannot stand, and not being able to prevent them from playing is ruining my enjoyment of the service."
"The app is quite slow, even on a great wifi connection or full bars on 4G LTE it can take ages to load. Also every now and then, songs will just pause, this can happen twice a song, this is very annoying. As I'm paying $17.99 a month, it needs to be a lot better. If this continues I will deactivate my account."
"Try, try and try again, these guys just cannot figure out a decent UI. The most recent update interrupted my playlist to tell me how easy it was to get to my playlists. When the promo was over, I wasnt able to go back to the playlist I was JUST listening to without searching for it again. Shopping around for google play/tidal."
I use the premium version and in the last couple of weeks it keeps stopping alone in the online and offline version. It's quite annoying!! Please fix it.
"I wish it was easier to have podcasts play sequentially. I only use this to play exclusive podcasts to Spotify. It is not intuitive to use, and does not work well with Android Auto. Everytime my current playing pod cast ends it plays the previous podcast, not the next one."
"I'm surprised by how bad the UX is. I'd only ever used Google Play Music which I'd certainly never thought of as being particularly impressive. However, I now realise just how lucky I was to at the very least have functional basics. e.g. a music queue that behaves like a queue (not a stack) and the ability to play an album without wondering whether you'll hear one song now and the rest later. I'm honestly a bit baffled. Spotify is a mature app; how did we get here?"
I'm trying to download one of the best groups all I want is there hit tracks OMD had a album called messages it had all their hits on one album but it's not there please can you put on all old albums on groups I did enjoy the old version of Spotify not this new version where you have deluxe albums sort this out send you may get a 5 again
"I enjoy it a bit, how you can make playlist of songs. But there are a few annoyences, like how some songs you can't listen to (I just wanna be with you- one of my most favorit songs.) And how you con only listen to songs by shuffle and not go back to a previous song. And the continuess ads, like the ones that say you get 30 min free, or the ones that tell you about premium. I just hink it eould be better if we could chose what songs we wanted to listen to at the time, and the back button."
"This used to be my favourite app hence why I decided to go premium. But since I have updated my phone to galaxy A51, I have been having problem with the app when connected to bluetooth whether it is to my car or to my speaker. It will play a song and sometimes it would go without problem for a couple minutes then suddenly the sound will start cutting off for a second or two which honestly ruined the song and it was much worse with podcast. I was hoping the last update would fix it but no"
The most recent update messed up big time. Why do I now have to open the app to pause a song or to do anything for that matter. It is very annoying. And addibg the covers to songs is just a distraction really. I still need to read the title to figure out what I'm listening to. It doesnt make selection quicker
"First and Second 🌟: Just awesome playlist! Great plans and soothing UI! Reduced 🌟: App crashing, cannot create playlists inspite of being premium client."
"The app crash regularly. Struggle to connect to my different devices. Since the last update, finding the music you vwould like to listen to is way less intuitive."
no skipping possilbe which really takes the fun out. A lot of advertisements which is fair but mindblowingly annoying as they're allways the same. Playlists created can only be heard on shuffle ... quite frankly YouTube is way better
"Every time they update or add something to the app, it breaks something else. Right now I can't pause my music with my phone locked. I can play it after its paused, but the pause WONT work while my phone is locked. The button just does nothing. Also it turns off my bluetooth earbuds for no reason. I dont have an issue with them except from spotify. It's so annoying having to turn them back on, then open my phone to get it to play again.. even premium does it.. dont spend money on this app."
"I hate the ads. UI design is meh. UX is OK. I really dont like how you have the ""mini ad"" about premium in the bottom bar. There is a way better competitor called Amazon Music, which is also free, has NO ads and you can download tracks- FOR FREE. Only downside is that some songs you have to pay for. So your decision to run your app off ads isn't a good idea. (I AM NOT SPONSORED BY AMAZON OR AMAZON MUSIC)"
"Spotify has some good spots, I'll give it that, but I'm not gonna pay almost 10 $ a month just to get rid of ads and suggested songs. Ads I get - some people just can't stand ads (and I'm partly one of those people, yet I can at least tolerate them) - but suggested songs? Why does Spotify, and only Spotify, gets to dictate what we listen to? Why can't I enjoy (for example) game OSTs without tracks from a different game coming in to ruin the experience? Use Spotify for podcasts."
It randomly pauses for no reason and i have to wake my phone to get it to play music and this happens on downloaded music and music that requires internet and it will restart my song and pause it at like 1 or 2 seconds for no reason please fix this I have premium and it still does it
"Since the new update the shufle button is not even working it's just pauses the song and when i shuffle the playlist it will give me the same song,please revert to the old version atleast in this part."
"The free version got really bad because of the new update. Instead of just shuffle play and periodicly ads, now you can't even play just a part of the song, and if you don't have any skips left for that hour (six skips) you have to endure the pain and listen the song until the end. However, with premium is much better, but it's not worth the money. This app was one of the best music platforms, and now it's ruined. It's not that bad on pc, but if you want to listen on the go, just use YouTube."
"I think the title is quite misleading, it is not a free app actually.. I can only listen to my favourite song for 3 days then at the next day it pop up with suffle play which I can't choose to hear my favourite song anymore, not to mention that the ads will pop up after 2 songs playing, and some unknown song will played right after my fav group song:( It is irritating and I uninstalled it already"
I love Spotify and would give it a better rating except that the download song button is directly under the shuffle play button. I have had to download my songs so many times...
Add the ability to slide down on your liked songs list to search a song within your liked songs like you do on iPhones. Not fair that we have to press the 3 dots menu button on the top corner and then click on search.
"I like the central app. Easy to use and navigate. Downgrade by 3 stars for removing the widget. The widget has always been the entry point to spotify to me, now your little app Icon is just a random little Icon amongst so many others. No idea why you killed it. I hope it has nothing to do with design aesthetics or a try to ""streamline your development efforts"", but actual usage numbers and hard data. For me the removal has made the spotify experience remarkably worse..."
"It is impossible to clear the lock screen status bar. You just have to wait until it goes away. Closing all apps+clearing RAM doesnt work. When connecting to my car bluetooth, Spotify automatically opens. Its unclearable lock screen buttons (play/pause, next, etc) jockies for position with my podcast player making difficult the simple task of hitting the ""skip forward 10sec a few times because the spotify buttons displace the oodcast player buttons and then go back. Theres no shuffle all option."
"I have had and paid for Spotify for around 5 years. The UI fiasco is something I still can't forgive. The old UI was much easier to manage, and work with. The new one is absolutely horrible. I'll be using old versions of spotify until it is fixed."
"Good app, but a lot of the service is quite appalling on Android, just an example is how your downloaded songs on many occasions will not load until you are online, despite the fact that they are DOWNLOADED! This is the most irritating thing to face when your simply trying to listen to your music, please fix this feature!"
Review for Podcasts not music. I love that Spotify is getting serious about podcasts and have no problem with them getting exclusivity on some of my favs. The problem is you cannot operate your podcast playback like you handle music. I think Spotify should look at some really good podcast apps like Pocketcasts or Stitcher or many others (not apple or google podcasts) and model their podcast area after these apps. The functionality for podcasts is very intuitive and easy to use.
SO ANNOYING! WITH THIS NEW UPDATE I CAN'T EVEN PLAY A SINGLE SONG FROM MY PLAYLIST. Before I was able to but now with the stupid new update. If I want to hear one song in particular I can't. I can only mass shuffle my list and hope it lands on the song I have in mind. The update ruined this once amazing app.
"Not all songs are present, autoplay is not good, search needs you to put the exact words which doesn't work well for hindi songs, unsubscribe button is not present in the app."
"Buggy! Couldn't add songs to playlist from search result directly, the plus button has no effect. Had to be added from artist or album, which involved many extra steps."
Rubbish app (4/10 - Android) (8/10-iOS). Spotify over many Android versions and devices (last 4 years) has been a pathetic excuse for modern app development (probably purposefully). Playing over Bluetooth rarely works if app is in background (not asleep). All due to the fact 'Spotify' wants you to bring the app to the foreground to dismiss a popup or even just to press the play button!. To hell if I'd pay for premium when the free app doesn't work properly!.
My app repeatedly tells me I'm listening to a different song or podcast than I am. The pause play button and forward and backward buttons do not work properly. I have a Galaxy S8 Active. Please fix.
"New ui is borderline unusable. completely unintuitive and absolutely a downgrade from the previous layout. Along with this the new update comes with a myriad of other problems, download songs you haven't listened to in a while will not play in offline mode. And there is a strange glitch where an album is separated into smaller albums of the same name with just a couple songs from the album each on the artist page."
Please dont put the heart button next to the play/pause button when the player is minimized. Its quite annoying since you could accidentally unlike a song and not realize it.
"Was happy with the app until recently, seems to be quite temperamental now. Spotify needs to remember that there are a lot of other similar apps out there now. Premium subscriber - not sure for how much longer though."
I've been using this since a year (premium member). But now i m bore with the same interface and repeating same songs. I suggest you to please upgrade some UI ANd make some good suggestions ❣️
I'm having an issue with the app whenever I play music It always gets paused when the screen is locked or asleep . I'm a member for this app. I need help and guidance at once.
"Well built and famous application when it comes to music streaming. I have a big issue with in app false advertising though. For the 3rd time now the app presented me with a message ""watch this quick video and enjoy 30min of music without interruption"". Which seemed like a fair deal to me. Except that after thoroughly viewing the videos, I still get an audio ad every 3 songs or so. For me this looks like a way for the company to make more profits from the users with false promises."
"Super slow and choppy playback. Quality ain't great as well I mean, if Amazon music can play higher quality music in the same network, I don't understand why Spotify isn't. Also, how do I discontinue the subscription? It's not easily accessible. This is a dark UI pattern. Hiding the option to stop subscription is very sneaky in my opinion. Do you think people will stay in the subscription because you made it harder to reach it?"
"""Shuffle Play"" is the default play option on albums, which is horrible. Even more horrible is their separation of ""NEXT FROM"" (when you play a song from the album) and ""NEXT IN QUEUE"" (when you add to queue), the latter having a higher priority and both making it a pain in the ass to chain a few albums together. Also, it doesn't react to play signals from headphones after being idle for too long. Oh and then there's the times it forgets internet exists, requiring you to kill and restart the app."
"It's almost impossible to just play the song you want. Controls are unintuitive, and there is no way to just play an album. All the app has is shuffle play. You can't even pick a single song to play from an album because all you get is a 5 second preview. Terrible execution."
"I pay for premium service, yet the app will stop playing songs unless I'm actively engaging my phone. Guidance says to change settings in my phone (done), or to uninstall and reinstall (done x100). Needless to say, this is getting really old to pay for a service and it be unusable. Ohhh and absolutely no customer support -ask the community instead. What am I paying for?"
"Use to work perfectly now the screen freezes but continue to play music. Poor placement having the like button right next pause and play when dragging the screen down, I keep deleting song unintentionally. Ask for confirmation when removing songs from like list so annoying having to add an old song you deleted and its right at the top"
"New update is dissapointing, the main features people love about spotify, the best things about it: gone. New update is horrible, if we want to use a music app that wants us to buy premium just to pick and unlimitedly skip songs then we already have pandora for that, spotify is ruined with this new update. Very dissapointing, fix this or you're going out of buissness soon. -From a loyal user, that is very mad 😤 :("
The dislike button seems ineffective. The so-called created for me playlist are never songs I like. I wish there was way to avoid vocals and opera when listening to classical or jazz.
"Why don't phone users have all the abilities that other devices do?! For example, you can choose which song to listen to on other devices whereas you only get a preview on phones. Other devices have a repeat button while phones only get shuffle play. It's still OK, but you need to make it equal for all devices (and I mean add repeat button, song choosing and non shuffle play on phone, not remove features on other devices) and this will be five stars. (I'm a Free user.)"
Out of no where your music stops playing. It's quite frustrating. More frustrating than adds. Very unfortunate. I liked the Spotify before last year. It didn't do that to me. Idk what the problem is now but now it's becoming very irritating and ruins anytime you want to relax with music.
"Now playing - no horizontal view, makes ux awful as I use my phone on stand most of the day having to rotate it every time I want to operate this app. After update - shuffle and repeat are turned off, updates are done in the background and it always gets me by surprise when I notice it."
"Always nagging with stupid emails and notifications. Entire UI got screwed up and it constantly adds their ""recommended songs"" that I dont like onto my playlists even though I selected the option to avoid this. I used this app only a few times a week and now I use it a third of that. I swear every setting appears to do nothing because I mess with them and literally nothing changes. 2 star over 1 star because I can listen to music with the app closed w/o paying *cough, cough youtube music*"
I think this is an app designed by geeks for geeks and not for music listeners. You have a cluttered screen that does not allow interaction with the tracks.
It was good before the newest update. Taking out playlist organize and ugly UI. I mean all I want to do is organize my playlist by artists but thats not available anymore
Persistent bugs. Missing features that would be very easy to add and would make the user experience 10x better. Considering dropping it.
"Now I'm currently using three months free trial. This app seems to be slow in searching and loading almost of time, so I might reconsider whether to pay after trial. Plus, pause and play button issue here are also freaking annoying. Really miss the old Spotify... if the issues fixed, I'll give you 5 stars"
"I pay a monthly fee and receive a buggy app, with bugs that didn't change in the last 6 months. Examples are Search and getting album details, sometimes crashing, not aware of mobile internet connection re-established. Tested in 2 smartphones. The UI/UX is also lacking. I need 2 taps in small areas just to Start to search. Then I search the surname of one favorite artist, the artist does not appear in the results! Also, No Next Track button in the main screen, I need to open a sub screen."
"since the most recent update, unless I pause the music and the quit, Spotify keeps ""trying to play"". I have to open and quit like 5 times each time..."
"I just subscribed and assumed such a big company with a strong brand name would have a solid, stable app - but this thing is so buggy. Have they fired the QA team? Problems include: - Constantly saying it's offline when other apps are working perfectly fine. - Screws up controlling Chromecast devices. 9 times put of 10, I find myself having to restart the app and wait 30-60s for Chromecast to work again. App UI seems good, but searching for specific albums is impossible."
"Disastrous!! It's a very impossible mission to be able to play a particular song! It's a dream that you can easily arrange your playlist (if you managed to play it without shuffling in the first place) You search, you find your song in front of your eyes, but it's in your dreams that you can play it with a simple click!! You should go here and there, upwards and downwards to find the button for play or the button for the songs in the playlist.. and yet you will not find them PLEASE fix this!!"
"Switched a few weeks ago and I'm not impressed yet. No album art in playlists, no landscape mode, and overall just not intuitive like Google Play Music. Maybe in time..."
Good service but the app is dreadful. Im using samsung note8 with an extra memory stick and this app runs so god damn slow. Crashes quite frequently skipping between songs sometimes doesnt work and just freezes resulting in having to close the app (to which the music is still playing) and re open which also takes about 3/4 minutes to do. Please optimize this app its painful to use considering cancelling service.
"Android version is super buggy and less user friendly! Switched from Apple to Andriod recently and since then Spotify is on another level, and not in the good way. - often stops playing when phone locks. Only unlocking over and over, or force stopping solves that - it's way easier to miss buttons or to hit the wrong one - it now takes 3 steps to search for a liked song, instead of just scrolling up - pausing on the lock screen often doesn't work - sometimes scratchy / buggy sound"
I really liked Spotify. Too bad they disabled the 'dislike' button. At first I could listen to a playlist and make small adjustments to keep songs I didn't like from playing. Now it looks like if a playlist has some songs I don't like I have to find a totally different playlist..
"For the past month or two I have been experiencing very annoying issues with the application being forced to even reinstall the app (because deleting the data/cache weren't helping). No internet connection message popping up way too often (i have great data speed), UI stuck to the same song and had to reinstall to see what song I was listening to and quite some more. Paying for this app monthly for about a year now makes me want a stable application at least."
"Quite astounding how Spotify, a paid service, manages to create such a dysfunctional app. Connection issues, slow loading times, crashing and an unintuitive interface. (Especially for users that prefer to listen to albums instead of podcasts or playlists). Basic customization options would be welcome."
"This app has gradually started to go downhill. It is irritatingly slow. Just trying to find new music is painful. It takes forever for even one single to load that I just give up. It is starting to look like I need to find an alternative as I want something that is quick & reliable, especially since I use the paid service not the free version. Also, things ""downloaded"" to my device should not have the lag it does. No point in downloading if it isn't ready at an instant in offline mode."
"I would give it a better rating if it actually played the song I'm trying to listen to, it only played it for about 5 seconds then stopped now, it doesn't even play the song it is just quiet. Terrible. It won't even play other songs."
I used this quite often but becoming less and less since it probably plays 2 to 4 songs before automatically cutting my music off. I'm not one for reviews but since it's happened about a thousand times now...Premium?! Right!? Doubtful!
"The app is so frustrating, I hate the new update. I can't even play the songs i want it to play, and when I shuffle the playlist it plays the exact same song and I cant even push the playback button. And when it plays all my songs it goes to another one and wont let me play the songs I want it to play. FIX THE FRICKING APP I HATE THE NEW UPDATE!"
The updated search features are terrible. It's far less intuitive and much more difficult to find something different. It seems more like an attempt to put certain music in front of people...
"Unintuitive and poorly organized settings. The app randomly goes offline displaying ""No internet connection"" until killed and restarted. Switching between wifi and mobile networks doesn't resolve this problem. The playback randomly stops in the middle of a song. If the playback is interrupted with an incomming phone call and the headphones or external DAC is disconnected it will continue to play after the call ends through the loudspeakers, which is wrong."
The app took away the function to be able to sort artists by those that you have downloaded. For what point? Now when I'm on the tube I have to click on each artist to see if I've downloaded them or not. Theres also quite a few glitches here and there.
"Crashes often. The app will randomly go offline despite having an Internet connection. It has some nice gimmicks like a summary of your year, but the core feature (playing music) is not great. Overall disappointed with the user experience."
"One problem: too self aware ads. Seriously, the Spotify adds promoting premium are so obnoxious I can't help but to roll my eyes in disappointment. One problem that ruins this app for me"
"Listen, it's good for listening to music n all. But it's really annoying when you have to get premium, which is 10 quid per bloody month, to simply listen to songs freely and not have to shuffle it a million times to get to the song you want. Plus, I don't want things that I didn't add in my playlists."
"Chuggy, frustrating performance. Often requires restarting just to display songs I have supposedly downloaded. Pretty much a garbage app that I use out of pure laziness. I will likely replace it soon. They pay artists virtually nothing, so I still buy the stuff I listen to a lot."
"Some of the app works okay, but for instance if I try to use the family mix it just gets stuck on the 'Welcome to family plan page'. Found a forum post with other users having the same problem (Family Mix not working on Android v8.5.32.889) but unable to login with 'Email verification required ||${emailAddress}||' when already logged in in the top right. All seems really quite buggy and unusable and unable to get in touch with support because the help pages are buggy..."
"Android, S9+ As a user, you can choose between music and podcasts. Great. Not so great: it takes anywhere between 30-90 seconds for the podcast UI to load. Internet speed makes no difference. (Exception: downloaded content)"
"Play the music I select as I want to hear it. Quit forcing your suggested music into my choices, quit forcing shuffle in the playlist. The predictive feature will yield this prediction... I'll stop using Spotify AND will tell others of my experience. Just about had enough of Spotify thinking they know more about what I want to hear than I do."
"Connectivity issues compared to similar apps plus if you're not a premium member it's practically IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy this app. The ""made for you"" algorithm is also not good enough and quite exhausting. To conclude - NOT RECOMMEND at all. There are better alternatives."
"fix the heavy rotation , whats the point of a feature when most of the time it tells you information thats constantly out of date? by the end of the month when its fully updated it turns to the first and the last 3 things youve listened to are featured. love the app but that and a overall ui design that clunky while smooth. it feels like their agorthims are built to have 5 plus playlists of curiated muisc when the first 3 songs are the only ones not from radio"
"This app has been great up until the past 3 months I've had the app continuously say ""no internet conection"" that stops me from playing any music. And also crashing on me over and over. Its super frustrating and is making me think of different options. If it keeps on continuing I will be cancelling my subscription."
"I have had this app and been paying for thos service for like 5 years now. I have all of my song on here and keep updating the list over and over because I love the app and how easy it is to use. I'm so frustrated with the way it works now. I cant listen to full songs. It stops, cuts out or closes itself. I've tried updating it, uninstalling and re downloading and installing. NOTHING has worked. At this point I'm ready to delete it quit paying for the broken app with all my songs and restart."
İ have an s10+ and i am a premium customer but for some reason the songs stop playing in the middle then continuing a couple of minutes later or the app will shut off.(The songs are not being streamed they are already downloaded on the device). İ ve been waiting a couple of months for an update to fix this but nothing... i already gave them more then a few months if this issue doesnt get resolved im planning to cancel my subscription and also the spotify subscription i pay for others.
Always loved this app Been premium user for several years now.. but for some reason the playback will just stop randomly now after my phone locks. Just pressing the volume up/down side button or the lock button seems to make it go again but for a device I pay good money for this is BS. what's going on? Are you doing anything to address this? It isn't the first incident of weird playback issues like this. I'm about to unsubscribe it's so annoying.
"I have to launch and close the app 5-10 times before it goes online. Good signal in my area, everything else that requires internet works, except Spotify."
"Doesn't always work as it should. Random muting was a problem for a while, now it doesn't recognize a change a change in network without restarting the app as songs you haven't download become unavailable. Wrapped button doesn't work in the app. It is something I pay for and shouldn't have so many issues all the time."
"This app gets progressively worse with each update. In 2019, I've seen the UI get more convoluted and the functions become broken. - To search for a song in 'my songs' now takes two taps instead of the persistent bar that could always be reached at the top. - Some artist names are cut off on their profiles or separated despite being one word. - My OFFLINE songs won't play without an ONLINE connection. This is BASIC stuff Spotify. Fix your awful app."
Issues with connection. In a 5G area with at least 3 bars of coverage. Update: still having issues with connection. Play or pause button doesn't work from lock screen. Music wont play when opening the app. I have to close out and restart to get it to do something. Please fix.
"Constant network issues. While the rest of the system can reliably connect to whatever remote on the internet, Spotify claims there is no internet connection. To make matters worse, it refuses to display my last device-local state (most recently played etc.) before it connects to the backend. I'd much rather pay for a service that focuses on reliability (these issues are rather long-standing) rather than the odd UI-revamp, while forcing use of buggy clients by arbitrarily stripping the web UI."
"Used to be great but very glichy lately. App freezes while playing a song and I can't get it to skip or go back or even get it to stop playing. Twice, recently I have had to shut down my phone as I can't even get the music to stop when I shut the app using the home button on my phone."
"The app used to be great. I never write reviews for anything, but I'm getting frustrated with how long this app has been buggy. Every other day the app decides to pause mid song if my phone is unlocked. It's not just me, lol at every other comment below and above me for the last 6 months. 50% of the time quiting the app entirely and reopening works, the other 50% of the time I have to use another app because having to unlock your phone every 30 seconds sucks. How much longer to fix this issue?"
"I love spotify. I have been using premium for a couple years now I think and ive noticed, that for some reason, I got charged quite a bit for just a single device. I want to know why I got charged 17 dollars when a family plan is 14 and im used to paying 10. Its on my bank statement for every month until recently"
Selection leaves a lot to be desired. But the worst part of everything is there not being a thumbs down button so the app can't learn your taste. I regret leaving you tube red.
"I use this app quite often which is why im sad to say its been almost unusable these past few days. It logs me out everytime i close it, and only plays the first 11 seconds of songs, and always says im offline even when im connected to wifi,,,,(ive already tried resetting my phone)"
"I loved this app but latest update has ruined it. I've got an android phone, music cuts off at random times and doesn't play through (It isn't signal related) and occurs on Wi-Fi and mobile data. Usually on Bluetooth to my car or head phones (both brand new). Revert back to last update!"
App stops unexpectedly and music restarts only after pressing on/off button (Samsung) or works only by keeping the screen on all the time. Really annoying.
So annoying...I've been a customer for 3 + yrs. Recently Spotify quits playing randomly in a variety of situations. Tried all the online 'fixes'.
Love spotify but lately it has been so buggy to the point that I've been considering changing platforms. If my phone is set down and playing music it stops and only starts again if I press a button or otherwise start using my phone. This has been ongoing for quite some time and about 4 updates later it's still having problems. Not feasible to keep using spotify when playing music is literally it's one one job.
"The music is great, but the app has always been quite buggy for me. From a Pixel XL to the OnePlus 7 Pro I'm using now. Mostly, clicking a track does nothing for the first few clicks."
"Had to reinstall the app after my music suddenly started transferring from SD storage to internal storage, causing my phone to freak out and crash the app constantly. Now I have to download 30GB of music again. Fix your app. The reviews are right, lately user experience has been poor."
"I loved spotify, that is, until I got an android, now my bluetooth devices all play music at low volume levels and it sucks. Im fine with plugging in an aux, but giving up the already bluetooth stuff I have shouldnt be necessary."
i think you need to fix stuffs. because whenever i go premium i never be able to tap on 'option' button and it always crashed. it never happen when i use the free version.
"Not great for podcasts. Podcasts don't sort. In fact, the button doesn't even work. Quite the pain when trying to catch up on podcasts but the default sort is most recent first; don't want to watch things backwards!"
"Please, please move the 'download songs' button to somewhere else. It's too easy to push and every time it happens I have to redownload 2,000 songs (literally)."
"After the last update, the offline mode toggle button for android is gone and audio keeps crashing(notification says it's playing but it's not and you have to restart the song/podcast)."
"Good selection. I know it's free but getting bombarded by ads every few songs and constantly harassed to a ""free trial"" knowing that unsubscribing from the paid service is difficult(but counting on people forgetting or getting too frustrated) is making me consider uninstalling it from my phone. I wish there was an option to say"" I am more than happy with my current account please quit trying to force me"" after posting this I got 3min of ads b4 I closed the app to stop them!😤😤😤😤😤"
I cannot listen to a song only a preview. The shuffle button does not play my song; The list is not working either. I see other song which I don't want. This app is just dumb.
"Great service for a fair price. However, Spotify refuses to write proper patch notes and the new UI is not user-friendly. The 'liked songs', which is a key feature of premium, are now hidden away in the app and that's a shame. Plus no patchnotes.."
Theres this problem i have been haveing with spotify where the music stops and wont continue until i hit the play/pause button like 5 times and also when i have it playing music in the backround every time it plays a ad it stops and i have to reset the app.
"Unable to confirm my address, tried different combinations but the address shown once I clicked the find button is different. Then, in my sister's phone, everytime she plays a music, it will always stop at 9 sec. I had her try to reinstall, clear cache, logout from all devices (using the one found in account settings). It will always revert back to the 9sec auto-stop."
"The app is frustrating, since the new upgrade the widget just cuts out ALL the time! This happened once before after an upgrade bit was quickly fixed. It's now been going on fkr a few days :( please fix it!"
"Service was/is great, app WAS great, new UI was released and now app is terrible. Regularly unusable, takes 10 minutes to load my library, even when I have full cell service and/or a strong wireless connection. Put back the old app UI, 10/10. As is, 3/10 at best."
"I like listening to songs on spotify, but can you please add in the on and off button for the shuffle play button? Its very annoying to hear the songs i dont want to listen to."
"This new Spotify update can die. After being a satisfied customer and user of Spotify and it's services for two years I am severely dissapointed in it. It just took it's completely easy and balanced UI and threw it in the trash, Lit it on fire and stomped on it. it's so bad to the point where it's somehow ruined my listening experience. I used to recommend spotify to my peers as a fantastic and easy to use service but I will no longer do so. You have dissapointed a loyal customer Spotify."
The updates have changed so much that my Samsung s10+ does not play continuously on a premium account held for 2 years. I have to continue to press play when I ever I choose to use it. Suggested fixes require me to change settings on my phone which I should not need to do as I require maximum battery life on a daily basis. Why should I compromise settings just because you can't rectify a problem that exists amount thousands and thousands of users!!! Not happy.
App is very glitchy when connected to Bluetooth speakers. It will cut out but the song will still be playing and will not start again unless I press the pause button. There is no Spotify support either so I'm not sure who to contact to report this bug.
"App is very unstable - it never fully crashes but insists on summoning a bout of dementia when trying to initiate any functions on the app. Usual culprit is Spotify trying to find ""offline results"", despite the device enjoying a continuous 100MBps connection. Feels quite silly for a flagship music service."
"Ive been using spotify for awhile and I do love it. But lately, the songs just stop. There's no reason as far as I know. The only way I can get it to play is by pressing the pause button, which starts the song over and it will stop midway again, or to just move on to the next song. It's very frustrating. Hopefully it can be fixed soon."
"i love spotify but please fix the problem where the music is constantly cutting out. i removed my AOD (always on display) (samsung galaxy s10+) and uninstalled spotify, reinstalled and then put AOD back on again. this worked for an hour or so but now it is cutting out again. the music stops everytime the phone goes into sleep/stand by. the music starts again once the phone is reawoken (picked up or button pushed). problem is that when you uninstall spotify your entire downloaded library is lost."
With this new update you cannot see the album songs. You can only see shuffle play button but not songs.I even try reinstall the app. Ain't paying product what is not working properly.
Has a massive and new bug with my Sonos Play5 and jacks the volume anytime I reopen the Spotify app from my Android device. Almost scared to even use the service at the risk of my ear drums and my sound equipment
"New update is horrible, I have had Spotify for ages and I would have given it 5 stars if this new update didn't ruin it. This whole month I paid for and I've been able to listen offline ONCE in this whole month. Not happy at all. The poor Spotify team have tried their best bless them which I am very grateful for but just fed up of not being able to download music even though I have paid for premium."
"Would like a way to select multiple tracks and move them at once, would make building playlists much easier, and it's annoying that they don't give an update log in the google play store, that just seems lazy."
"App 'not responding' whenever I press the 3 dots/more button on a song. Therefore cannot create/edit playlists, go to song radio, etc... Very frustrating."
"App gets killed in background! Didn't expect this from Spotify. Also, if you restart the app.. the song progress is lost and you have to listen to it from the start. #UXFailure"
Your app is clearly broken. I'm playing on android and it cuts out intermittently when the screen is locked. This ruins the experience. This has put me off paying for any services.
"Everytime the app updates I'm unable to log in for a couple weeks. When it works it's fine. Plays good music, but it's not very intuitive to use."
"I used to love this app but after the recent update I've just found it confusing. Now when I play music sometimes it'll play songs that aren't even in the playlist. I also used to have the premium version and that version was wonderful, I had no problems and I was able to listen to music when out and about. However it was quite expensive, and that's why I stopped. I found the previous version of Spotify much easier to use and now I don't think I'll be using Spotify anymore. Please fix this :(("
Spotify needs to stop trying to fix what isn't broken. The past two updates have changed the UI a bit to make me have 1-2 extra taps just so I can see what song is playing when I'm in the app and I've had an issue where Spotify just decides to stop playing a song out of nowhere.
"I love the music streaming service but the app is terrible. It has not crashed on me but the user interface is not easy to use and since the latest version the ""hero""-display of the current track is gone. I want to give more starts but with the current UI I just can't."
"Bought premium after experiencing Free version. I was quite disappointed. On my J8, offline songs used to download everyday consuming lot of data. When tried on other device, I was logged out and couldn't log in. It prompted that Spotify was in offline mode, try logging using email link. On using the link, it said the link has expired, try again. Reinstalling the app deletes all the downloaded songs and few GBs worth of data."
Been paying for ages for a subscription. Great music but the app keeps getting slower and slower. There is so many GUI bugs and crashes. Slower devices of mine struggle to even load the bloody interface sometimes. Sometimes is even unresponsive on my Galaxy S9 and doesn't play my requested tracks on fast internet. There is so many bugs where it won't pause or play. The behind the lyrics likes to get stuck in front of the controls as well.
"Love the app - this rating is based on issues I've been having for a few months now. I pay for premium, and quite often, when my phone locks or the screen times out, the music stops. It's extremely frustrating, especially considering one of the key features of the app is to keep music playing during phone use/rest."
"The app is crashing every time I try to click the 3dot button for options. I tried restarting the phone and reinstalling the app but the problem persists. Yes, I'm using the latest version. There is a similar thread on the forum but it is still unsolved for over 2 months. Please fix this bug!!!"
"I love Spotify as a service but it's hard to tell something good about its player. The app has unintuitive, inconsistent and sometimes bizarre interface. Options that should be available in an instant are hidden many taps away and it's just discouraging to use."
So they moved the HEART button and I've been accidentally deleting songs like crazy from my songs list. And its without the song open so like I cant even find half of them anymore. THANKS FOR THE HORRIBLE UPDATE.
It used to be good with no issues but for some reason it just stops playing the song mid way and I have to press the play button again for the song to start but it starts over. It does it too frequently to actually enjoy the music.
"Unresponsive UI, everything load very slowly even the downloaded content. Album tab takes forever to load, accessing single album or playlist is ridiculously slow. For now, I have to switch to the lite version. Despite the lack of features, it loads everything much much quicker."
"Inappropriate suggestions. I listen to mostly opera and classical music. I do not want inapproriately titled podcasts showing up in my feed. I have no interest in them, and quite frankly, it is embarrassing when anyone else sees them. I am almost ready to dump the service because of it."
"The app has a beautiful UI and amazing engine to create Playlist according to my listening habit, but all of that cannot compensate for the lack of music in the present library. I would have easily subscribed to the service if these shortcomings were not present."
"A clicking and static sound comes through more often than not when connected to an AUX cable from my phone. I have no other issues with spotify but this is a dealbreaker. Ive cleared the cache and data... uninstalled and re-installed, and the problem persists."
great app. love that it syncs with Shazam. just recently started exploring podcasts too & im addicted. ***Edit*** newest update has made the *SORT* button on podcast episodes stop working completely! I can't even click on it.
Why on earth is it no longer possible to add an entire album to a playlist. The app seems to be getting worse (as far as UX is concerned) with every update. Keep this up and I might start looking into alternatives at some point.
"The app has crashed/frozen/stopped a TON lately. Even when streaming music I have downloaded. The new layout is way less intuitive too. Roll back some of the ""improvements"" and just boost stability, please. My subscription is starting to become less worth it."
"Irritating design, Is it that hard to mimic the PC varient of Spotify? I don't see how you ended up making the mobile version more difficult and irritating to use. If I attempt to play a song from a selected playlist I have created, I can only view said songs from an ""edit playlist"" button. in which if I try to play a song it will play a 5 second bit of it- not the song I wanted to play. I currently can not play my music- through my playlists on Spotify, by mobile. Any help?"
(NO HATE) BUT This app was amazing at the start then i used the song hold on for my alarm and everything was perfect then for some reason spotify started adding their own song and ruining my playlist and alarm so can you please fix this its an amazing app but its giving me alot of problems
"Shuffle play sux on mobile, prices are too high, and I wouldnt mind playing the ad if the ad actually started playing. The delay is horribly long. If thats an ad strategy its horrible n cruel. Going back to amazin and google n youtube."
"offline mode is terrible. Most times i use the app whilst I'm offline (e.g.: on the Tube) Spotify doesn't let me see, select, or listen to any of my downloaded music (I'm a premium subscriber). I've tried reinstalling the app a few times. It even stays stuck in offline mode when i then have 4G, until i quit and reopen the app. Really frustrating! Now it has started to crash and hang halfway through a song, at random, even when the music is Downloaded and I have signal."
"Quite common for Spotify to pause shortly after screen has been turned off. Have experienced this only on Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S10, Android 9. Only after multiple force close and restart cycles starts to work as expected."
There have been a lot of unnecessary changes lately that make the app lose useful functionality. Radio is harder to find now and you also no longer click an album cover image to enlarge it. The new UI was confusing when implemented with very little benefit in usability.
"So I have the premium version and I've always loved spotify!! And quite frankly I couldn't see myself living without it (so to speak) until just a few weeks go.. regardless of what song I play, after about 20 seconds or so the song stops on it's own until I press a button to display my screen. Its extremely frustrating because at this point it makes the entire app NOT functional! Reading through the reviews I can clearly see that I am not the first to experience this. What can be done?!"
"This would have earned a five star before the update, but it was absolutely disappointing to see that the developers have restricted even more functions to premium only. For instance, now you can only listen to your songs on shuffle, which is immensely irritating for me. Spotify used to be the only decent free music app left, but the update ruined all that. This used to be a great app, it is very sad to see it turn in to a money hungry app just like the rest."
"Can't find some of the songs which turned out to be my favs. It's very frustrating.. 😖 Would've given a single star but this app impressed me how intelligently it recommends, and also that dark and clean UI made me rate high."
"A new change has kind of ruined spotify IMO. It may be a phone only issue? Spotify adds suggested songs to my playlists. I can no longer just click on a song I find and play it. I can choose to not play a song that I have added, but that option is not available for songs that Spotify added. I can choose to hide songs that Spotify added, but they still play! There is no option to delete the songs they added. The only reason I got this was to play my own playlists with my phone screen off."
"App frequently stops until I unlock my phone and tap on ""Play"". Quite annoying and dangerous especially while driving. This issue has become a lot more frequent since the most recent updates. Please fix before you loose more customers, me included."
I'm hating the new scroll bar. It's too close to the options button on each track so when I try to go it to say add that track to a playlist it just scroll me to a different point in the list. Serious idiot whoever's designed that.
"after the ""car mode"" update (not sure what else to call it), many of the basic features of the app aren't working, and the app crashes in the background quite often, maybe once every 20 minutes or so. in the lock screen, the previous-pause/play-next buttons don't seem to do anything anymore. the app was much better before the update."
It's my go to app for music I even have the family plan. But recently my music has been stopping out of nowhere so I gotta hit my sleep button waking up my phone then itll start playing again but not for long. I'm on a Samsung Galaxy S8 & I'm on the most recent firmware so idk.🤷🏼‍♂️ It wasn't always like this & I almost never mess with my settings in my phone so it can't be that. Until it stops being annoying I'm leaving this 2 star rating because it's acting like a 2 star app.
"I've never come across a worse app from such a big company. Casting to a device is a constant exercise in frustration, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Is there a reason for this? No. One bug saw me have to follow advice in a forum to log out of my family account on my device and use my partners log in. Then reverse the whole process to allow me to cast again. These problems have been on the forums for years too, ignored. This app has turned nice evenings into rage quitting fury."
"Works fine, but they keep moving, changing or removing features which makes for a very poor user experience. Now they removed the ability to add an entire album to a playlist. I have just started a month of free deezer to see if they do care about their users, so that i can cancel my spotify subscription."
"The app used to be great but I can't say the same about current version. Removed equaliser, removed quick queue add and many others, I feel like it has become way worse."
Recently the app stops playing music once my phone screen goes to sleep. I have to press the home button and unlock the screen in order for the music to resume. Not sure if it has anything to do with the particular phone device ( Galaxy S10).
"Incredible app for discovering new music, built on the backs of musicians that get paid in fractions of a cent. Needs to pay musicians way better, or else we won't have good music to stream anymore."
"On downloaded songs they cut and pause frequently, only starting again when I press a button on my phone. It's been since the new update, fix it please."
was good until you all changed the search artist and play radio based on that artist. I keep get your premade playlist with artists I cant stand. And removing the add entire album to a playlist is stupid. Stop making these unnecessary changes over and over again. You add then remove remove the same features. Its quite annoying.
"Still enjoy the service but the last couple of updates have been rubbish. Every time i pick a song in the new liked songs category it would switch off shuffle(this has been fixed now). Very frustrating when unable to change song while driving etc. And for some stupid reason you can't find all songs for an artist and have to individually click through albums o. Pretty unhappy with how the app is developing, UI has been consistently rubbish for several updates. Stop fixing what isnt broken!"
Current bug. Every 5 mins or less the music will stop. You have to unlock the phone or press the home button to get it to work again. Many reviews say this. I have contacted the developer using contacts given here. Please fix it because I love Spotify and I need my music
"I like Spotify and the app works well but WHY DO YOU KEEP REMOVING THE EASY FIND OPTION WITHIN PLAYLISTS? Always keeps being removed or added in updates. Just keep it the way it is. The less clicks one has to do, the better the user experience. Fyi. I mean there are actual important things in the world but one has to preoccupy themselves while on the toilet 🤔"
Has been a great app for over 2 yrs and now within the last few months the music will stop playing If your screen goes to sleep. This needs to be fixed as it's quite frustrating having to stop what you're doing just to open your phone and press play again
"Currently experiencing issues where music will stop playing by aux cord when the phone is locked and when you unlock it, it immediately starts playing. Also when it connects to my Bluetooth speaker, i cant use the media panel widget on the lock screen of my phone to control the music. Ive tried uninstalling the app and the same issue still occurred! FIX PLEASE!"
"Feels like the UI makes you go through loops to just download the song you want to create an ""all songs"" playlist. I have to like the song or album, then go find it later to download. Unless I'm missing something but Apple Music seems more user friendly."
The latest ui overhaul was not thought out and is very frustrating. When I save a song it doesn't show up under my albums unless i save the whole album. There's no longer a songs tab at the top of the screen all your saved songs go into a playlist now which is way less convenient. I dont understand why spotify is romoving features and changing the way the app works.
It will not let me add songs to my playlist unless they have an album. Whenever i press the plus button it doesnt add to my playlist so i only have a couple of the songs i want.
"Wasn't going to rate this app, but then it crashed while trying to close the ""rate us!"" pop-up, which was too ironic to not come and rate it. It works fine on a phone but stinks for Chromebooks, and the web app doesn't work properly either. Please make an app that is designed for the Chromebook, or fix the issues with the web app."
"Recently switched from iphone to android, and found apple music doesn't work quite as well. So I thought I would try spotify's 3 month trial I really like the overall layout of the platform, the behind the lyrics, the mini vids that play during certain songs, and once spotify figured out my music tastes it started making great playlists for me. This is all great, but the app continually pauses for lengthy periods multiple times during songs, even if they are downloaded. Which is insane!"
"Really bad experience. Please consider this review. I've opted for the 3months free premium, yet I can't save my downloads. Everytime I play from the downloads, the app requires access to Internet. So many songs aren't there at all. My favourite artist, Charlie Puth, there isn't a song there and that is really frustrating. Please give it up in an update. Hoping a reply.."
"Used to love Spotify. But now I can't listen to songs that I like. I made a playlist of my favourite artists and it kept on SHUFFLING it with other songs. Ads keep popping out, and when I don't like the songs I skip. Then you tell me that 6 skips per hour only? And I had to get to premium? I'm sure that people won't want to enjoy their music by paying it. The shuffle grey button thing doesn't appear in my app and I hate it. At least give us some freedom to choose songs that we like."
"I was loving it AT FIRST. Then, it did this thing where I will play a song, it will give me like 5 seconds of a random part of a song, then it randomly plays a random song. Just use YouTube, its better now they did this update that ruined everything good on this app."
"Funny how a Spotify has been in development for a decade and the performance has only gotten worse with every update. The redeeming social features are progressively being phased out, and the UI has become nothing short of a maze. Please start listening to your userbase."
"What the hell. I cant play my music unless my screen is on. I have checked my phone settings and there is no restrictions on the app, have deleted my cache and the and reinstalled the app but to no success and even with updates to the app has not changed anything. I pay for this kind of service?! Well Google play music I am coming. Might be some work to rebuild playlist but no worries."
"Love spotify, however lately I've had issues with playback when my phone goes to sleep. The music cuts in and out, and I have to press either a volume button or turn on the screen before it plays again. Will delete this review if the issue is fixed"
"No longer able to easily search for songs in ""liked song"" impossible to find a specific artist in your library without typing it in. Not very intuitive anymore. Please fix"
Enjoy the music and podcasts but it keeps crashing and being laggy. I'm frustrated as I'm paying for premium and this shouldn't happen. Also why does the artwork on the home screen keep getting bigger and why are there less buttons at the bottom. It makes it more difficult to get to what I want to do. Additionally can you actually day what you've updated in the change log I'd be nice to know what's happening
What happened to the widget for Android?!?! It's irritating that i no longer have the widget for quick play and song skipping. I hate having to open the entire app every time i use Spotify
"Was really great, until it stopped showing me the playlist and only let me listened to shuffled playlists. I can't exactly listen to TAZ out of order. It ruins the continuity."
"Last update changed the UI and its much worse. I want to browse songs old way. Even sorting by Artists doest work, only by Recently added. ""To make sure you don’t miss a thing, just keep your Updates turned on."" - I would like to see these changes 😉. There are no Whats new details."
"Everything has changed and i dont like it. This app has always been my go to, piss easy to use, plenty of variety, all my ""saved"" songs were in the same place. Now, playing Spotify makes my phone restart, nothing is where it should be...Where is my ""library"" button Spotify, where is it? Oh wait its now ""liked songs"" but to get to that i had to re-download all my albums because it got rid of the library feature. Its also now playing songs that i haven't ""liked"". Ive gone from love to disappointed"
"Songs will stop mid way through, and go back to the beginning of that song but will not resume until you go into app and hit play button twice. Am i the only one with this issue?"
"It was a decent service until the recent overhaul: the removal of the dislike button and the fact that the ""radio"" stations are no longer infinite is really making me look for another option."
On previous versions of Spotify it was possible to delete specific tracks from downloaded albums. This is no longer possible and particularly annoying when Spotify only provides deluxe editions of albums with multiple versions of the same song. This means downloading albums with 40 plus songs on them when you only want the original 12. Fix please
Whenever i set an equalizer it is good until i open other app and keep Spotify in the background. The equializer then resets to default and i have to change it again. Really irritating
"Disappointing. The recent update now means that sometimes the music cuts off if my phone is asleep. I then have to wake it up before the music starts. Also sometimes the song will pause, but the app has to be restarted before I can keep playing. Very poor user experience."
This app was great until the recent update :( whenever I go out of spotify or hit the home button it just goes off and can't play anymore..please developers fix this cuz music is my life and this app is the music..pls fix
One of the few apps i pay for - probably over 5 years now. Crashes ALOT recently. Also the UI is pretty poor if you just want to access and organise your playlists rather than have poorly algorithmed recommendations shoved in front of you. Starting to explore alternatives...
Splendid app until recently. Now seems to run quite slowly and discontinuing the widget was a big disappointment. The lock screen controls don't always work and having to wait on the app to load just to skip or find something else is a drag.
"Was a fantastic app until they removed the widget, its genuinely a noticeable loss and doesnt seem to be coming back. The worst part is that it seems to have been removed for no reason"
"The Spotify widget is now gone and I cant 'quick play' my music off my home screen anymore. What happened? That widget was the best part of the app... If I get into a car accident, I'm changing my review to 1-star."
Used to love it but now that the widget is gone im about done with it if u bring it back put a add (+) button so you can add songs to your playlist from the widget with open the whole app if u do that I'll give ya !! * * * * * !!
Can't stand the ui nowadays. I prefered having all ky downloaded songs in one massive playlist. Now most have disappeared and i hsve to like individual songs. The filters are rubbish too
loved it till the new update made it so my music shuffle plays even if I dont hit shuffle play. why have that button on liked songs if that's my only option anyway? probably canceling my premium at the end of the month now and going to find another app that I can listen to my songs in the order I like
"Spotify is a great music streaming platform. However, the app currently does not allow you to block or prevent someone from following you. This is deeply problematic since anyone can follow you and see your activity and there's nothing you can do about it. I have no problem with the social infrastructure they've created but at least give people the ability to block or not allow anyone to follow you. This is a very poor design currently."
"Good for playing shuffle music you have no control if you're not using premium. When the ad banner shows up, it becomes a battle to dismiss it, the dismiss button do not work."
Removing a core useability feature like the widget is completely baffling. Thankfully SoundCloud hasn't followed suit. Was basically 5/5... no longer.
Ever since the newest update the pause feature has stopped working. It basically just acts as a mute button and continues playing whatever in the backround so i have to search to try and find my spot in podcasts now
"The new layout sucks. The older version was far easier to use. The UI ""improvements"" ruin the app. 1) Increase the song limit. 2) Why kill the toggle/click the letter function? That's stupid. 3) Get rid of the bloated deluxe albums, and add the regular versions as well. I don't want to save an album and get 50+ tracks I won't listen to. 4) I hate that the Artists tab is now just artists I've ""followed"" rather than artists I have saved albums of. 5) The UI itself is terrible and shuffle is default"
Love the music collection available. With the latest updates music streaming is quite slow and it's hard to listen to a complete song without interruptions. Also the widget was recently taken out and was one of the most useful things for easy control of the app and the music.
"Needs option to toggle color of UI. Although the app itself works rather well, I've always had trouble reading the font (even though I'm a young adult) due to problems with my cornea. White font on a dark background does hell for me as I see multiple ghosts , and gives me a headache. A lot of people would benefit from this feature, and as a paying member it's the main reason I'm considering changing my music provider. Would love if the devs could finally listen and add this!"
"These recent updates have absolutely ruined the app and ease of use. Everything takes an extra 3 steps now, especially not having albums saved to my liked songs. Gonna give it a month or two before cancelling. Why fix what's not broken?"
"It's a great app usually, but recently it's starting quitting randomly every hour or so, often more, for no discernible reason at all. Also, all the widgets have disappeared. And if I'm briefly in an area with no phone signal it'll often refuse to let me access songs and playlists that are synced to my device."
"The fact that you have access to so much music is great, otherwise the app is poor. The interface could be more intuitive, the removal of the homescreen widget is frustrating, the inability to automatically download subscribed podcasts is just plain stupid (when every podcast app does this AND this app automatically downloads songs from subscribed playlists anyway) and it's easily the most laggy app I use."
"The UI really lets the service down. If you're internet connection is just a tiny bit not perfect uou can't navigate the menus to find music, even the music that you've downloaded for offline play. also removing the home screen widget is a bad move"
"Has given me no problems for the last few years but since the recent update it hasn't quite been the same. The home widget is no longer available and when the phone locks spotify now cuts out, meaning the phone always has to be open and unlocked to play 😥. Dissapointing that this has occurred after years of no problems."
"New interface is terrible. The most illogical, user-unfriendly, downgrade possible. Absolutely ruins the experience.. please just revert it and make it sensible again."
"NOT COOL, SPOTIFY!! THE WIDGET WAS NOT REDUNDANT! I WANT THE WIDGET BACK! Two stars forever unless you bring back the widget. Did you even ask your users' opinion before deciding to remove it? Not cool. And the app is STILL stopping songs randomly so I have to start them over again from the beginning - not even the point where the app stopped. What is going ON, Spotify!? I used to sing your praises but that is quickly changing!"
This app used to be great! BUT.... and that's a big but. The last update seems to have removed some features that myself and other users on an android system were quite fond of. The main feature removed and probably the only useful one was the ability to have a Widget on your home screen making for a very convenient music player. Why break what wasn't broken? Who wants to pay for an app that is now arguably worse than Apple music 🤷‍♂️ Maybe sort it out yeah?
The recent updates have started to ruin it.... the new layout took away from the ease of use and certain features I really liked. The removal of the widget in the most recent update is really aggravating.
"Great service in principle - however last couple of app updates are very frustrating, negatively affecting user experience. The introduction of a random (and changing) order of playlists when adding songs makes creating multiple playlists on this app very difficult, plus removal of the widget. Been a premium user for years, but this has got me looking at other options."
i have been loving this app but recently it seems to have gotten significantly worse. they removed the widget which made skipping tracks a little quicker. also whenever my lock screne comes up the volume randomly cuts In and out when using my phone speakers. typically just touching or moving my phone gets the volume to work again but it's a great way to interrupt your favorite song. also I'm using a galaxy s10 so I would really like to think it's not my phone acting up already.
I loved it until they got rid of the lyrics. I was fine with it but then also got rid of the widget for no reason. Why? No explanation of why? No reason to get rid of it. When I'm driving the widget is a god send. Thanks for making me use less of your service because now you've made my driving and using spotify more dangerous cause of all the buttons i have to press to change a song.
"I use the spotify widget very often, but now I can no longer find it, quite a hassle to find it and select previous or next song."
"Please bring back the Android Widget!! I literally used it daily and my user experience has become so much more inconvenient now it's gone! As a premium user I'm on the whole pretty pleased, but this really really makes the entire app itself so much more bothersome, there's no quick ways to pause or skip songs anymore I have to open the complete app to do such a small, quick, action, and it's not like I'm asking for a completely new feature; this was possible a few days ago!"
"App keeps shutting off when phone goes to sleep, even though there are no restrictions on the app (battery usage) and it is not on the app sleep list. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and the problem still persists. The issue occurs with both Bluetooth and Auxiliary options, and while utilizing other apps."
"Was great until the widget was removed, my primary method of interaction with the app. Good UI means giving customers the best possible experience, something you have now removed for many."
"They literally took away the widget for no reason, and every update is making the app worse. Its getting a bit ridiculous... p.s. Use the ubiquity music widget app to replace this stripped feature 👍 it's better than nothing. Hope this helps others."
"Since the last few updates, a once great app rapidly goes down the drain.  The revamped UI is a catastrophe, it constantly tries to shove it's recommendations down your throat.  NO. STOP IT. I WANT to decide what I'm listening to.   Also the removal of the widget is a kick in any subscriber's nuts. I'm using Spotify as a quick and CONVENIENT way to listen to music on android. Hell, I pay extra to my carrier to have unlimited data for Spotify. And convenience just got rooted out from the experience, because ""we decided to drop the widget?"" Without consulting with the users? Google, Sygic, and all the other devs seem to be able to ASK before they remove something so crucial.   Keep this up, and you will loose me as a subscriber."
"I've been a premium user for years now but last night my widget disappeared after an update. Why would you remove it? I used the widget almost exclusively to control the app. Some terrible design changes lately, very irritating. Seriously considering canceling my subscription and moving over to something else now"
"Generally Spotify is alright but really only because that's what everyone uses so it has the most on it. Latest updates have been ruining it though, performance issues, connectivity issues (namely with my car), UI issues, especially annoying is the removal of the widget. Now there's just a big hole in my homescreen."
What is going on with this app lately!? It's running slower now than any of its competitors and has become incredibly buggy - the filter and search-cancel buttons for playlists/artists/albums have simply stopped working! Are all the real developers on summer vacation???
"There is bug in displaying advertisement. It has watch now and dismiss button but i can't click on any of it. Moreover, when i tap on it , it clicks on whatever song is there in background of that advertisement. Guys, please fix this. I have to force close and open again in order to listen next songs. Hope you take this bug seriously."
"This app UI is very un-intuitive, and just got worse! Spotify as a service is great, but their apps are a huge let down. They seriously need to start listening to the user community and fix the huge user experience problems."
"Great app, great UI, the only thing I am not satisfied is the content available for India. The songs are limited, many new and trending albums such as Ed Sheeran's No.6 aren't available for India. The competitors like Apple music, Amazon Music and even Gaana have more albums and songs to offer. I love Spotify's connect features which can be used even connecting to PS4 which I always do, but paying ₹1000/year seems not worth it. I would really like spotify to add most of if not all of albums."
I've had this app for years and I've always loved it but for a couple of months now it constantly stops playing and I have to close it out and restart. Wth?! its ruining my experience.
They recently changed the interface to something much worse and it's horrible. Show us the artist that we've saved songs from!! Not recommended artists! Why change a design that works to something obviously much worse???
I like the app and ui but the lag on this is mad... I have a Samsung s8 which works quickly enough with other apps. If I run it into a car it can become mayhem. You skip a song and it could be 30 seconds before something happens. Hard to understand. And same with downloaded playlist.
The app was usually good but the past month or so buttons won't work if i have my blue light filter on so i have to go into the settings every time and turn it off to get things to play.
The streaming service is alright but could use a bigger database of songs. Not enough variety in some genres and feels like mass repetition in the older eras of music. Also not impressed with the inability to transfer my existing premium family account to my email rather than through my Facebook. I would like to delete my Facebook but that would mean deactivating my current Spotify account and purchasing again the premium family and reconnecting all my members to it. Quite the hassle.
I don't want to listen to songs that are not on my playlist but if you don't have premium you can't choose that which is completely stupid. It used to be that you could hit the repeat button and it wouldn't go off of your playlist. If I want to listen to a playlist with certain songs I shouldn't have to listen to songs that are not on my playlist no matter if I have premium or not.
"considering how well known spotify is supposed to be, it has a pathetic UI with a good number of glitches. It doesnt even have a simple shuffle button."
"Loved this app and have been a subscriber for years but the newest update ruined the app. I want the option to play just my songs. I lose service frequently where I live and that's why I downloaded the songs I liked, and now even when playing my songs it throws in others that i didn't download and stops my music telling me no internet connection."
used to be perfect but now they have taken away functions like being able to see all your downloaded song and scroll through them easily. app has changed to be focussed on playlists rather than individual user experience and customisation. love spotify and streaming music but miss the old app functionality and am forced to use the desktop version whenever possible to find the music I actually want to listen to.
"it would play the same 10 songs in different orders over and over in my playlist with over 500 songs. I half expected to listen to my entire playlist, but I guess you don't always get that luxury"
"I've a premium account but still Spotify's own ad pops up now and then asking to peddle discounts. Music authenticity check is weak and the app does not truly runs in the background; if you close all apps at once, it gets closed as well so need to close apps one by one to make it run. Music suggestions are not intuitive."
"I've been using Spotify for over a year now, and it's been a downhill ride. Updates keep changing the UI, adding useless features and removing another. For example, the settings button is only availabe on Home tab now. Most annoying for ny experience is that we cannot filter songs inside a playlist anymore, which is a pain in the ass for my growing playlist."
"New UI is terrible, the whole home page isn't working for me. Sideways navigation makes it very slow, half the time it doesn't respond to my swipes. I miss the overview of the lists, or a 'more' option per section, now I only see half of the albums I recently played. Please fix it, I've been using Spotify for years and it's my main source of new music but you're making it super difficult like this. Cheers"
"Big music libary but unfortunately the app is terribly designed, works slow and connecting to other devices via wifi glitches way too often. Other points: - managment of downloaded songs/albums is unintuitive (liked songs vs albums vs playlists) - both creating playlists and magaging queued songs on android app is a lot of work (you cannot select or drag) - play button lags even while playing offline songs - finding saved playlists takes too long because you cannot sort or mark them"
"I HATE the new update, over the past 10 years of having spotify I have been slowly building a huge library of saved songs and now they are all gone.......there's no way on earth I'll remember them all. So mad"
"Quite good, not so, just like it makes a hype in everyone now a days. I couldn't find too many songs of Sonu Nigam and some other popular artists. But sound quality and app interface is nice. I hope the cons are fullfilled by the next updates."
"Recent updates have made it brutal to navigate. Frequently used menus, like songs I've downloaded, are impossible to find. Spotify, hire some real UX designers!"
"Did an update today now i have no widget its just gone an cant replace it with a new widget. Keeps saying error 😠😠😠not happy at all £9.99 a month an its not working, how do you cancel your contract again 🤔🤣😂Seriously though i would like this sorted an quick life without music is not good at all"
"Sometimes an ad flashes and remains static on the display. I have to close the app and reopen it to eliminate the static ad display. The 'dismiss' button stops working. Also, there a lot of unavailable songs like a lot of Cardi B's songs. Please resolve this issue."
"If I have to struggle against the UI, the UI sucks. The mobile app gets worse with every update. ""No Internet Access."" Album libraries not displaying. UI changes implemented with the hamfistedness of a corporation that doesn't realize that they're the delivery service, not the artist. All I want is my content, not the ""Next Big Thing."" Quit ""sleekifying,"" baby-proofing, and de-optimizing and give me customization features. More Apple than Apple, I swear. 2/5"
"It used to be good. The latest version just ruined the whole experience. Takes forever to load, even the songs that were supposed to be available offline"
biases towards specific artists (drake being the worst) when exploring the homepage is a very bad way to run a payed-for music app. there is also a bug that has existed in the app for years where the app size starts at a few mbs and inflates to over a gigabyte ovr a very short period of time requiring multiple reinstalls just to see the file size blow up again. please fix or I will move to soundcloud.
"Great selection but missing features that would improve upon the reccomendation system, feels like you need to actively avoid listening to some artists for fear of ruining your discovery playlists."
"This was a great app but the newest update has broken it for me. The UI is harder use, it always crashes, stops podcasts midway and goes back to the start, annoying delays when navigating menus. Now it says that I don't have premium on mobile, but online and desktop it says I do and works fine there. Hopefully this app gets a better update soon."
"Used to be a pretty stellar app but now inconsistently runs at a increasingly sluggish rate with embarrassing loading times (up to a minute to load a playlist, album, artist page, etc). Not to mention unresponsive UI and frequent crashes in and outside of the app. Music has a habit of continuing to play even after closing the app but abruptly stopping when in another app. Please optimise this app, it is becoming more of a chore to use than anything else."
"I would have suggested spotify as an overall experience to anyone several weeks ago, but with the new update i would tell them to go with literally any other streaming platform. Its such a huge step in the wrong direction and makes for a very counterintuitive and irritating experience. Sad to say that if things aren't changed I'll be switching. Sorry for being such a grump but it SUCKS"
there new UI is atrocious and load times are completely unacceptable. I'm looking for alternative services after being a premium subscriber for several years.
"Whose idea of a good UX is this latest update? Alphabetical sorting disappeared under a menu and doesn't even work for artist, song list gone, slow UI. Linux desktop app still fine, but Android a complete mess. 2 stars on account of the Android app, if functionality was the same as it was a few weeks back it'd be 4 or 5"
its a great music player but everytime i open another app with spotify open the music stops and i have to go to notifications and press play befor i can do something else. please just let me listen to my music. ive tried going onto there support page and trouble shooting and all of that stuf but it still doesnt work. would rat it higher but that one problem ruins it completely for me.
"it was ok the way it was, sans a few functionality issues and UI discrepancies. With the new update, all of your saved artists are scrambled and in no order. Also the home screen buttons dont work maybe 50% of the time. It wasn't broke before but you ""fixed"" it anyways."
It's a great app for streaming music and finding new music but the recent update just completely ruined the functionality of it. They've made it a lot harder to save new songs and there are so many problems with syncing the desktop and mobile app.
"Huawei P10 Everything still works - BUT - after last update: 1. I lost shoutcut ""Spotify offline"" in slide bar 2. ""Your library"" design is now way less practical - I liked the history of played songs below folders & in folder ""albums"" the albums are no longer separated (alphabetically) but blended together. It's less transparent to use. << 5stars for previous version >>"
Meh. Song selection is great but otherwise it is no better than other music apps. I also don't fancy spending 15 quid to listen offline when other apps allow downloading free. I wanted a specific song that my other app didn't have. I'd rather just go without. Uninstalled as I'm unimpressed
The app has become really slow since the redesign! Honestly speaking I didn't hate the new layout but its become soo slow to open albums its frustrating. Please fix it guys spotify used to be awesome
"New update UX is pure dreadful & a mess. Managing downloaded songs is painstakingly complicated - some removed downloaded songs are still in the liked songs, and user need to 'like' a song to download, and good luck bulk with removing songs. Finding artist is now like finding needle in a haystack since some songs from artist A didn't exist in the Library, hence you need to type it out instead of scrolling, and the 'follow' list is just pure annoyance. Great job."
"Ever since the last update, my playlist keeps pausing. I have to continually hit the play button to listen to songs. The app was my go to for listening to music, but now listening is just a hassle. Super frustrating."
"Always liked Spotify until the latest UI change. Now I can't search by song, cant access daily mix as easily, and lots of my saved songs have been ""unsaved"" or ""unliked"". I used to rely on Spotify for my 5 YEAR LONG library, but I've lost so many songs, now I'm looking at other ways of keeping record. Not happy at all"
"updated recently and now the app pauses on its own and takes forever to load. doesnt matter if im connected to bluetooth, aux chord in the car, or even wired headphones"
"before this latest update I absolutely loved Spotify. I used it as my everyday music listening service. This new update and totally ruined the easy way they had for browsing artists that you had saved in your library. Instead of alphabetical order they now have it set as ""recommended artists based on what you listen to"" please change it back"
"The whole app is designed to make you listen to music in a certain way, instead of giving the users the tools to listen to music in the way they like. So if your preferences are different to what Spotify wants you to do, you're in a bad spot."
"Ive had spotify premium for at least a year now, and id gladly give it five stars if it werent for the latest update. its annyoing to actaully use the app. Why make it more complicated? Why hide the search button on your own liked songs? its more frustating to use , please revert back to the old verison."
"I listen to podcasts while I'm driving, now that youve removed the back/forward 15 seconds buttons from Android Auto, I am seriously considering changing to a better app. Can we have these buttons back please??"
The app itself is great. But it's a shame you need to pay for basic controls like skip or replay song/playlist. I also hate that it plays songs other than those from my playlist. And of course I can't replay nor skip the songs because.... 'premium' required. I'm dissapointed. I didn't expect that I have to pay 10£ in order to skip or replay a song- it's STUPID! For a song lover like me is like putting a price tag on the air I breathe.
I have problem this few days with d apps .. Song kept on playing half way .. And it will get stuck .. Or pause by itself .. By pressing play button back .. Then song automatically start again from d beginning .. And will get stuck again while playing half way ..
"I loving spotify. But after an update it changes the library part of Spotify to be like a free user library, whilst I'm using premium. I'm having a hard time to search my songs in the library. Also, albums that I saved doesn't link with my liked songs. Why would I saved the albums if I don't like the album? Basically I'm having free user experience, with premium payment, and it's ruining my experience. Pls give a feedback about this. Thank you."
"Why change a UI that was already working? I have a subscribed service to Google music, and thought I'd check out Spotify. This is my 3rd month. I'll be deleting and moving on. 2/5 stars."
"The newest interface is garbage. No one wants to sort their music by most recent download. Also, stop trying to bury the abililty to shuffle all downloaded music in non-intuitive ways. If you're going to monopolize media players make it user friendly."
"This app was perfect until the new UI update. Now all of the songs that you save after the update won't even showed up in your liked songs, and the albums are randomly shuffled for some weird reason. If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
"clunky to use. I'm not a fan of Pandora at all!, but Pandora does have way better interface to quickly get to music especially while I'm on the road."
"I feel so sad for this version. The autoplay doesn't work. I have to tap play/next button to continue the playlist. It's just annoying, I am on my premium account but the problem stay the same :("
Ruined a great app by trying to think for us. Alphabetical so much better to find artist. Now it's useless unless I'm totally parked. Much better before. I don't need recommended artists from my library. My tastes vary too my mood. Don't have time to search for 20 minutes when before it was seconds
"The UI is awful. The 'Liked' section is horrendous as there are songs in there that I never even heard of, yet somehow I like it? Plus you have to Unlike individually, which is painstakingly stupid. Also the songs keep stopping while listening, when I'm even holding the phone."
newest update made the app slow af. opening an album I have downloaded takes >10 seconds and the app freezes when switching back from another app making it impossible to quickly change songs
"The service is fantastic, execution nonsensical. A few days ago (date posted 26.6.19), Spotify's layout changed and damaged user experience. The problems are: 1. What happened to Recently Played? It was removed entirely, and music is in three tabs now: Playlists, Artists, and Albums. 2. The sorting in these tabs is absurd. Playlists places last listened to on top. Artists is only alphabetical for followed artists, regardless of download status. Album works fine. 3. Load times increased."
"The new UI update sucks absolute ass, all the ease and ingegration of the previous set up is completely gone. No more ease of access, no more going through all the artists whose songs you have saved. Can i roll back to the much better, more user friendy interface please? This is frustrating."
"Since the latest update I hate the new library. Why can't I have all my songs in one spot, like before? Why do I have to follow an artist? It also seems to go through a lot of data even though I am super careful to only play downloaded music when I'm not on wifi. I love the recommendations and radios, but the UI has always been pretty atrocious and this update made it so much worse."
"Was a good service, but company doesn't care for the app and it is deeply flawed Repeated and frequent unnecessary redesigns. Slow response to attempts to get artist information. confusion when trying to work without a constant internet connection. Try another music service. I will."
"weirdly enough, despite this probably being the number one music-streaming app out there, i find that new music is released way more quickly on indian apps like Saavn. also, many songs from my favourites list seem to have vanished, but i can now only see them in the search list. i honestly cant figure out the problem, but i hope the app gets better soon"
"terrible update. removal of features, slow and unstable, poor UI, lack of filtering options. first time I've questioned about paying monthly."
"the app is constantly gliching, the basic features like opening/closing the app and changing songs from the tool bar. my experience with spotify with an iphone was fine but i feel like on an samsung phone, the app isn't as well suited. I expect better from spotify as i have been using this for almost 3 years now."
The app stops playing music after every song. I have to unlock my phone and either open the app and hope the pause/play button will fix it or close the app altogether. It never was like this
"You have work because users across the country loved your app and it's offerings. The app's latest update is terrible, and the functionality of it has taken a dive for the worse. The new UI is actually not good. The removal of the saved Artists/Songs/Albums amd the organization of a users downloaded content is laughable. I don't know about how serious people really are, but i can say with certainty that I will take my money and my subscription service elsewhere if these things aren't addressed."
"i only use the free version so doubt spotify care but like others, it started to drop out when screen went off. it also pretty quickly ends up playing b grade junk. I tried Amazon music again and it's been flawless and is doing a much better job and playing songs I want to hear."
horrible update... im not one to leave many reviews but this new update to UI and navigation has made this very frustrating to use. music should be simple and whoever decided this update was ok took the simplicity of finding music and liked songs/artists out. like no alphabetical filters in their predefined categories blows my mind. please revert or address in future updates
"It's a good app for music. I've been a premium user for years. I don't like the new design, I enjoyed the previous version where I had quick access to all of my songs and albums by artist. This new update should just be forgotten about"
"New library layout is appallingly unintuitive. Old one was so much more usable. Give us back alphabetical artists, and not just within the album tab. Not everyone likes the focus on playlists, the old interface was accessible to all users. Change for the sake of change has led to a worse UX."
this most recent change to the user interface is about to make me try another music service. I have been a spotify premium subscriber for about 5 years now and if it doesn't change soon I'll be discontinuing my subscription
Last update is annoying. The shuffle button won't stay put; everytime I restart the app I have to press shuffle again. While searching for specific songs it will eventually freeze.
"Spotify India sucks!!! Most of my music gallery is gone, I don't know what ongoing lawsuit they're stuck in but the quality of my experience on this app has drastically decreased ever since I downloaded the Indian version. even my music recommendations are ruined the app either recommends songs that are already in my gallery or random bollywood music that I'm just not interested in. Definitely not worth the premium subscription I was better off using an apk version lol"
okay so I have had this app for a long time and it started to do some weird stuff. After every song it would quit playing weather it would be connected to my bluetooth or not. please fix
"The latest Spotify update for android is awful. I have to search for things I always listen to, plus an extra button just to get the search bar in liked songs. This new UI makes the user experience awful. Also every time I go to my liked songs it unshuffles them instead of saving the settings I had before."
"I really like Spotify in general, but the latest update (19/6/19) has killed it for me. The new playlist tab is unintuitive and only sorts itself according to recently played. I have taken time to arrange my playlists in a certain order and I feel the confusing new layout is a step back rather than forward. Please return it to how it was (choice of recently played and custom order) or at least give us the option of having a custom order for playlists"
"The latest update has really ruined the app. If you selectively save songs from an album, the same albums shows repeatedly under the artist - in my case as many as 5 times for the same album! Then when you actually select the album, it says there are no songs saved!"
"this new update it kinda sucks. everytime i click a song it takes it off shuffle, so i have to repeatedly set it as shuffle.now the scroll on it is weird, instead of being able to grab the bar on the side of the screen to quickly scroll down, i have to scroll down with my thumb for a bit until the bar will pick up my movement and not click something else. i also cant look at all my artists anymore, i am given 10 artists and if im looking for someone else i have to search for them."
"The new UI is absolutely bloody awful, complete garbage. Especially for podcast listeners. If it stays this way for long I'll drop my premium and switch to stitcher"
"new update makes the app freeze for a solid 10 seconds when you press on an album. it gets really annoying after a while. also, why remove 'add to queue' when long-pressing an album? there's a bunch of other options, why not just add it? new design is pretty clean and nice"
"The UI team has absolutely wrecked this application with the latest version, making my Song Library appear as a playlist and having Shuffle not be permanently on as a result. Please fix this."
"the new UI is not great. The icon and letters are way too big, can't see the recently played and it takes a lot of time to cycle through my followed artist. Had a good time with it before and it was the smooth and clean UI that made me chose Spotify over anything else, but right now I'll probably check another streaming service"
"used to be the best music app, but since the ui update its buggy, clunky and stops playing at random intervals. hoping it gets fixed sooner than later."
"Who the hell designed this latest app release? I go in to Your Library, click on Artists at the top expecting to see a list of artists that I have hearted all listed out in alfabetical order, yet they are now all scrambled together and 1,000 times harder to find the artist I want to listen to. Who makes and who approves these terrible UI decisions? Ridiculous!"
"Volume issues are ruining my Spotify experience. i moved from Apple Misic as it has poor playlist and suggested music functionality. Spotify is better for that. However, every song is coming out at different volumes neaning I am forever adjusting. Also, when streaming to wifi speakers, it takes about 3-4 seconds for any change to feed through. Annoying."
"The new ui is terrible, and now the app crashes more than internet explorer. They shot themselves in the foot here. Not worth the price of premium."
"This recent update has made it VERY slow to load my library. To load anything honestly on this app. I can barely click on an album with the app taking 20 seconds to load out of a black screen, & it was NOT like this before, it used to load quick & easy, under 2 seconds before, now its just a laggy & slow feeling with this new update. Please Fix??"
"Can spotify stop giving me songs I dont want to freakin hear? I created a playlist for me to listen to the songs i want, not for you to mess it up by forcing me to listen to whatever else ypu choose. At least give a way to turn it off or something And if a function like that is only in pReMiuM then Im not using this anymore. My day has been ruined enough times."
"Not quite there yet. Please update your library. Edit - Okay, I'm just another customer with a premium subscription. Here to tell you that you're kinda really pissing me off now. Every second artist / band I search for is missing from your library. I have to say, amazon prime music is much better (and way cheaper) in every way except maybe their UI."
"This new UI obliterated my organization. which was ALPHABETICAL. How can a designer possibly forgo the first organizational concept in language? I cant even alter it on the app. I really enjoyed spotify in spite of some things, but it literally takes me much longer now to locate any of my playlists. Thanks, really appreciate the consideration shown for people suffering from OCD."
this has been my go to music app for the past 7 years. it was great untill the new ui was introduced which makes it really hard to explore new music because you cant access recently played from music any more but the home page which is harder to scroll thru and no only usable online.
"I really enjoy spotify but, the new UI SUCKS! So hard. Please make it easier to make mobile playlists. Send us notifacations for new releases of followed artists, and don't even get me started on the artist section!"
Usability is farm more important than design. The new ui looks good but it makes everything harder to do. Why should I have to tap 2 buttons to search through my playlists.
"i've always liked spotify, but the new update moved the search engine in the saved songs library to a 3 dot button. inconvenient. i prefer the previous version"
"i love spotify but the new updates are ruining my experience entirely! im hoping that yall go back to how it used to be soon, otherwise i will be forced to switch music apps. please fix this, as i enjoy being a loyal spotify user"
"The newest update is pretty shite. It made your own library less intuitive.It didn't fix the issue where you select an artist/album and the songs won't show up (this actually got worse, it now sometimes won't show even on 2nd and 3rd tries). The load times for everything, including offline library have increased as well. Very poor update indeed."
"UI became pretty slow in the recent updates. Also it rarely connects successfully whenever I search for anything outside of my frequent rotation. After some inspection, I found that most of the time the app simply isn't sending out http requests for uncached data. Are the devs aware of this and are they gonna focus on fixing this at all in the next updates?"
"The new app is almost unusable. Nothing loads quick, the app crashes often, downloads don't show up in your downloaded library. Think i might switch to another service just because the app is horrible."
Why swap to random when im searching my saved albums/artists. If i wanted to listen to music randomly thats what the shuffle button is for. put Artists @ Albums back in alphabetical order instead of gobbledigook then you can have a 5☆ as I have been very happy with this app til now....... So ive sorted albums alphabetically but artist is still a no go.
"Past couple of weeks the app quits playing songs. I thought was my (wireless) and non wireless headphones but headphones work fine on another phone. I have a Samsung S8+, if cant get fix will drop this app, I'm paying for."
"since the (great new update) spotify has ruined everything about there app. not only is it frustrating to try and find were to shuffle all my music now. if i want to fibd a specific song or i want to find a artist or song on an album, good luck with that because if you don't have the whole album you'll have to try and remember what its called or try and look for it. Spotify sort this mess out and bring back the old style."
The latest update is pretty bad. I can look at my artists but they are not in any order at all. I cant even see the entire list of them. I just see recommended. Please go back to the old UI.
"over the past 30 days I got only 2 daily mix, isn't suppose to be daily, I'm confused, and when I installed it on my car Android unit the steering wheel buttons didn't work although it works fine with other apps, I was expecting more from a big app like Spotify"
can you please make it so that i can download individual songs to my phone(and an ivon like the like button) instead of the whole library to my phone. it takes up too much space especially if you have a large Library. i dont want to have to add songs to a playlist just to listen to them offline.
Constantly crashes. Very odd behaviour that requires that I force close the application and re-launch it. Often I'm required to reboot my phone before the application will behave normally again. Generally unreliable.
Might have been a UI chage recently which means it won't bring up all the songs I have even downloaded in one list from each artist I follow. Made it much more difficult to get what I want up to listen to.
My earbuds button can't use triple press function to go back. I tried with Samsung AKG and Sennheiser M2 IEG. During searching with Google I found threads from 2017 already mentioning this. Well...it's now 2019 and it still hasn't been fixed!
There's a few things not on there... I used to like this app alot more but a update made my library really almost useless. It's almost quicker to search for artist again than to try to play anything from my library. Another issue I have with it is it is so not in alphabetical order anymore.
This app needs a serious update. I love it but it is soooo annoying when it goes quiet in every song. Usually after a minute it pauses. PLEASE fix this......please....
"Hard to use!! When I searched the artist output shall be list all songs of searched name. Currently, It's hard to found the song I need. Please kindly benmark with Apple Music it's easy to use. I think UX is importance."
Wouldn't mind if the UI was the same as it is on apple devices.. can you add the slide down to close player. its really useful when using a big screen phone. thanks
"I love using Spotify, BUT older android vers. CAN'T PLAY VERTICAL VIDEOS!!! (since last 2 updates. It ruins the fun of having special content from the artist I love. Even after purchasing Premium, I still can't watch vertical videos/art. (P/S: my android ver. is KitKat 4.2.2, not THAT old)"
"I've had spotify for awhile now, I've lived it until recently. The latest UI update is so bad. If another service had a comparable student discount I'd switch right now."
I don't know what the heck is up with the app now! it hasn't been like this before. My music just pauses and when I hit the play button again the song just starts all over. it's very annoying!
"I tried using spotify on my walk tonight like i usually do but for some reason it kept cutting off and had to keep tapping the home button for it to start again or keep it unlocked altogether...very frustrating, please fix as i walk daily and pay for this app. thank you"
"When using Chromecast Built-in music playback frequently hangs on ads and occasionally on some tracks too. Restarting the mobile app restores the advert banner but not playback. It is impossible to recover from that without switching the TV to a broadcast channel and relaunching the mobile app to re-establishing the Chromecast connection. Even then, Spotify insists I should listen to that same advert again and, guess what – it hangs *again* at the same timecode. That's when I switch to YouTube..."
"How is there no way to stop the app, to cancel what you're listening to? So idiotic. I know it's not just me, because there are entire internet forums dedicated to this question. Looking for a suitable replacement. Don't find the ads particularly annoying, but would never pay to upgrade until the app itself is made less obnoxious."
"This app is just annoying. The queue never does what I want it to do. There should be separate buttons for ""play next"" and ""play later."" I want to finish the album I'm listening to now, then move on to the next. I don't know why that's so bloody hard to do. Also, I have no idea what shuffle is doing. it seems like it will only shuffle songs within one album before moving on to the next. I know I'm not the first person to say these things. For God's sake, get over yourselves and make a decent app."
"Had a bad experience because I wanted to change my username. I had a chat messaging with a representative called Paul P. that was very kind and helpful. He helped me aquire the username I desired, plus passed over my content. I was on my first free month subscription at first, but after the username change I didn't get my free Hulu which is one of the reasons I signed on. Long story short, I did as the representative said and upgraded to premium and was charged the $9.99 upfront. still, great app"
"since the latest update Spotify will only play if my phone is unlocked, which defeats the purpose of listening to music while driving, as s I now have to keep my eyes on my phone. try to get this fixed quickly!"
Many songs are missing from Spotify not only english but some hindi songs also. UI of Spotify is really horrible as behind the lyrics is now below now playing screen which is not awesome and short video available for songs are also not available. please do something about it Spotify...
"I love spotify, but the fact that they removed all of my artists and now require me to ""add artists I like"" is infuriating. Now if I want to listen to a specific artist instead of going through my entire liked songs playlist I have to add them, which I already did by liking the song. AND when you go to a specific artist from your list you get their entire profile instead of just the song you liked!! If I wanted to go to their profile, I WOULD.Its stupid and pointless and I hate it soooooo much."
"Dissatisfied and Disappointed. Song radio sucks, I often encounter songs from languages other than my preferred once. UI sucks. You cannot download single track, you need to download the whole playlist. I am premium subscriber and not gonna continue using spotify. I have used Saavn and other similar services, Spotify is the among the once who disappointed me the most. Its just the hoax around the service. Almost no UI for download management. Even account security sucks."
"Why Spotify India doesn't provide some songs which I can be able to listen when I use vpn?? I'm an EXO-L, I want to listen to exos songs but, Spotify India doesn't have their 4th and 5th albums 😡😡😡 do something real quick, and the suggestions suck! I would listen to some songs on loop daily but my suggestions keep suggesting me other songs which I don't like and don't wanna listen and are not related.. fix this."
honestly I gave it 2 because i accidently hit the log out button and now I can't get back in not through email not through anything all my music gone and to top it off I just paid for premium which I didn't even get to use. couldn't even start a new account with premium trial cuz my card already was uses on the account I logged out of why wasn't there a confirmation click that asked me if I was sure I wanted to log out why. Now I'm screwed and I'm gonna get charged!! for what!? an accident! help
"5/14/19 - Since the last update I was kicked out and can't log back in. Or rather, I log in and it loads the homepage and then returns to the login screen before I can do anything else. I'm a premium user. Don't charge me for the service if you can't fix this problem quickly."
"So first if all I love Spotify, by far the best music subscription service ibe used but the new UI that they've made has completely gotten rid of the ""All Songs"" list so I can't just shuffle all the songs in my library, it's just made it so much less convenient to shuffle my music if I don't know what I want to listen to."
"Premium account for a couple of years with no real issues, and I couldn't really fault these clowns, until now. It's a very foolish thing to have quietly begun removing ""premium"" features, which are still missing, weeks later. All while stating it is due a 2 month old, STILL unpatched, buggy update, that doesn't appear to be going anywhere. They don't care and it shows. People are taking note and are now going for the free option. FIX THE EFFEN LOCKSCREEN CONTROLS, IT'S STILL BROKEN"
The music changes halfway through a song while I'm driving. It starts up exactly the same time in the new song that the old one was on. It really ruins the experience.
"I do enjoy this app but, there is a consistent bug which makes an ad banner stay despite pressing the back button. It doesn't let me return to the menu or the list of songs. t's very annoying and kills the experience as the app has to be restarted to fix it."
love the service. Dislike the app because it drains my battery too quickly and the lock screen controls don't work 80% of the time.
I really hate the new version of spotify. Before you can see the list of songs in one album by one click only and one click to those list of songs it will play as a WHOLE tune. Now you can see it but its only in a short clip. Its very frustating. I find it hard to control now because there is no guide. And the list of songs are no longer easy to find. Stupid version. Bring back the old one.
"hi there pls get back to me spotify creators, my spotify had been working great for so long and it is a great app but yesterday it went or strange. when i clicked onto the app it went blank but you could see all the buttons at the bottom like home, search ect. pls tell me what to do. cheers"
The selection of music is nice but I can't find the repeat button. I looked online and they said just tap the three dots in the top right corner. I did that and was greeted with no repeat button. I'll change my review when I find the repeat button.
Have used this app for quite a long time but for some reason in the last few days it's stopped working. when I open the app it's just a blank screen. I can see the options for home/search/library but when I click them the app closes. I've tried closing app/restarting my phone and even re downloading it but nothing is working. occasionally it's let me past but only once or twice in last 3-4 days despite trying regularly.
"Its really good I love it,but when I put on music on my phone it stops after every song after I turn off my phone and it's really annoying when I'm trying to sleep and can't listen to music and then I have to turn it on and press the play button😩"
"sound is good, selection is ok. Problem is app keeps shutting down after a couple songs, so its constantly requiring a restart."
"Used to work fine. With the latest updates, the app's functionality is worst and worst: pause from headphones works rarely, offline mode makes the app unable to start, when the internet connection is not at max quality, say goodbye to the app, doesn't function anymore. Quite bad considering it's my daily driver for music."
"Ads are fine for me but some of these are wrecking the app. I listen to the app with my phone locked and often an ad comes in. The ads ends and it's all fine until the time I open Spotify. The ads appears as an overlay the playlist and the ""dismiss"" button does not and if you click anywhere else it plays whats behind the opaque ad layer. Absolutely nothing more to do but force close the app. FIX IT."
Not Good playing the music that is hidden rather than playing the music that is favoraited on the list how can i play my favorite music? and you needed to be premium for that skip button wth and lastly the when im creating a playlist and added a music the app itself add bunch of random music in the new playlist which is very annoying pls change it to recommend music rather than the app just add bunch of random music in the new playlist directly
"computer app is fantastic but the mobile app is just embarrassing. Where are my downloaded artists, songs, etc. apple music has no issues with this. dont think i will be continuing this service until they fix this"
The app focus only design and nothing more. its teidious and you need multiple clicks to navigate rather than convenience. why did you bury the filter search rather than putting it right above the playlist menu??!
"The ""skip ad"" thing only works for certain ads and it often gives you another ad next. The ads are louder than the music (the volume goes up). There should be a ""don't play this ad again"" button as some of the ads are offensive. There's an ad for ""Australian Beef"" which often comes on after the VEGAN songs in my playlist and an ad which announces loudly that ""IF YOU'VE HAD SEX RECENTLY, YOU COULD HAVE GONNORHEA!"" Try explaining that to your 9 year old child."
"App is quite buggy. Not nearly as polished as expected for an industry standard. Great selection obviously, but playback controls leave me wanting. Why can't they just mimic VLC? I wish it had the ability to queue songs to both next and end of the playlist (play next vs play later). I am currently reinstalling it, and having to re download my entire library, because it was bugging out and giving me a ""you discovered a premium feature!"" message when I was clearly already premium and logged in."
PLEASE FIX THE LOCK SCREEN CONTROLS. I have to unlock my phone and go into spotify everytime I need to pause or change a song because the controls on the lock screen no longer work. My phone registers that I hit the button but nothing happens. It really makes the experience so unpleasant and inconvenient.
need alot of update. Am thankful for bringing Spotify to play store after my complaints. But update for song selection and alot of playlist is missing & even the songs are missing. it's never late but need to be quick fix.
"It has great music, but I cant listen to my playlist on my Amazon Echo as this is a premium feature, which I think is a scam. I think this as I purchased my Alexa with the hope of listening to anything on it, only to have Spotify ruin that. It also adds random music that I dont like to my playlists which I find extremely inconvenient and it automatically shuffles the playlists. You cant download music unless you have a premium account but I dont want to waste a lot of money on this."
ever since they rehauled the UI the app is crashing far too often. it has too many bugs and is unstable in its current form.
"I like spotify's service but the app has lately become terrible. It's slow when it doesn't need to be (e.g. loading offline playlists when on a weak internet connection), generally laggy (e.g. on startup, when showing the three-dot context menu). The interface has constantly become less intuitive, e.g. the queue is no longer directly accessible from the current track screen. The playlist search that has been moved to a context menu. All this used to be better in an earlier version - but WHY??"
"I have had this app for quite a while now and it works really great, however with a recent update I lost the ability to save my downloaded songs to my sd card and I have no idea why. It sucks because I have almost no space on my internal storage and a lot on the sd card. I hope this option will be added back again."
"the new gui after recent update is not good as the previous one. it feels like too much constrained, rather than the previous one which used to have a free flowing interface in almost every direction. this rating is for GUI not for content."
"i am a premium user and love the music experience on Spotify, BUT these stability issues on android 9 (🥧) have to be fixed. i have been putting up with extemely slow page load times for nearly a month. im talking about 15 sec + makes it pretty much un usable. I can no longer recommed spotify to my friends with confidence. Came here to see if i could revert to a previous build. Looks like i cant. maybe time to look elsewhere"
"I really love Spotify. But lately the relationship just isn't working out. Search is broken for me, and support hasn't been able to help. If I can't search and browse for music, what's the point? I've quit my Premium membership, other services aren't as nice, but they do work better. Sorry Spotify, it's you, not me."
"So the app is great. And it works well. And it's able to do well even on Normal data. All good. The problem is with the music or the availability of it. Whatever contractual shenanigans are plaguing Spotify, well they've led to Spotify having a piss poor collection of music. Many notable bands like for example slipknot and stone sour among many others have no songs on the platform in India. Others like anthrax don't have their newer stuff. They need their contracts stuff done for this to work."
"i like this app so much when it comes to music but the new update ruins everything it exit randomly and the song is automatically playing even though i didn't pick a song to play, please fix this immediately"
"Awful since the last update. Crashing, or taking forever to load. Spotify customer service told me to restore my phone to factory settings to fix 🤣. They need to look at all the comments on here and quickly realise it's the app that's the problem. Does anyone have a recommendation for a music streaming service because if it's not fixed soon I'm going somewhere else."
A major slipback! there is no repeat button for the playlist in the application however in the pc version we have the repeat button please look through it and get this app a looping button.
"I can't believe I paid for a year's subscription without doing my research. Whatever experience Ive had with Spotify before the Indian release has been so good that I quit other apps. As soon as it launched in India and being loyal to the whole developer community I purchased a yearly subscription only to realize due to copyright issues with Warner music countless artists don't show up on the Spotify which a big bummer. Artists like Led Zeplin, LP, David Bowie etc to name a few. Disappointed 😥"
"I'd give 5 stars if there was a button to add an entire album to a playlist After leaving the house and losing wifi music slowly deltes itself throughout the day. Also its started to play random unsaved songs while ""playing a playlist."" At this rate if it keeps getting worse I'll gladly uninstall Spotify."
update broke my ability to seek through it podcast with my car stereo. now my seek controls skip to the next track.apparently to Spotify developers are trying to kill me by forcing me to open my phone navigate to the current track playing screen and hit the seek ahead 15 seconds button.
"Music content is great but the app itself is super confusing. Still haven't figured out how to build a queue on the fly and reorder the songs. I wish it was more like the Sonos app, which is so easy to use."
"good at first but now im having multiple playback issues and the app keeps crashing. pretty upset, it started with bluetooth but now it doesnt matter it crashes mid song and makes it start over 60% of the time. super bummed please look into it. spring break is next week, i have bangers to play but i need to be confident that the app wont fail and ruin the stoke while im on aux. if you can fix this app is great. if not ill have to accept my fate as untrustworthy aux guy."
"I've used Spotify Premium for over 4 years and every update to the UI never fails to make the app more cumbersome and frustrating. The newest update looks terrible, why I want to heart a song in a playlist? It took 4 months to change the settings bug where canvas couldn't be turned off without turning on Data Saver (which greatly reduced the audio quality, and who the hell wants to watch the same 8 seconds of video looping?) PLEASE ALWAYS HAVE A VIEW QUEUE BUTTON WHY WOULD I EVER NOT WANT THAT"
"Recent updates have removed landscape mode for the ""Now playing"" screen and have broken the ""Play/Pause"" intent. No longer suitable for use on my car stereo. Please bring these features back!"
"The latest update makes my phone crash or freeze as soon as I try to play a song. And on top of that, it almost ruined my phone so that I couldn't boot it correctly. Other than that, it's a great app."
"i have been a spotify user for about 2 years now, and for the 2 or 3 past days, there have been countless bugs and buffering, so bad at times that it totally FROZE MY PHONE and i had to restart it. this new updaye has been such a problem for me since i have to use aux for my youth group for our fellowships. this would have been a 5 star and above if there was none of this craziness, so please fix your update, thank you!"
"used this app for a long time, mostly via bluetooth in my car. latest update has caused it to not be recognised my my vehicle, I have to manually connect every time. (used to be automatic) it freezes often so I have to open the app to get it to play again and it won't allow me to skip songs using the steering wheel buttons like it has done for years. started listening to the radio more often than not because it doesn't freeze! so will more than likely cancel my subscription if it doesn't improve"
The last update ruined everything. the music randomly stops after 3 tracks and the app is randomly closes itself sometimes. After the reboot my downlanded music is unavailable and I need to download all the 400 tracks again.. Also the offline mode turns itself off after I left the app...
"Mobile app is not intuitive. Playlist folders is a major feature for me, I need to have a shuffle all play lists within a folder on mobile. Please add this feature back to android / ios"
"Shuffle play when playing a playlist sucks. When I select to shuffle play the songs in my playlist it plays one, maybe two songs from my playlist and then starts playing songs not from my playlist and never seems to get back to the playlist. Apparently this is an issue with streaming on a mobile device and quite possibly just for free accounts. Still, it sucks and makes me never want to waste money on a subscription."
"I pay for premium so I can download a listen offline, but yet it still requires a connection to show what you already have? Weird. Also, with the most recent update, you can't select an artist beyond one album? If I wanted that I'd just pull out my CD collection..."
Popular Music app but too many Cons there... 1) App Crashes too mch 2) Limited Collection of Songs and If present they are Unavailable 3) UI interface got Worse 4) Difficult to find the Exact song for the Album
"Was looking forward to Spotify in India, quite a bit but it seems like my one year membership will go to waste. Very limited content with regular bombarding of Bollywood music for some reason and poor UI with no option to view the entire list of songs of an artist. Amazon music is a much better and cheaper option it seems."
"Since latest update the App just stops in the middle of a song. I have to go back in, re open the app and the same song restarts all over. I'm done, embarrassing when riding in the car with your co workers. I'll stick to the free version instead of continuing to pay."
"new update has ruined app. crashes, music pauses mid song if im not in the Spotify app itself, can no longer use car steering wheel controls songs that have down loaded locally disapear. list goes on (android osx s9 +)"
have to make a playlist to listen to individual songs but even then why must you add 20 songs to a playlist that made the whole experience difficult and having lost the ability to make my own playlist ruins it for me. only reason it is a two star is because of the playstation app that alows everything old spotify did exept im not aware of being able to make playlists on the playstation app .
"recent update is trash, reorganization is horrible and the sonos speaker issue is so inconvenient. also cant use car buttons to change music, ain't that just super unsafe?"
Spotify used to be my absolute favourite app. It was the only music streaming service with a dark colour scheme and a good UI. The most recent UI update is awful and makes navigating my library a chore. The interface needs to go back or my subscription is being cancelled.
Latest update with playback via bluetooth on galaxy s9 keeps cutting out every couple of minutes. You then need to press the next track button in order for it to restart. very frustrating.
I honestly love the app but one of the more recent updates has ruined it for me. I hate how I can no longer skip as many songs as I wanted and am not limited to 6 per hour. I didnt mind getting the ads after skipping songs. I hate how I can no longer go back songs in the event I want to. I came here when mixrado got shutdown and now I feel like yall want me to leave because I cant pay for premium.
This UI is not easy to use. Android Auto is a mess it doesn't work half of the time have to use my phone to get the music that I wamt
"since update, I can no longer use app in my car. hands free buttons dont respond with app unless screen is always on. once screen turns off the music stops playing."
this app use to work perfectly. it works at home thro my sonos speakers fine but when I'm in the car using the bluetooth the songs keep cutting out I can barely get through an entire song without it cutting out. I cant use the skip buttons on front of phone the only way is by opening the app bk up. plz fix this spotify as loved this but thinking off changing. from a s9 user
"can we call it ""stopify"" ?!....... songs keep stopping and restarting on bluetooth connections and even when only playing on device , very frustrating . love the app apart from the recent nuisance"
"Found lot's of bugs. 1) I was listening with Bluetooth headset, I hit pause button, the music stopped but then when I'm hitting play button on headset the song isn't playing. I've to open my phone and play it manually. 2) If you select your custom playlist -> go to add new song -> search for the song -> the add button isn't working."
"Pros: Excellent sound quality, great ""background"" functionality. Somewhat limited library. Completely non-intuitive and restrictive playlist and playback. Even the oldest Winamp or Windows Media Player are more user friendly in that sense."
"For non premium users, too many ads which seem to go on forever, 4 ads in a row is too many all of which are 30 seconds long, totally ruins the music."
There is no option to edit your queue nor there is a repeat button for your songs. I faced this issue after an update. Please fix it as soon as possible. Thank you !
"It's amazing how you guys manage to make the app worst at every update. I hated the UI change, now I can't see properly what I recently listened therefore making annoying to find the songs I've recently listened. Some songs I had in my library were gone too. The only thing kept the same were my downloaded songs, but seriously, I don't know why I'm still using Spotify."
"I was so excited to finally see Spotify launch here in India. I subscribed to the service on the day of launch and cancelled my Google play music subscription. I like the UI and the the quality of streaming is better to my ears. The artist discovery and radio feature is what I was looking forward to the most but unfortunately for a metalhead like me, the library which is available doesn't cover most of the bands I listen to. Even amazon prime music has that covered. So until then only 2 stars."
"Everytime my phones screen turns off, the music stops playing. Then it'll play again when I turn the screen on. This only happens when i use the auxiliary cable with it."
"brilliant app in the past, been a subscriber for a few years now. over the last 2-3 months iv had loads of issues with music cutting off when my phone locks and if iv got a playlist going it doesn't let me skip unless it's in the app. needs to improve quickly or I might cancel."
"Was great until recently, now it quite frequently keeps playing music, but is shown as ""not responding,"" therefore bluetooth controls don't function at all. Widget freezes up and doesn't do anything until i close the app entirely, and then have to reopen it."
New update is horrible. I have to press three buttons to search my liked songs before I had to press zero. Not to mention my likes songs were in a specific order and now they've been shuffled for some reason. Probably going to unsubscribe if it's not reverted back or fixed soon. If it ain't broke don't fix it.
"crashes all the time. takes at least 10 seconds to register me hitting the skip button. constantly continues to play music after i have shut down the app, and doesnt respond to any controls anymore. i am infuriated at how terrible the android app for spotify is."
"I am highly annoyed with the new update to spotify, its completly changed the layout meaning all music i had down loaded from artists are now non existent, unless it is set as a playlist. I really loved the way it was set up before so I could choose between listening to any song I had down loaded or the artist, this latest update ruins any chance of that happening"
"Spotify before the update was 5 stars. spotify now is genuinely so much worse. the interface is much messier, I can't see artists anymore from songs I've saved. I can't use the app unless it is open anymore ie switch songs. fix it asap or simply revert back to the old format which was much much better"
"Unable to listen to podcasts on Android Auto, there's clear indication for demand of this feature on the forums as a quick Google will show. Very disappointed that this feature is not available."
"The newsest Spotify update SUCKS! Why do I have to tap extra buttons to search for my downloaded songs when before, it was already at the top. The same goes for sorting the music the way that I like. Go back to the pre update layout please. Also, why are all my albums gone now?!"
"Missing of many songs I want to listen. ""We're working hard to get more music on Spotify to your region"" that's a silly excuse. Need to be improved quickly. Waiting for the best."
"I have created playlists songs I want to hear, and instead it plays all these other songs that I don't want. you used to be able to have a few skips an hour, haven't been able to do that in quite some time. used to like the app, now I can't really stand it."
the sound quality is bad.. got interrupted while listening to the music by some wired sound. it happens quite frequently. very annoying
"Discover Weekly and the other recommendations are great, but the app is slow, buggy and poorly designed. It could be so much better!"
Latest update renders this app useless. I'm a premium user yet i cant play any track. There is a serious issue with shuffle - the button is inactive. I cabt even shffle play let alone see my playlist.
"app has some serious flaws: Spotify connect drops regularly, connection is dropped or reset by app. app interface not really intuitive. switching from playlist to queue or vice versa shows strange behaviour. app hangs in playlist or queue and doesn't want to play different playlist. had to reinstall bug: when in connect mode, playlist ain't possible to delete/switch/change. first back to phone mode amd then back again to Spotify connect."
where the hell shuffle button in my playlist?? no way to shuffle songs in my playlist or anywhere in the app settings grrrr this frustrating such a basic functionality why can't you guys put an icon on the player????? if you guys want me to redesign the UX reach me
"have a lot of bugs in the app of we are playing on another device using the android app. the player usually structs and the song which is being played is another and which os shown is another. pls fix the app. as we have a lot of love for Spotify but first impression is the last , and it's only 2-3 days since you launch in india the volume control button also lags if we are playing on another device even if internet connection is very good"
you dont allow playlists to have a shuffle option. besides that I cant play a song on repeat. i searched for the option everwhere. if the option is there make it more easy to access and if not then add it. I love to hear the songs I like on loop often for hours so without this feature this app has a major fault for me. plus the recommendation is really scace. like/dislile button missing. would change the rating as soon as it gets improved
"I'm unable to view my library as albums as the page won't load, even after a clean install. The app crashes frequently during use. The UI focus is on pushing towards Spotify's own playlists which is frustrating as I just want to listen to albums and there are no customisability options to make this better. Very few albums I want are missing from the library, however. I would switch to another service but the student discount makes that hard to warrant, even with the lackluster app."
"It's been crashing for some time now. The latest update has made it buggy with android Pie. I can no longer use my cars controls to control songs while connected via Bluetooth. I have to open the app on the phone everytime to skip and restart. On top of that, regularly, the skip and rewind buttons stop working on the actual phone lock screen. Again, this means I have to open the app. Also, the songs now regularly stop playing in general for now reason. Shame, because the app used to be flawless."
"1. Yes, an internet connection IS available, your app is the only one that doesn't acknowledge it. 2. Oh, and I've downloaded that playlist, so why do you require a connection to display it? Combine bugs 1 and 2 for a uniquely frustrating user experience."
"The app always cuts out mid song and won't play until I hit the play button again, does it for every song, uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't fix it. I've gone through settings and can't see anything that would make a difference or help which really sucks as I used to enjoy having Spotify on my phone, now it's just taking up space as I don't want to use it while it continues to be a hassle every time."
"There have been many times when i have wanted to delete your app because of the excessive amount of ""Join Spotify Premium"". What you are doing there is ruining my experience with your app."
"issues with Bluetooth earplugs, i dont know if its spotify or the last samsung udate but i can no longer control spotify(like i could before the update) with my earplugs like starting/stoping music or change song in playlist, only thing that works is when i change the volume.. the rest have to be done through the phone directly since the buttons on the plugs do nothing...."
"it's great and has a ton of songs but when you make a Playlist, they ""add"" ""related songs"" and ruins your Playlist with songs you can't remove without paying."
"New to Spotify. While I'm enjoying the dealsktop experience, the inability to turn off shuffle on my mobile device has left me discouraged from using the service more. It's a counter-intuitive, contrived way to get subscriptions, and it's not for me."
there is no normal play button so i have to shuffle play and when i do it plays some random song they added and i cant delete it since whenever i try to it only says it is hidden so you have to listen to the stupid songs they automatically put in and you can never delete them from your playlist. sorry if it was too long.
"So far, horrible experience. Hate the app. I downloaded it, because it is getting increasingly hard to play a song in the background for free, so I was basically forced into this. I wanted to listen to Bread - Guitar man. I found it in the search, but it just played like 5 seconds of it and stopped and started playing somethig else. What is this?? The song was found so why cannot I play it? Why is there no info about it there? Is it not available in my country in full? Do I have to pay exta??"
Whatever feature causes a transition from the standard UI to the fullscreen album art/ video has got to be one of the bigger oversights I've seen in an app. It's so frustrating to have every other song fill the entire screen with background video with no way to opt-out in the settings.
"Keeps crashing and have to restart app, quite frustrating when listening to music in car as have to pull up and get music playing again having same problem with iOS? I am a premium member as it is an amazing app when works, also the full screen mode should be on all tracks as makes it look much better."
"Best music app I have used but needs lots of work. On Samsung S9 the shuffle and repeat buttons are gone and I cant get of shuffle. Also when I press a song it doesn't play. Also when clicking on an artist, you cant see all their albums. Fixing these will give it a 5 star."
"It was annoying enough that there's a limit to how many songs you can add to your library (honestly, only 10000 songs in 2019? That's only a 10th of what Apple Music offers and has been a known problem with articles dating back to 2013 online) but now I can't even view artists discographies because you updated the view and broke the ""see discography"" button. Spotify just hates folk that wanna listen to albums over playlists doesn't it?!"
"The latest update now involves extra steps to find and sort music in your playlists. This seems like a step backwards in design and usability. The easily accessible search and sort function still exists under ""All songs"". I don't understand why this is not extended to playlists"
I pay for this service and if you can't get this fixed to where it quits randomly changing songs and connecting to some device I dont have automatically I will go somewhere else. I've been a loyal customer for years and the last update did nothing to fix this issue. Get it together!
"Over past week, spotify randomly logs me out and i have to log back in - even in the middle of a song playing, very annoying and poor user experience!"
"Good idea bad realisation. ui is not very intuitive an the app has issues. it often stops/block in the middle of a song, then need to restart."
"Generally unstable, often deletes downloaded music from my phone by itself. They changed how sorting and searching in playlists works hiding them inside menu's which is insanely annoying. The scrollbar also does not work if you are at the top of the list as it thinks youre trying to open the menu. Terrible UI overall."
Hugely disappointed. Signed up for premium thinking that I could use the app on my Galaxy Watch so I could listen to my playlists offline whilst exercising. Turns out that I can use this app on my phone in Qatar but it isn't available for the Galaxy Watch here so I'll be quickly cancelling that premium subscription. The free version will suffice for what I need it for now.
App is excellent but recently the ads dont dismiss from the screen even tho there is an option to. clicking on the dismiss button does nothing. I need to exit the app and restart again
"well, it a grate app but when you go on other big games/apps it realty ruins it. it starts to sound like a robot. I guess with the app/game might interpret a bit but not that bad, please fix this. when I found this out I was really disappointed. if it wasn't for this issue it would be a 5 star, brill app. I just use it when on big games witch is seems like it struggles to do. and to make it worse it only works when using headphones. I'm not that type of person who blasts music out of there phone"
"Good app, but even on premium you still get new album pop ups? Also the text on the UI sometimes gets stuck even if you go to a different sections, it's just overlayed on the new page. I have just descovered you guys do random surveys like if i go to university? how greedy can you get. We PAY to get rid of ADs you add your own AD."
"I recently got premium and now features like making a playlist and downloading songs are extremely buggy.It took a day before the music started to download, and when i make a playlist it says the maker of the playlist is 'null' and wont open. This should be fixed as quick as possible as these are two big selling points of premium."
"The android app is a mess. Missing features compared to the free version and the iOS version, like the 'Don't play this' button. So still no way to block artists."
"plays all the music you never wanted to hear. can't shuffle large playlists. not sure why anyone would pay for this service. App is not intuitive, and continually frustrates me. tried playing a playlist of a kids movie and was given songs not associated with it, some with explicit lyrics."
"The service is fantastic, the app needs a lot of improvement. I love paying for the spotify music catalog as it features everything I could ever ask for. The app needs serious UX overhaul as car mode or big buttons are not present. It is extremely difficult to perform simple tasks and voice recognition support is missing, I do it through Google assistant, man... So I give 5 stars for spotify as a service, and one to 2 stars to the app developers. Please do better."
I just use it to play mp3 files from newgrounds because my built in music app keeps hiding my songs so and i don't listen to the other songs much so i can't say much about the music streaming. I have two big issues with this the first issue is that this one song i have Realms by Hinkik occasionally causes spotify to crash. It also will make it so i can put song in que meaning they wont automatically play after the previous song. These issues really annoy me so im gonna look for a new mp3 player.
"After using Spotify family for years, the latest update completely destroyed our account, and when it was resolved, deleted all playlists and downloads. Not good enough. Also don't like the new layout. If I search a song and play it from a play list, I can't see how to view that playlist anymore. Quite annoying."
good music experience except the app refuse to work on my phone whenever there is an ad has to restart every time... the quick bar also displays the wrong title at times or no title at all yet music still playing. please fix
"The user interface is appalling; totally counter intuitive, riddled with usability bugs and often surprising in a bad way. Why can't you just write a simple player that works like all the other ones except that it's streaming from your servers instead of reading local files?"
"Used to be better. Horrible ui. ""Random songs after playlist"" enabled by default. No, I don't want to hear Nickelback after Slipknot... Impossible to see all songs by an artist. Trying to listen to songs stored locally with crappy internetconnection doesn't work (as in leaving the apartment and still connected to the wifi,but 0 coverage). Would swap if someone else had the same sized musiclibrary."
"Spotify is a great app, but me not being able to triple click my headphones to go to the previous song ruins much of the experience. I am able to do this on iOS. This issue has been around for several years, please fix :)."
I use this app everyday but now I can't even make Playlist ls now because it goes to some bad suggested song and I'm never actually able to listen to the music I want to and it gets very annoying this even happens in my favorite songs which makes no sense what so over this completely ruins the app the worst part is that you can't even switch songs so you're stuck I'm a loop of listening to bad music you don't want to listen to please fix this
"today spotify keeps freezing and I can't press any buttons. then it goes black. I have to close it, several times, before it'll work again. gimmick to get me to buy premium? hmmmm"
"Spotify as a service is great, but their UI and app are atrocious. Overnight they seem to have just disabled the ability to store songs on an SD card, forcing me both to download EVERYTHING again and blocking downloads until I clear out enough space for everything. Ridiculous decision to drop support, which was clearly intentional due to the setting disappearing. The app is shockingly buggy & slow when you aren't in a healthy reception area, scrollbars are abominations and loses place regularly"
"I mean, it plays music but it's really not a super well designed app. generally unintuitive ai and I often get the feeling that it just ignores some settings."
"Fantastic music experience! The ads are getting out of control. I get you have to pay for the premium ad free version but starting to play 3 video clip ads back to back is too much!! App is starting to become buggy: the play button is overexposed, the notification panel doesn't update the songs according to what's playing and the like button is buggy."
"I have a huge problem when I want to listen music from the playlists or the menus which I want to select. They are loading very slow. I have a premium account and I am very disappointed about this. What should I have to do, to have a more smooth and quick response from the app?!"
"I know that the cost of music is expensive but Spotify shouldn't say ""free streaming"" when you can't even enjoy the songs you're listening to. I don't get why they have to shuffle songs below the required number if you're not subscribed, it's just ridiculous. Why do I need to shift to premium if I can just uninstall it?"
Lots of bugs. The notification banner never matches with the artist currently playing. Issues with pause/play. Cannot remove app icon from remaining active and in notifications. Often requires manual kill of the Spotify processes in developer options of the phone.
It's great but you have to pay to get so many features and it is really hard to listen to anything without it playing a shuffled playlist that requires more than 10 songs in order for it not to add a bunch of other songs you don't listen to. Great app though.
It's UI/UX feels poorly thought out. It has trouble syncing to my car's Bluetooth. And the service does a terrible job integrating with Google Assistant
Cannot listen to podcast episodes from oldest to newest without having to manually move between the episodes. Daily mixes quickly become the same ten songs every day with no easy way to clear them or change them up.
"Auto video play with no option to turn it off?! Seriously?! Spotify is already my main consumer of data since I use it almost ALL day everyday but now I'm reconsidering this app seeing as I can't just leave my phone to play music and trust that it's not going to overcharge my data with these useless and music videos. The worst part is that on their website SO many people have been complaining about this since it came out and they stated that they have NO PLANS TO CHANGE THIS but have added it to a ""good idea"" list... Thousands of complaints and a year later... Follow suit and ATLEAST add a wifi only auto play option like every other social media app has."
stop changing functions to be harder to find and access. moving the search and sort playlist features from just swiping the screen down to the bottom of another menu is really dumb and unintuitive.
The amount of ad spamming is over the top. Heres a quick 30 second ad to listen to free music ... followed by another 30 second ad ... followed by an ad. Nothing's for free but your ads are the joke.
"i have premium and it works wonders with my laptop. however the mobile version is less and less usable on my mobile device (a smartphone)... the app force closes randomly (it usually happens after skipping songs) (and i cant even report the crash, because the app just resets itself without prompting me to report the issue, very inconvenient for yoy guys, since you wouldn't know the specific circumstances of these errors, and it would make fixing all this all the more difficult...), the queue feature does not work anymore (songs on queue won't olay as if i had never set up a queue in the first place), and i have to keep the app open so it keeps playing music, because otherwise it will stop after three songs or so - even if i am on wi-fi. quite honestly these problems become worse with each update, which is a shame because it is an otherwise wonderful program. it /does/ work as intended on my other mobile device (a tablet) which is way older - but not on my phone! it's frustrating... i hope fixes are applied soon for my device model/operating system, because these issues severely decrease my enjoyment from the app, which is a service i pay for. but i count on you, spotify programming team!"
Good on the surface but a lot of crippling bugs. Gets stuck loading a LOT and they make arbitrary interface changes on a monthly basis that don't improve the app whatsoever. Sounds like uxui teams are really tryna keep their jobs...
Recent update removed the ability for me to filter for songs within my playlists. They've gone and hidden it behind 3 menu taps. Very unintuitive. Bring it back!
The new update takes 4 scrolls to show 11 songs on Android Auto. It's displaying songs in large cards instead of a list now and it's incredibly unintuitive.
"Great in theory, but it takes forever to search for anything or even load anything downloaded to your device. Really bad UI. And it rarely autoplays when your vehicle connects to bluetooth so your rummaging IB your pocket to play your music and then waiting for the damn app to get going."
"Would give it a better review but the constant connectivity issues and reliability of the app is putting me off and am switching over to Apple music as soon as I find some time and way to transfer my playlists over. Another complaint, albeit minor, is this clunky UI which I feel is trying to be intuitive but ends feeling slow and limited"
Annoying recommendations when I just want to loop my playlist. Many no intuitive design decisions. Many songs missing in the catalogue with only some poor replacements made by unknown artists. No high quality streaming support in the app that you get in desktop client. And many more...
"I love this app, but since the latest update it became terrible, No going back in playlist, no moving in the song time, 6 skips for an hour, come on, really ruined, it become really bad, I changed my using to another app now"
"The app has become pretty rubbish, it's home screen only displays one big album art at a time. That doesn't help me at all. They are trying to shove premium down my throat too much now with a whole button dedicated. I'm definitely using YouTube Music now"
Every button works 60 sec. after I touch. This is also happening when I try to switch between online and offline mode. I want to use this usefull app but it is not usefull for me unfortunately.
Keeps showing a notification saying connecting to Spotify even if I have it open playing music. I have to force quit the app to get the notice to go away.
It says 30 mins of add free music. I've never made it 20 minutes. Lastly it quits be For I can take a shower. 2 songs and it turns off
For an app that requires a monthly payment it is incredibly glitchy and is constantly crashing. The variety in music is dwarfed by the fact that it's so difficult to search for and save songs without encountering an issue. Fix the bugs and this could be a decent app
"Loved this app until the recent update. I pay for premium because it used to be worth it, but now whenever I try to load a full album by someone it refuses to load. I don't get why they change things that ruin the functionality of the app..."
The last update has made Spotify pretty much unusuable on my phone. The search function either doesn't work or it's so chaotically designed that I am unable to find what I am looking for.
new version of that app is horrible. since the bottom menu changed to 3 buttons everything is harder to get to. hidden behind extra clicks. the old home page was much more useful to be able to access and discover music. change seems to be made for sake of change. over simplifying the interface has made for a worse experience.
"No long term solutions here. If you think this service could last you a lifetime it capped me out at five years. Hi, I'm zach and I've had spotify premium since I was a sophomore in high school. That was almost five years ago. Over time I have built up a 'epic collection' according to spotify but according to them I've filled my library and cant save anymore songs. The cap is 10,000 songs. I still listen to almost all of it, as hard as that is to believe but because of this limit it makes it hard to believe spotify is good source to listen to music if I cant even save all of my music. Please up the cap for everyone, it's a bad idea if I cant keep my music in one place and I'm paying monthly. If the cap was increased this app has the potential I thought it would. To last me forever but obviously it's not the case. Think twice and read carefully before you buy premium if you think this is the next itunes. I apologize to spotify as i love the service but this is a down side I cant look past and for anyone who would use your service for an extended amount of time, as I have, shouldnt loom past either. Please increase my library maximum capacity because even if only ""1% of members are reaching the limit"" eventually everyone will and its gonna be something you will have to confront anyway or lose people like me who came to the service because we love the service."
App seems to get slower and worse with each update. It is ridiculously slow to load parts the UI when on Wi-Fi. Constantly says no internet connection.
New update has terrible UI. I can't even see what songs are on an album. What a huge step back for an app that ran smooth and well before. Hope it changes soon
"Spotify is by far the slowest app on my Android phone. It freezes while streaming, cannot even mute the audio. Terrible user experience."
I've been using Spotify for while and I always had trouble to get it started on my S9. It's quite slow to start also it always hard to change the playlist. Definitely not worthy to pay monthly for something that doesn't work properly.
Super glitchy. Like/dislike buttons don't work. Unable to simply search for a song in My Library. Says I'm offline when I'm not. Very tempted to cancel after trial period.
I used to love this app but then my autoplay button stopped working and it would automatically play other songs similar to the ones that I listen to. I tried to turn it off multiple times and I even uninstalled and reinstalled it and it still didn't work. Very disappointed about that.
"Unintuitive, poorly designed UI. Theres a lot of little annoying quirks to get around, and you can just forget about teaching anyone over 50 to navigate the app."
"The free version is decent... sometimes. Every now and then they will interrupt their ads playlist with some music but don't worry, playing music happens less and less. Joking aside, you will sometimes get a ""watch this short ad to get 30 min of uninterrupted music"", if you accept, you will get an ad, followed by...another add and a message with ""enjoy 30 min of uninterrupted music"" followed by YET ANOTHER AD! Well done Spotify, great UX!"
Broken radio and downloading functionality. App UI is very cluttered compared to competitors. Seems to have the Netflix model where finding what you want is less important than seeing what Spotify wants you to see. Offline mode is very neutered and library functions are poor.
"It plays ads at random, even when the app is off. Navigation through the app pages is the worst. wont play song in my playlists that I chose, continues to play random songs, ruins my mood"
"Disappointed with their newest update, the design isn't any better, the list preview is just all jumbled together. Some of my music disappeared too so thanks for that Spotify."
"Within the last couple of days the app has constantly been shutting down mid-use. I'm using a Huawei Mate SE. I've already tried uninstalling and clearing the cache but it continues to shut off when I use the app. It seems to be okay when the app is not onscreen, however whenever Its onscreen for too long it will force quit and cease all functions."
"This app is really convenient, with the ability to stream (almost) anything (almost) everywhere. But my experience has worsened over the months I've been using it. At first my gripes were with the ugly, featureless, uncustomizable UI. Moving from Foobar to Spotify is like moving from kit from Knight Rider to a rickshaw with no pedals or driver. And AFAIK Spotify has discontinued support for third party clients which is ludicrous considering their POS client. If someone reading this has no problem with Spotify's UI. Imagine if you could sort your music by year released, add your own genre tags and bring up all your music tagged ""rock"" and ""rap"" and shuffle that. Imagine you could change the appearance of your client, so that obnoxious vomit green isn't all over your screen. This, coupled with the fact that as I've added playlists and albums to my library my client has slowed considerably, such that opening the app on any platform takes a minute before I can do anything, minus Linux which ""only"" takes 30 seconds. In conclusion, Spotify revitalise your support for the creation of third party apps, and after a working Foobar plugin gets created I'll change this review to a 5. Edit: app started freezing and crashing on my new phone too."
Thank you Spotify for destroying my sd memory card. And loading time is equal to eternity... I have a 4g connection. Fun fact when earphones are plugged in it takes 15 minutes for app to find something trough search and then another 15 minutes to load that page you were looking for. But when you jack out earphones it's about 5min to search and another 5 minutes to open. App consumes slot of battery. My emui 5.0 always pops the message that Spotify is consuming too much power. I love music but due to this prank I have to buy new SD card and I'll never install Spotify again don't want to burn another one. Music is okay 👌
"Only shuffle play mode is not ok, I mean in certain albums there's a reason for the order of the songs so I don't want shuffle play.... Also viewing Playlist songs is not available? Adding random songs to an album is a nice idea but there should be a button to toggle this on or off. All together these functions are not useful and rather annoying, hope these are only temporary and are fixed quick. Saw other peoples ratings which say similar things to mine, so I'm not the only on having a problem with this 😶"
"Very spotty. Random updates to the App that limits usage and what can I say about those adds?! They are not genre specific and they play louder than the music you're listening to!! Totally ruins my moment when I'm listening to a relaxing classical piece! And please don't bring up the argument of ""if you don't want the adds, Pat for the full version"". How about if you don't intend of offering a truly "" free"" product, just don't!"
Like Spotify cares whether or not paying customers like this mentally arthritic app. No track numbers Constantly complains of not being connected to the Web when playing local playlists NEVER remembers where you paused the playlist necessitating having to scroll and try to remember where you were...again when not connected Constantly deleting downloaded playlists. I will be discontinuing my subscription soon. I am paying for an app that is garbage!!!
"This app is full of bugs. Loading songs takes way too long, loading thumbnails also. Switching between online and offline mode is not intuitive. Search options are awful."
Stupid as needs to stop saying 30 mins of add free listening if you watch the video cause yall play an ad right after not only that yall have a no thank you option that doesnt pop up until its to late & its not even a button yall just doing to much tryna penny pinch. cut that ish out
"Newest update made it so that Spotify can't find Sonos as a device to play the music through, instead i have to go through Sonos manually to listen to Spotify, and there with less functions. The 'Play song radio', 'view album' and 'view artist' buttons no longer work either as they have been greyed out. This needs a fix ASAP!"
"The app crashes and requires multiple restarts especially when using the remote service. It does not work properly with Linux streaming services and the high definition stream rate is mediocre at best. 320 kbps shouldn't be classed as a high definition service. The application also shouldn't need to be restarted in order to pause playback for a remotely controlled device. Good option to use for finding new music, but the library search is not the most streamlined."
Too many pop up ads that don't go away it just made me waste all my skips trying to push the button to dismiss an ad. Like what? Not cool and also an ad ever 5 to 10 min is honestly too much
Recent version of app has been buggy. Freezes on displaying a particular song. Can skip to new songs using buttons but no update to screen. Also randomly stops playing. Frustrating for a paid service.
"I like the online services but the app fails to integrate with Android well, missing play/pause buttons on the drop down menu more often then not, crashes. I have the Family subscription yet I can play on multiple devices or homespeakers. A real pain. Galaxy S8 / Google home /home mini. Not exotic tech is it."
Spotify needs to completely rework their Android app. It's really making me consider switching to GPM or Apple music. Terrible UI and very buggy lately.
"If you're using a full screen/button-less phone, make sure that you're not caught in-app while the ads are playing or you won't be able to exit till the ads finish playing. Highly annoying 🙄"
It has all the music you'll ever need but the UI is painfully laggy at times. It's also constantly either getting stuck in offline mode or trying to search the web when I'm offline (seriously so annoying) and sometimes large amounts of downloaded music just disappears. I love Spotify but I'm being honest when I say I'm looking at other services for music rn
App was great until recent update for Note 8. Now everything is glitched such as play buttons and nothing shows on the notifications screen. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Fix or deleting my account.
"Newest update completely ruined the app. Almost every aspect is bugged, and it's more of a chore than anything else to listen to music."
"I love Spotify Premium. But this app is too buggy! It says I'm offline when I'm not, sometimes the music randomly just stops playing for no reason, sometimes the app quits for no reason, often the notification disappears but music is still playing and the app becomes unresponsive. Please fix these bugs Spotify"
"Since the last update it crashes, when skipping songs on my lock screen it doesn't update the information but changes the song. Sometimes in the app when hitting skip it doesn't update the ui but does skip.... I wish I could uninstall the last update. My friend also has a Samsung s9 and has the exact same issues."
"There are certain complications that ruins the experience for me, especially for an android user, it's better on the iPad in comparison, way better."
"All my Downloaded music has disappeared several times; there is no support readily available; the faq gives 4 or 5 possible solutions, which either don't apply or require tons of work; a company this size should have a helpline , particularly if so many people complain about the same major issue!!!!"
"I love the app, but there's one feature that HAS TO BE IMPROVED.. PLEASE! There's a playlist called ""Discover Weekly"", from what I understand it's supposed to be built every week with music related to the songs I usually listen to..  Well.. I love rock music.. alternative/punk rock etc.. but I hate ""Growling"" (that part when the vocalist is screaming and destroying his own vocal chords) for some reason that ""discover weekly"" algorithm can't seem to track the fact I am skipping any song with growlings the second they appear.. I find lots of cool songs that I like in that playlist, but 50% of them contains that thing that I hate, which is a huge bummer for me..  Can you please fix this?"
The mobile app just fails to deliver an intuitive user interface. Sometimes music is playing in the background and suddenly the app dies. Sometimes it just doesn't stop playing music when watching a video on other app.
"Sorry for the bad review, I love the concept of Spotify but the app itself is poor. It keeps bugging especially with searching for music: constantly telling me that ""Something went wrong"" and that it cant connect to the internet but I can listen to Songs I havent saved. The Issue has been common in every version but in the newest one (15.09) i cant search for new songs at all. Also it keeps stoping the musik for no reason (no buttons were pressed)"
"The new interface is awful!!! Cant use landscape mode while playing a song, the repeat button is now hidden and I'm unsubscribing premium because of this garbage"
