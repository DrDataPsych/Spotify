Please change back the play button to where it was! ‚èÆ‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚è≠ The new design (‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚èÆ‚è≠) is neither practical nor aesthetically pleasing. Update: it's back to normal :D
Great... fantastic...SPOTIFY was designed especially for me (With me in mind). Thank you.
"Beautiful graphics, lively navigation, refreshing designs, and sound clarity. I've been using Amazon Prime Music for over a year because it doesn't have ads but I abandoned it for Spotify; you could imagine why would anyone drop an ad-free app to come back to a limited service: quality!"
One of the better music streaming platform has a variety of recommendations and custom made Playlist designed just for you.
"Good for designing a playlist, bad for c sides you can't find anywhere other than the tube"
Amazing app. Love the design and sound quality. Premium is 100% worth it.
"I love the Spotify has Personal he designed playlist, That it releases weekly helps me find good new music, it's a great app"
Good functions well designed
This is the best song recommendation app. Also you can listen to podcasts which are very well designed.
"Perfect -- extremely well designed, seamless across all my devices, fast/responsive, simple interface. Kudos to the development team and UI designers."
I've been listening to music with Spotify for well over a decade. It's been really cool watching it grow into the app I now know and love. It's super helpful that I can search for songs by lyrics and song recognization. I do wish the player would automatically show up in my push notifications like it used to on my old phone but I think that's more of a design flaw in my new device's software.
Personalization is their Forte love having Playlists designed just for me!!! DAILY
"So far, so good. Good design collection as well!"
"Everything is really good. easy to use, good design, big community and song collection. Hope for better sound quality. And maybe some social features, could really raise the time spent on app. More widgets please."
Great service! And a pretty crisp design
Simple and easy to use design. Grrat for looking up new songs. Especially for when i need that hype somg for new PR attempts inthe gym. Plus podcasts. Its good.
If you love and even NEED to have music on your phone then you NEED this app. Cannot say enough good things about these guys and their well designed app.
"Well designed app, great music and podcasts. I appreciate how well it is put together!"
"Best music app, i have ever use. I really loved the design and specially that almost every song has a lyrics. The fun thing is that it helps of make playlist share with friends and families and it also has a option to keep it private. I love this app"
"I use Spotify Premium, and it's great value for money. Spotify has a diverse range of curated playlists, making it easy for you to find the musical genres that you enjoy. It's also clever enough to make playlists designed just for you, based on what you typically listen to. It has never been easier for me to discover new artists and songs that I love!"
Exceptional experience. Well designed. Great collection of music. Couldn't ask for better.
The latest album art updated design with curved edges is horrifying. Pointed edges looked amazing and flat. Pls roll back.
Spotify is the best music and podcast platform web design is easy to use and no hassle payment at a reasonable cost. Keep up the Awesome work!!!üëçüòäüòä
"Free or Premium, definetly the best music app provinser, with a simple and mest design"
Affordable and has every playlist I searched for. The only set back is I can't put a timer so the music can stop playing after a designated time.
"My stress reliever, my addiction, to be honest this is my true love, at the end I'll be like "" it started in 2019 and Now it's 2050 am 45. And my love is yet not gone for you (spotify) "" üòÇüòÇ The way App is designed is comfortable for me to access the color gives me some kind of warm feel and lot more good things to state ,my only problem is ads"
Simply a very well designed app for tune gurus!
I'm new to Spotify and only just became a premium member so I'm still going off of my three month trial but already looking forward to my first payment. Everything I have heard about Spotify is true ! The designers and creators of this app know their stuff and must love music themselves. Cheers to the designers of Spotify I am a very happy Spotify customer and definitely won't be cancelling my sevice for a very long time if at all. Thanks to the team for creating one of the best music apps ever!
My favorite music app by far. One of the very few subscriptions that I enjoy paying. I've literally convinced my whole household of it's glory. Spotify's interface is probably one of the most intelligent designs I've had the pleasure to toggle with. I love you Spotify. I truly do. I use this app all day long and all night. It is the digital Adderall to my all to real ADHD.
My absolute favorite app and most used app that's worth every penny for the membership cost! I use Spotify every single day and love how it recommends and creates mixes of songs designed just for you. My favorite feature that came through a couple updates back shows the song lyrics if you click on them while it's playing and I'm so grateful for this feature!! Love Spotify and will be a lifelong customer!
Just an fantastically designed app. Really well done.
"Excellent music app, the new design finally works flawlessly and am having 0 problems with it. Thank you!"
"I love this app. It gives great music and I love that you can see some playlist others design. And the fact that you can find more music like the music you like. Also, I can exit the app while listening and that's what makes me appeciate this app. Also the ads are a good amount reasonable and also there are plans without ads.üòÖ‚úåÔ∏èüèæ"
"Spotify is the best app ever! It made me thankful for living in this era of time. I really love how the algorithm knows which genre and mood to choose for me based on only one song I search for! I love the Daily Mixes and the recommendations, the huge number of playlists and categories, the design and user experience, and a lot more features. Thank you for this"
"I've been using premium for 2 years now, and right now the app is better than ever. All the compact design, easy to navigate functions, I just love to use Spotify."
Great app for music. Love the design and layout. Highly recommend!
"Need a little development like the app is so boring and if you want some advice on the design Contact me I will do it for for 10$ and if you implement it I want 1500$, deal? Is fun you know."
The music options are pretty much endless when it comes to Spotify. It is only $10 a month for unlimited streaming but the free version is also nice. I love the design and the overall look of the app. It is simple and easy to manage my playlists and podcasts as well.
"Spotify finally listened and added swipe to queue on Android. Finally! I'm not the biggest fan of how it looks, I preferred the slightly blocky design, but the fact that swipe to queue is now a thing makes it all good."
"cool app. nice design. but dont take smth from Apple music, they suck ;)"
Audio randomly cuts off and doesn't continue once the screen switches off - poor design.
"Wow gr8, Just please make very interactive UI design for Spotify"
"Music recommendations algorithm - 10/10 UI needs some work- An example: can't swipe down to bring down the 'Now playing screen' and reaching for the top most times be stressful. Another: The status bar isn't transparent, makes the whole app look weird, like it was designed poorly But in general- Really really good"
"This is a rewrite and reaffirmation of the quality of this application; if you're a music lover, then Spotify is for you. This app was designed for music first and foremost, and premium subscribers (like myself) have gotten many years of good times via music through its interface and discover weekly (without the ads that hamper the free users experience). The most recent controversy trying to take down Spotify is unconvincing for me; this is not a platform, but THE platform for music/podcasts.‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Some UX and design decisions bother me, but it is still my go-to music listening solution. Edit: After years and years of waiting, they added the swipe to queue gesture iPhones had for ages. Finally. :)"
"Listen to your music will a full on emersive experience, they create specific playlists for you, where you can descover new music, or you can create your own playlists and have them designed how you like, Spotify is the best place to get your music and it is loved by so many."
"Amazing app, its smooth and user friendly i love the design and tools"
Spotify app is so beautifully designed offering a lot of choices and it literally knows what you like. üëåüëå‚úå‚úåüíØ
If you are searching for an music app Must try it . I love this application. Its design and search pool is amazing You will love it's working style .go and must try onceüëçüòÄ
I give this a 5 star because the app is designed well for Teens and adults. I really don't mine the ads on this app. My favorite part about this app is it has a setting for Explicit content. It shows E so I know if itis going to say bad stuff. I really injoy that because I don't like bad stuff. Also thay have clean versions of songs that I love. Thanks
"All good , especially the variety designed for me"
"Got a minor bug: In the ""liked songs menu"" you can filter the songs based on the genre. I use the aforementioned menu to get new music to add to a designated playlist later. The issue is if you filter it to a genre, then un-like the all the songs in that filter you can't select a different filter even if you take spotify out of your running apps and run it again. The only way to fix it is to add a song of the ""filter genre"""
"I have spotify premium and I can completely recommend it. The algorithm is very good I discovered so many artists and songs thanks to him. The design is simple and pretty, the app has a lot of features and is very intuitive to use. I never had any technical problems either."
"Awesome app the most stable, well designed reliable music app"
"Spotify is refreshing. Edit: 2 years later, I'm still loving it. Great app and UI. Kudos to the engineering and product design team."
"This app continues to improve and premium is absolutely worth it. You can even play your own audio files. Problems get fixed, you can see your recents, UI is great, design is nice. Wrapped is always a highlight and you can mix yours with someone else. I love using it with maps too! Lyrics had been missing for years, im glad they're back! Problems rn: I might prefer if lyrics scrolled smoothly without the rapid change to the next line. I would also love to see which songs belong to which genres."
"The best music application, i have premium with my family and its amazing, the new udpate with the lyrics is so good!! We have access to any music even unreleased and the app design is wonderful"
"Very nice.....I love the app, tha app is cool in design and shows new playlist everyday And of the singers which we listen the most üëçüòç"
"well designed app, easy to use, hoping to see more good features in the future. well done devs!"
"I love driving and Spotify. Singing while going on road trip is life altering. And Spotify has favorites, liked song list, and music scrapped together for driving, or gaming, or exercising at gym. Even meditative sounding audio play. I truly enjoy Spotify the best from other site designers others the the tubers and all source's - Spotify is champ of musical reach. Thank you Spotify teams and people. Happy New Year's"
App is really well designed and intuitive. Music and podcasts sound fantastic. Brilliant experience all around.
"My go to Music app. Love the design, love the music, love the blend feature. Absolute fav!"
Thank you for being ethical and considerate of your users. I like the app coz the commercials are noninvasive like YouTube. Plus the interface is nicely designed and suggestions are very relevant. Highly recommended üëç Keep up the good job
"Have had Spotify for a good few months now, it's alot less problematic and far less prone to breakdowns to the main competition, (the biggest river in Brazil!,) Infact there's no comparing the two. Spotify is a country mile ahead in every respect. Spotify is the yardstick by which others must be measured, all of whom have a good way to go. Spotify is a great app with clever intuitive features to explore ones own music genre's, very well thought out, and very nicely designed."
"Surpassed my expectations in many ways than one. Well designed, access to millions of songs just at a click of a button indeed, life has never been so joyous with your rhythms."
Definitely the best streaming service for music. Lots of quality of life features like Spotify Connect and Wrapped. The new addition of lyrics for every song is also very helpful. The app itself is very clean and well designed with no bugs even on the Galaxy Z Fold 3. Take my money!
Thank you for designing this app.My day doesn't end without this app. I like how the app suggets next songs based on Junro of the songs we listen. Amazing new features at the end of year!!
"Great experience with spotify for over a yaer now, and the main thing is its mighty algorithms that always know what you want and when you want. I find ""discover weekly"" very accurate, it almost always gives me what i want, and so i always have something new to listen. The price for premium accaunt in my region is very reasonable and i appreciate that. App has also a solid design."
"I love the design and features of Spotify, the way it allows you to view your friend's activity and how they categories profile, artist, album, and etc. It just saved alot of our time. ALWAYS SPOTIFY"
Incredible app !!! The design allows such freedom and variety ! I love the shuffle feature on playing favorites !
"I've had positive experience with the app, I like the simplicity and overall design, recommendations are really tailored to my listening habits and provide me with great options. The app recently introduced the option to show lyrics of the song playing, so I like it even better. Up until now, I've only experienced an app crash once - the app didn't want to load after multiple attemtps to restart it and I was getting an error message saying that there was no internet connection."
"HQ music, nice design, correct prices. Easy to use. Isn't it possible to end music with constantly decreasing volume at the end of the sleep timer? :)"
I use to be a big Pandora fan til a couple years ago. Started using Spotify and haven't touched Pandora again. The app is well designed and fast. Has to s of podcasts too.
I love Spotify because it has the most music selections and the best overall platform design.
"Spotify has the best intuitive interface, a fantastic recommendation engine powering its customized playlists, new features added all the time, social tools that make sharing easy, plus you can use it almost anywhere through almost any device. I really like what you have done with the design recently giving it more of a Fluid Look so Keep it Up ‚úåüèª."
"Spotify is just ""effin"" DOPE!! Super user-friendly, almost any and every single song...of every single genre, and the overall design and look of Spotify is extremely attractive! Job well done Spotify üíØüí™üèΩüî•üî•"
"Well, the overall design of Spotify is impressive. Spotify is my new Music Vault. I do like Pandora, however I've noticed when playing my toddler music (age appropriate), adult rated music will sneak in - yes I said, ""sneak in"" as in sneaky - almost purposely introducing toddler innocent minds to *adult rated music* inappropriate and unappreciated. No Good* - please ""Spotify"" filter your playlist/channels delicately, bc mom's like me, I'm not having it! - ü§ó"
"Being a developer myself, I admire the UI design of this application. It's minimalistic design with right colour combinations and strong algorithms used to recommend similar songs are remarkable. These are enough points to make me use this stunning app."
"Great experience! the art, the music, the design and the access being the perfect piece to a high and deep adventure of listen and feel Spotify like a Marterpiece. Successful listen process to everybody."
"Large variety of music. Because of the large number of songs available, it will be great if it could smoothly transition to the next song after a designated duration (2' or 3')."
By far the best designed music streaming app out there! My favourite feature is the ability to use my phone as a remote while I listen on other devices. I highly recommend Spotify.
"The whole design of the app is really cool for me,the music i want is easy to find and i descover new content every time i open it...so good job"
This application is designed greatly and it's too nice. The cool thing about this application is there is almost no annoying ads and that's why I love this. I faced only a problem when I put a playlist in Google's Alarm application it's not working . I don't know whose is creating problem Spotify or Google's Alarm app. Please solve it.
Thank you so much for this excellent app. This app is so carefully designed for all music lovers. I am enjoying it even when the network is slow that too free. I sometimes feel guilty that I am enjoying all these goodies without spending a penny. But don't worry I will upgrade my membership to premium one of this days.
"Loved the experience of playing music on Spotify. Their subscription is also such that it does not burn a hole in your pocket. Also they do not reduce the quality of music just because we are not subscribed to them. Their ads are also designed really well, it's quite fair when they say 'watch this short video and get the next 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening'."
Good service if you want to stream music on any device. App is well designed.
"A world of sound!!!!! Endless variety of music, stories, podcasts and entertainment all through a classy provider. An audible compact design, and all at ears reach!!!! Its money well spent for the audiophile."
This is a well made app for music it let's you design your own playlists and makes playlist based on what you listen to all in all this is a great app for music even if you dont have premium
Finding music that caters to your style has never been more easier to find. Great app design and interface coupled with plenty of in depth configuration settings makes Spotify probably the best music app you can find.
"I have been using Apple Music, Deezer and Yandex.Music before. And Spotify is the best music app for me! It works perfect, has the biggest library of the music and has the greatest design. The multi-device sync is crazy, cause I can control music playing on one device using another and I use often So I highly recommend it for you)"
I am a Wynk user. Downloaded Spotify and found the music quality is awesome and UI design is great. Lakhs of songs. Became a premier member now. Uninstalled Wynk.
The ease of using the app makes its user experience to be at a satisfying optimum level. Such a great app based on its interface design.
"A great app for mucic lovers but the only small dislike of these app is about the most ads.As for every two to three songs there is an ad and even the ads have skip option but the design,performance, playlists,songs collection are awesome."
"Honestly I thought paid streaming platforms were a scam since you can download songs and podcasts offline. Turns out I'm wrong! Spotify makes life easier with it's (Clean design, High quality songs and podcasts, Easy to use program, Great recommendations) and much more! Spotify is just perfect the way it is, I don't think anything could be further improved. It's just perfect! Edit: I'm using Spotify premium, The free version is a little bit annoying with the ads and skip limits."
"I've always been looking forward to using Spotify, sadly, the service wasn't available in Malawi since it started until 2021. I enjoy the app experience, meticulously designed and I love the music recommendations. Collaboration works great on play lists and I found it useful during a recent road trip. One annoying aspect is that it is hard to manage my music library, unlike Apple Music. Searching for friends is always a hit and miss situation, usually a miss for me. Hope they improve that."
Very happy with this app. I am a Google Music Refugee and Spotify is Light Years better than the replacement YouTube Music. The playlists created for me are very good in comparison to anything from them. App controls are intuitive and simple. Great design and performance
"Excellent song recommendations every week at least better than every other music app out there, plus awesome audio quality. Been using this app since 4years now no issues, love their UI design too."
Very to easy to use and navigate on. Got some really good music. Looks a very good and well designed app. Very pleased with it.
"Nice and simple app. I really love the design, but, some there's some music i can't play even if i have a premium membership, like some nightcores/record.. I hope you can update it so i can listen the nightcore version too. Oh and i really love how the audio is delivered it's soft to my ear :3"
"Brilliant app, with a classy, hip design and very user friendly. Love the algorithm it uses to generate personal playlists! Makes listening to music simple, fun and exciting!"
"Practically the best music app, besides the usual features it has one of the best recommendation system, truly captures your playlist mood. PROS: - great design. - great user experience. - music recommendations. - full set of features with premium. - a really good API if you're a developer. CONS: - crashes on desktop macbook (tolerable though since it's not too frequent) - friends music activity can be a little glitchy. (if you're interested in friends activity)"
"The app that is full of memories with vijay uncle as I am his nephew, and many songs available with out premium also I recommend many of my friends to use Spotify very glad to have Spotify on my phone thank you Spotify team for designing a wonderful app of songs to the world."
"Compliments other music apps for a great experience if you're a die hard music lover, like me. Spotify is well designed, by music fans for music fans."
Streamlined design and a vast catalog make this the best choice for streaming music. Period. Kudos to the devs for providing an intuitive platform with access to music from all era or area.
"This is what a music app should be, I am a free user but It doesn't disturb you much while playing your songs, It gives 1 ad in 30 min and that also is designed so well that it doesn't disturb my peace of mind Pros: 1. Ads are really very very less than jiosaavn 2.They do not repeat the same ads continuously (they always try to change the taste) 3.Vast network of all kinds of music 4.There are no forced ads that will definitely direct you to that product's website Cons: 1. No cons for me"
"Long time listener. I like rather minimalistic design of the app, flexible payment options and... algorithms! Thanks to Spotify I've discovered so many great artist!"
"I am loving this platform of spotify..The theme , design etc,. Everything is perfect.. But only some of the songs does not have lyrics ....but overall i love spotify... We are here to support you spotify... Keep going on and bring some special changes in spotify.. Thank you...üòáüòä"
"So first of all the UI of spotify is just great. Smartphone, as well as the PC app have a great design and are very intuitive. I have every song I want and the music quality of Spotify is the best of all music streaming services. I listen to spotify on the highest quality with high quality headphones, because the best sound is very important to me. Spotify can provide that. If you don't want to spend money in the beginning that's fine. I think even the Basic version of Spotify is really great."
Such a user friendly app. Also a wide variety of music with individually designed playlists. A wonderful experience!
"Spotify is the Best app ever! I use this app alot and Ive never had any issues with it. I've created several playlists, and Spotify has created several playlists, designed especially for me, with hundreds of songs that I ‚ô•Ô∏è, all for free! Thank you Spotify! I recommend you check it out, You cant go wrong with this app!"
This app never let's you down with all it's new music and always trying to give you the best experience whether its checking up on you to see if you are enjoying the app or finding better deals for you or even upgrading you package to suit you. Spotify always has new music specifically designed for you taste in music and your favourite genre!!
"Love it ,you can design your own Playlist. And they will suggest/make you a weekly Playlist based on things you've listened to. And being able to listen while scrolling facebook or kohls/walmarts app is pretty cool !!"
App is designed beautifully. Content is good. Playlists are awesome. Sound quality is awesome. Only content of old Bollywood songs is less. So need improvement for this topic. Overall nice experience.
"I really liked the way, the designers have designed the app. Playing songs on this app was really a great feeling. I have used other apps for listening to songs which includes Gaana, Hungama Music, Airtel Wynk. Still I would say that this the best music listening app I have seen so far. Thank you makerss. The only thing I want improved is that you must add a section where I could play the songs which are in the phone memory, even if I am offline. Else, I loved it."

"Great choice of music in any language, app well designed and easy to use"
"Great app, really good design, and I listen to songs everyday. I wish that some premium features were free. There is a really cool free feature where you get lyrics and background information on the artist and song."
The perfect app for music streaming. Literally. The audio quality is amazing period. And you can control the audio quality too. Love the simplistic design and layout.
Love the app. It's design is asthetically pleasing to me and the radio function to find new songs is really helpful. Definitely worth the price to me.
"Well designed app, but make sure you're always on the latest version, otherwise it tends to get pretty buggy."
I enjoy the design of the app and the personalized music playlists that are spot on exactly what I'm looking for.
"Best music service there is. The app design is beautiful and easy to use. The algorithm learns fast and adjusts to your tastes. I love the Discover Weekly Playlist feature. There's even a timer to stop the music if you fall asleep. It's obvious that it's made from people who ""get"" music."
"Such a great app! Simple yet elegant UI and design. Good song quality even for free access. Just a few glitches and bugs from time to time. But, I also hope they'd improve the song suggestions for Daily Mixes and Weekly playlists. Overall, I highly recommend the app!"
"I love every part of Spotify: the design, the endless playlists and the podcasts. I spend a lot of my day with Spotify running in the background. It's just that good"
"The design,colours of an app is very impressive its advertisement sounds similar to a radio ads Music quality is far better then other platforms"
"The song selection is incredible, it's format design is incredibly easy to understand and use, even for someone who threatens to kill their phone every 5 Seconds because I touched the side of the screen üòÖ I've had Spotify for a few years now and I've cultivated a pretty nice library and I've really enjoyed it, I've actually been using my sisters however, I definitely plan I'm getting it for myself in the future! It has been something I've appreciated, during Covid-19 especially."
Very good carefully designed if ads were less frequent on the free version it would be so much better but still top notch for me at least
The UI/UX of Spotify is so so so good. Each version comes with marvelous design updates. The colours on the latest version is so balanced for the notification player. It just feels perfect and also it changes and fits according to the Song cover photo. Thank you so much Spotify team!!! You're an inspiration üòò
"awesome app, has every song i want and more!! and all my favorite podcast, annually crime junkies!!! the g.o.a.t. out all podcast. love the daily mix designed especially for your profile and couldn't ask for more. not a crazy amount of ads and premium enhances to experience to New levels."
This is really an awesome experince at whole another level with the live lyrics. The app design is too good. One of the that i dont appreciate about this app is too many adds....
"Great app for music. Nice design and great automatic personal playlists. Recommend trying out the pre-made 'mood' specific playlists, as these contain some fine hand picked tunes (you basically pay the music experts that make these if you have a subsctiption) that usually perfectly fits the description. Have never not found stuff I was looking for, as their music library contains basically all new music and a decent array of older albums as well."
"I've used nearly all major streaming services, I feel spotify fits best for my use amongst the others. I enjoy the UI theme and design, and the way it integrates with other devices. I've discovered more artists I've become appreciative of thanks to Spotify. I can honestly say i can't imagine my life without music, and Spotify provides me with more than exceptional service and ease of use. A solid 5 stars."
"Incredible! Able to build & edit my own playlists. Best indie & underground labels, hands down. Best catalogues. Excellent design & functionality! Affordable subscription service!"
This is my go-to app for all music now. Best part I love about them is podcasts. I just love listening to them. It has very easy interface and good design.. 30sec ad in free version is the only problem. Which I think is fair enough for free version
Makes listening to music easy and convenient. Great app design and a great community.
"I LOVE SPOTIFY, my favorite part is they make weekly playlists designed for ME!!! And they get it right 100% of the time."
"Best app for music. I live in Russia and only now we can use Spotify, finally! So good quality, no bugs, awesome design, works even with terrible connection in good quality."
"Undoubtedly the best streaming service here in India. I've tried all the major ones over the past few years, switching between apps countless times. Finally when Spotify resolved all the issues in Indian version, there's no going back. It has wider library esp for English, best app design, and far better music recommendation than any other services out there."
"The best music streaming service on the market. Definitely would recommend, also the prices in USD are reasonable, but I live in Russia and if talking about IT'S prices, they're SO low (In a good way!) that they just make Spotify a good deal when choosing between what's already available in here, crushing alternatives into dust. The overall quality of music is awesome, when you have premium, design of the app (both desktop and mobile) are giving ONLY what YOU need. 5 Stars - it is."
"Overall a very good experience and music quality, and at this point I think I'm not cancelling my subscription anytime soon. One suggestion, though: please get rid of as many of the sharp corners from the user interface as you can. The design looks outdated, it would look a lot ""newer"" with more rounded corners."
"I like this app, I like it's simplicity and design, vast collection of songs, still has lot of collection to be added of the past, never the less. I appreciate the effort of this app"
"I love the new design. The premium version is a 10/10. Also the music recommendations are always on point and so are the playlists made by them. The shuffle option could be a lot better, since right now it always plays the same songs. There are a lot of songs that are not available for certain regions, but sadly that's not something Spotify can do a lot about."
"I really really like the app , the way it's been designed and it's very easy to use and find music , it's so cool and give us a good experience of the music"
"This is a great app! It is clear and easy to use and is very intuitive, it allows me to stream my music, what I want, when I want, all in all, a high quality, well designed app."
No words but could say that it is a lakh times better than gaana the design of the app is very simple and attractive and also it provides a good quality music and each and every song can be avalible on this app which made me force myself to install itüòäwonderful app!!
Best app I have ever seen ...... I 100% assure that all negatives are the problem of their phone not the app It's just woww ....so smoothly and user friendly design and software ...amazing
Amazing UI as well as app design and useability. Reccomend more variety to newer artists that have the potential to get very famous. Have someone dig around on SoundCloud until they find a pure talent. Overall 5 stars. 10/10
"One of the best apps to listen music, podcasts. Everything is made in perfect way: design, sharing, excellent radio mode. Just comfortable and understandable interface to use!"
"Spotify has and always will be my number one app for music streaming. Spotify's great UI design makes the use of the app so streamlined and easy. New features are constantly being added to improve upon this further. Also, it's use of personalised playlist is unrivaled. It will consistently suggest songs from big named artists you may be sleeping on to underground artists on the rise. I swear this app knows my music taste better than I do"
This app has huge collection of songs. Also the sound quality is very good . Spotify is one of the most well designed apps out there. It's beautiful and a joy to use. I Love it. ‚ù£Ô∏è
"Great way to listen to music and podcasts. I appreciate that the main page is designed to keep track of the type of music and podcasts I enjoy listening to, and similar options. Thank you for the great service."
"Excellent app, in every way. Searches and song loading are fast, app is well-designed and bug-free. I love the tight in-app integration with many other platforms, like Sonos, as well as Google Assistant."
"An amazing app in features, design and music content. As an EDM fan, Spotify is paradise."
"Spotify is one of the most well designed apps out there. It's beautiful and a joy to use. I don't like having separate apps for my music and podcast needs and Spotify has them both! Although the free plan has been serving me well so far (at least you don't get interrupted between a podcast), I can totally understand why someone would happily pay for such a delightful user experience."
Love Spotify! I have tried lots of streaming services but Spotify has the edge. Slick interface and its algorithms and design make new music discovery effortless.
I used all the available apps on playstore. Spotify is one of best i found. Its very well designed to get you kind of music you want to listen.
The only app I use for music. They actually have Playlists designed just for you that are made daily. I love this app better than Pandora and if you have Spotify Premium then you get Hulu for free.. You can't beat that deal!
"Better in almost every way! Congrats to Spotify for improving on most of its complaints and listening to its customers. Lyrics are back and now on mobile!! Genius is mostly gone (I think) and replaced with 'Storyline', a welcome change. That, combined with ease of use, podcasts, increasingly better playlists and suggestions are distancing Spotify from its competitors. I still think the 'new' Home page could be polished and made smarter, more useful, better designed (it's a bad Tidal ripoff)."
I've been using the free version of this app.... I swear it has a really fun experience also the way this app is designed is just flawless.... Sound quality is adjustable but really good... And it consumes very less amount of data which is fantastic.....
Spotify is The best I only use Spotify and YouTube personally I always love the design and how it is so smooth to find what u want to listen to and the variety of music is awesome because Spotify gives a lot of smaller artist love that other online music streaming services don't.
"Overall a very good app with an intuitive design but I think that it could be some what faster on my Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus Exynos 9810. I also think that you should redesign the widget and make us be able to make it smaller or bigger. I believe you should add functions to it as repeat and shuffle and also make it have rounded corners. Well as I said, This app is awesome"
"Fell in love with app and thier devs. Really interesting to see how effectively they designed and developed. Reching all corners, seems the perfect example of digital transformation !! Suggestions to add features like - spotify music stories/news/releases , so that users can follow/read - even though premium is there, put albums/songs for sale for less price. So that users can buy and listen forever in your app. - music learning courses (live, if possible) free/payable from popular gurus."
"The app not only has your favorite music, but even makes you find and explore new music!! The design of this app is incredible too!! I've loved the app from the beginning"
"Spotify is just the coolest thing ever! There are plenty of entertainment options, the design is visually and mechanically impeccable, the sound quality is superb, and the sharing features are amazing! I have loved Spotify for many years! Spotify is a paragon of music apps and one of the absolute best entertainment apps available. Two thumbs up! Definitely... DEFINITELY bruh..."
"Amazing ! Thank you for the developer, youre creative. ÂêéÊù•ÊâçÁü•ÈÅìËøõÂà∞ÁΩëÁªúÂú®„Äê·∏û·∏ê·∏ê9.·∏àO·πÇ„ÄëÁöÑÁΩëÈ°µ‰ΩìÈ™åËµÑÊ∫êÊó†Â∞ΩÁöÑÁâàÊú¨ÈÇ£ÈáåÈù¢ËÉΩÁé©Âà∞ËøôÊ∏∏ÊàèÁöÑÊó†ÈôêÊ∏∏ÊàèÂ∏ÅÁâàÊú¨ËÆ©‰Ω†ÊãøÂà∞ÊâãËΩØSuccess will happen for you all, amen,Started playing when it came out to this, ive been playing it very much lately and i will keep playing it.This game has a lot of different levels for us to play and all of them are fun too. The pictures and the ways that they design the game are brilliant, especially the levels that require you to interact with things before you can find what you need. Hope that there will be more updates soon and I am really looking forward for the new levels!"
"I love Spotify. I enjoy how personalized it is. I think the time capsules and yearly rewinds are really good. Also, the interface itself is very well designed."
"This is simply the best app for streaming music all over the world! Simple to use, many features, cool design and nice download and storage technology for offline songs and Playlists! And the Abo price is really acceptable üòä So 10/10 recommended!"
"Other than the live music share feature needing more functionality, this app is amazing with a great range of music and podcasts with a simple design."
"Just got worse, first of all let me say that I loved the old player design so much, apart from being subjective there are some major button swapping/relocation which I believe breaks the habit of users, menu button is now on top which I personally used a lot and which is now hard to reach also it does not feel premium now, feels dibalanced. I hope this review is helpful for spotify and they do something about it."
"All around great app. Well designed, fairly intuitive. Works well for online/offline playing, casting to speakers or smart tvs etc. Broadest selection of music in one place that you can find across any and all genres."
I enjoy how this music flows over me. I'd like the user interface design. Especially I like about the marketing strategy that always reminds user to switch to premium. I hope there's a better development day by day.
I can't say enough about Spotify. It is truly the best service out there. From playlist to music design specially for you. Spotify is the best!
"The classic design,and music output attracts me a lot ‚ô•Ô∏è,even few songs are not available!"
"The model of the app and the design of the app is awesome and user-friendly. A ""must have"" app for music listeners."
"I have never had such an extensive repetoire of music immediately available to me and I will not even go into the smoothness of the layout and interface. The design is elegant and intuitive, there is very little Spotify could do to ruin this experience but I'll not tempt you."
Very well designed app with automated play list generation that detects and mimics your music choice. 10/10
Most beautifully designed app ... A lot of Variety never heard of .. lot of variation . HUGE collection for everyone's choice Best Music listing app . Yes better than gaana or savan or hungama It is the best .. Very sweet UI
"Best music app out there; gives the best suggestions for similar songs in a playlist, smooth user interface, and awesome design overall. Highly recommend for all music lovers."
"Great app! I enjoy listening to music whatever, whenever, wherever I want! specially if you will avail premium account, it's worth what you pay even if its only for 3 months for only 150 pesos. I will definitely avail again the premium account once it ends up. Highly recommended app. I enjoy my work as a home based graphic designer while listening to Spotify with my favorite songs that I want to play. name it and it is all available in a search engine if you avail premium account. thumbs-up!"
"Many thanks to have this app for free, it is a truly awesome app especially for finding new music to listen to. However I found a big mistake: I can't or it is very non-intuitive to play a specific song without adding it to a playlist with other songs similar with it, which is really annoying especially because it is just a design flaw, and easy to fix."
The app is great and comes with great genres of music .The daily mix feature is also great and fabulous.The app design seems to have much materialistic design which is great and the detailings in the app doesn't look puny.
I want to play only my songs in my playlist don't need suggestions by my playlist maybe a new look these things fixed be nice more features more widgets maybe a different design needs more updates please more features major updates please add more widgets
"Best music app I have spent money on because of no ads, unlimited creation of playlist, offline downloads UX design and the special animations (that seem to be only on Spotify) that play on screen when you're listening."
"I subscribed immediately! The best collection of music I love, beautiful mixes and playlists personaly designed based on my choice, clear sound - perfectly balanced for each song. Love it more than any other music app. Thank you for creating such app and filling my day with music‚ù§ Love this app more every day - all the music which I love, all music which I shall listen. Thank you Spotify Team for rising love vibesüòç"
Great music and easy interface. I love the modern design and color scheme just upgraded to premium and it is worth every penny!
"I find Spotify very useful and very well designed. I love the features and love all of the Playlists I can make. So overall, it's a good music app in my opinion. 10/10"
"Amazing, user friendly, simplistic design with a complex algorithm to give you the best daily recommendations. Never miss a concert from the updates of you top artists and be the first to hear new tracks."
"Best music app service to date, could do with more frequent updating of personalised algorithm based playlists with more regularity. Otherwise, well designed with many settings features."
"I love the design, music selection, and I always recommend people to get the premium."
Happy with music and streaming quality as well as the recommendations of music designed to fit your taste. Definitely worth it!
Really good. The Indian version still doesn't have certain songs and artists but overall it makes music on the go very very convenient. And I love the design and UI.
"Add artists and get your custom design yourself. Cant get any better then that really. Unless they add some kinda audio advancement. There is a few audio advance settings like normalize and loud setting. Download in high quality too. That's it tho, customizing your own home base for your music makes up for that."
"This app is just sensational. It has such a great design, easy to deal with, and the premium version offers an offline mode that is perfect for listening to music anywhere at anytime."
"Ok so I might have a different experience since I have a premium subscription but this is just the most convenient, all platform-friendly, and well designed music app."
Makes listening to music simple. The design is nice and sleek. Easy to navigate app and it has a large selection of songs to choose from.
It honestly surpasses all of the other music streaming apps with its easy to use software but also up to date designs and music. And also for a VERY low price!!!
The best music app you'll ever need! The app learns your music taste and generates great music suggestions accordingly. Great user experience and design as well.
"Only music app I listen to & having Premium is well worth it! Love that I can say playlist, create my own playlist and am able to download songs for offline use (tho it does eat up a mega amount of my internal storage - iPhone unfortunately does not offer the hardware that is needed for additional external storage nor are they designed to house such thing....ie - SD cards/micro cards/etc....so Apple get with the program please!!!!) So it would be nice if the songs didn't eat up so much storage!"
"The app rarely crash now, thanks to the regular update and bug fixing. The new design is nice and smooth."
I love this app's UI design and all the functions of the application works! I never had a problem with spotify and use this app everyday on my normal commute to work and back home! You host all of my favorite musicians on this platform as well üòç Keep up the great work and shoutout to your software engineers as well for holding it down!
App is amazingky designed easy to find what you want.. cant complain about the selection of music available
"Excellent music selection, app is well designed and has a good user interface"
"When it comes to streaming music and podcasts. This is the best app. Can pretty much find everything I want, and its a clean design."
"The type of app that I've been dreaming of since childhood. Great quality with regards to music, variety and design of the app. Only downside is that it's sometimes laggy on Android system."
"This app is crazy dope, now I'm a graphics designer and work can be stressful, so i need some good tunes to keep my mind at ease. Lofi beats, ASMR, whatever it is that you need, it's there! The Premium version is somewhat worth it."
this app is very well designed as it plays your favorite songs and let's you pic from your favorite song creators I believe many people will love and enjoy this app
"Amazing app, well designed and good presentation, good service and listening qualitie. In my experience, it's probably better than apple music, because of personalization features or maybe of more setting options, also because of the capability of connect this app with all the smart environment. This is just an opinion, if you give a chance to Spotify, you will live a unique experience."
"This app is always overlooked by the general population as being one of the best designed apps around because its now a necessity! It doesnt feel like a third party app, it feels like it was designed with your phone!!!"
"Great music and great design. I like that eventhough I am still a senior high student, I still got the student discount and Im really enjoying it. 5 stars yall"
"Most songs are here. Awesome. If you have any songs you want added, there are tutorials out there that can add songs/audio files from your computer to your personal music library (meaning the addition will be privy to your account). Equalizer is really good. Interface can use a different mode that contrasts the current design for varying preferences. It's pretty tricky too when you try to view the whole library of music of a certain artist. Perhaps improve that as well. Overall, just greatness."
Best music streaming service. Intuitive design and constantly adding new features. Only gripe is I wish there were more swipe gestures on Android like there is on iOS
"Highly recommend app. What an amazing app. Everything is so perfect, can easily play any song. The app has design in such a way that we can easily play any song .Just loved it."
it's a brilliant app for me. The UI design of this app awesome. And so much variety of songs. I really like this App. üëç
"Free version is awful by design, forcing ads and no way to turn off shuffle. But the paid version is absolutely worth it, I use it every day to play my favorite music and find new music and podcasts. Its Spotify. you know what it is."
Back up to 5 stars. Thanks for going back to the previous design and fixing the glitches. Looks and runs smooth again
"Confused by the uptade at first, makes total sense now and improves my listening experience! Great colour design on the lock screen interface!"
"The best music service, with great device support, excellent quality, and a fast, clear app. The designers and development team should be proud."
love the new app design. very well organized and easy to find the songs/podcasts I want to listen to. easy to find new songs too!
"All music exists on this software. For $10/mo you can literally steal the soul of all the great masters of every genre of music from the beginning of recorded music. The 3 major label conglomerates take most of the money, leaving only crumbs for the writers and performers. It's a great way to find the music you love, even make playlists for offline play, but for Christ's sake, if you love an artist, find other ways to support them. Buy some designer vinyl, go to shows..."
"Really clean design, good music quality. And I absolutely LOVE the recommended music Playlist. It changes every monday and curates new music for me so I don't have to search."
I think Spotify premium is really good and you really get what you pay for. There is more music than any other music platforms I've tried and I like the design of the app.
"I'm now happy with the app, but I would redesign the UI to show more content other than music. It's quite hard to find it and it's hilarious that is the case nowadays."
very nicely designed app with consistently updated options. ive never not found a song on spotify but spotify does make money through their premium membership so without that you cant play specific songs on demand
Have been using Spotify for yeaaars now and i still love it like on day 1. Thank you! I did prefer the design before more but its still amazing.
One of the best applications to listen music because of it's simple and cool design.
"Imagine if Apple Music was actually a well designed, functional app. This is that, but without the branding."
"A streaming service like nothing before its time. A revolution in music listening, for good and bad. Artists get worked over initially but get but promotion, and discovery than ever before...fair? Not sure. But it is here to stay and the app looks great and designed well too. Cheers"
Ease of use. Amazing variety including international music. Very well designed.
Spotify has always been great. The interface is so user friendly and it's way superior than other streaming apps designwise and in catalogue.
"the app runs smoothly, the design is simple and looks good. there's a wide selection of songs, and the quality is excellent. i would recommend to buy the premium version, i personally think it is worth the price."
I LOVE my Spotify! The algorithms that pick what music they think I'd like are always spot on and if i could somehow work for this company promoting them I would do it in a heart beat everyday! its a wonderfully designed app and makes my evwryday better by bringing me new and classic tunes to love! Stay amazing Spotify staff!
"Update: thank you for listening to our suggestions, works awesome again. Keep it up! Please do something asap with the resolution of the app's design. For 6.3 inch phones (1080x2340 px) the icon looks awful when opening up and the home screen enlarged and disproportionate. Edit: latest update seems to solve this, great!"
"Simple, beautiful and a clean design which is easy to use. The recommended playlists are top notch, I've founs plenty of new songs and artists to listen to thanks to Spotify."
"Pretty solid with premium, song algorithm is good and it's well designed. No complaints so far."
"Got all the music I ever wanted. Intuitive and beautiful design, look amazing on iPad, iPhone, Android and my apple watch. I can control music simultaneously on multiple devices!"
this is by far the best music streaming app out there. I cant tell you how much I listen to music on this app and the developers did an amazing job designing the app and making it easy to use. thank you guys so much for making such an amazing music platform so I can listen to my music whenever I want.
"I like how there are curated playlists on the app for me, also I like the seamless and easy design of the app. There is a great range of music available from jazz, to meditation relaxing sounds, popular music and so forth, so far so good!"
The best music app! Made me delete all the existing music apps in my phone. Great design and apt recommendations with a very clean UI
"I love the concept of this app, beautiful design. Only lacks a few minor things, bu overall, a usefull and nice app."
"i been using this long time, and this is the best among others.. i like the layout design and the way they present the playlist and recommendations...easy to use .Only frustating to me was some of my favorite artist was no avail..especially the albums of tadao hayashi's FINGERTRIP. and older album of john kaizan neptune was no avail...please have it available..thank you"
Amazing application. The most user friendly music experience. The UI design is the best. Spotify team thanks for launching in India.
"I love Spotify all around. It's a great service and app, which always works and has an intuitive design."
"just awesome n best design ui , recomendation ,sound quality and collection...best in the world. and finally india launch! surely ll be the biggest hit!"
"I love Spotify. The perfect music experience in an app. Excellent interface, great song suggestions based on your listening habits, and all around great design."
Simple and minimalistic design! This music service is easy to use and is worth the monthly subscription! everything works perfectly and i rarely have issues.
Best music app ever designed. Low bandwidth high quality sound... Would be nice to have video on it. Ideal car cars. Better than any radio station
Offers a great selection of music to suite for most people's interests. Very intuitive and beautiful app design. Love it!
"easy to use, great design, awesome music and spectacular for curing boredom. if you get the premium you can download songs and play them offline. overall its a great app. I totally recommend it."
Love it! Easy interface and lovely design. Would recommend to anyone who loves organization and appealing visuals. Very cheap as well.
My favourite app ever. I love that it designs playlists that it thinks you might like and broadens your horizons.
"Most reliable, intelligent designed and easy usable streaming service out there. Premium is worth every penny. As for the android app itself, it uses minimal resources and can be used as a remote for other logged in Spotify instances, supports SD card downloads and is all together very intuitively designed without losing the possibility of detailed configuration and edits to your playlist."
This app is awsome ..iv used dezzer always .and Amazon'.however prefer the old Spotify now my self ..also produce music my self and design sounds and samples so will be hitting Spotify with them real soon lol. Thanks guys for excellent service cheers
"Well designed, fairly minimal unnecessary notifications (ads). Content is good, although the Spotify recommendation engine doesn't seem to be as good as Pandora."
"The content is great, design intuitive, and I love being able to explore so many diverse genres of music."
I have been very pleased with Spotify since I went with their premium package. Before that there were too many ads which I guess served the purpose it was designed for and that is to aggravate me so much it would inspire me to invest in the premium package. Good app.
My most used app. Great design and the discovery playlists are great. Wish lyrics could be done in house but musixmatch is fine for now.
"First time i am actually reviewing. Its convenient, well designed, and completely worth the modest price. No more using youtube for music."
"Great app, recently had some difficulty with it but support@spotify had it sorted in minutes üëç Have come across some great new music thanks to playlists designed based on what I listen to."
"Yo I do love Spotify which is why I'm rating it as a 5, but for some reason theres now an older version of Spotify on this store? You can tell because the logo is using an older, less ""flat"" design and it's missing tons of features. It's kinda funny that some people haven't clocked on it's the wrong version haha. Either way you can get the latest ver on the Amazon store - so don't fret too much people."
"I use spotify constantly. So incredibly well designed and easy to use, 100% recommend to anyone and everyone."
"recommended by a friend, love it! room for improvement : a designated folder for downloaded songs for easy access when no data üòÅ"
"Great music app. Great design, easy to find what you're looking for. We'll priced subscription model. I use Spotify at home, at work for music and during my commute for podcasts that I can listen to offline."
"Great app, great design, easy to use, awesome deals for students. Only thing is that the app will crash occasionally on my Samsung Galaxy S8- I'm not the only one with this issue so it seems like it is unique to the S8"
"As a digital designer, you can feel the passion and effort going into this app. It is definitely created for the user experience. They are my favourite music app and they probably always will be if they keep existing."
Easily my favorite music app. The playlists specifically designed to users musical preferences are my favorite part. Fridays and Mondays are my favorite days of the week thanks to Spotify!
