review_description
"Generally a good service, but! I'm a traveler and digital nomad so I change my location quite often and in order to continue using Spotify I have to change my country in the settings if my account. Can't we make it automatically? It's quite outdated to bind people to an adress. While I can understand that there might be payment/currency issues, but even on the free version it's happening as well."
"Most bugs and requests I have reported to Spotify have been fixed and developed. This is how developers should react to feedback. One bug though remains: A downloading notification for Spotify playlists, remains (when playlist is automatically renewed) even if the download is over and the only way to get rid of it is to tap on it thus opening the app. Then it immediately goes away. Ps. How about a new UI theme choice? :!-)"
"There are other apps too stop pretending like you're the only one out there spotify. Even if that doesn't work I can just pirate music. Other than you insisting that ""you shall bear with the ads or perish"" your service is actually pretty good, both sound quality and ui wise very pog."
"I love this app. I love how it chooses just the right song based on my activy, unlike with other apps that chooses a way different genre of a song I'm playing which sucks. But I hope there could be a button or a feature wherein we don't have to swipe up for the lyrics every single time, just something that would show the lyrics automatically for all songs we're playing. If you get the idea? I'll be looking forward for it."
There should be an option to download individual songs. Could also use an even a quicker way of adding a song to a playlist.
unpopular opinion but i actually like the newer player ui. nicely done spotify team. Try to make it a little less cluttered and your app will be even better
"Hello, Spotify team, Gives a clear button for recent played Because person to person they changes their mind for listening songs and that's annoying for hearing same songs in different mood or mindset of same person. So pleased, suggest this upgrade to your team leader, Thank you."
"Good app, love the experience. One small bug I found: During a Remote Group Session, only Iphone users can see the song queue. For android users the button is greyed out. Would love to see this fixed."
"It's great love this app, I wish a lot of songs were on here. Songs that are from SoundCloud and etc. One problem is when I skip through multiple songs quickly sometimes it'll freeze and etc"
Good app with a lot of music to suit different music taste.
Excellent app. I am able to listen all my old songs. I can add songs from one album to another album very easily. Not giving 5 star rating because I can't add few songs in my album all together. That one improvement is required.
"It gets the job done. I can listen to my own, familiar music, or search a radio according to how I feel. Family plan works for everyone and the offline listening when there's no internet connection is fantastic for those power outage times. Gives me something to kick back to as long as I've thought ahead to download some stuff. UI can be better, but it's not the worst I've used either."
"This app works really well, would like the non-premium to have more skips though. Otherwise great all round app. Awesome for listening to good playlists and sharing music with friends. Very simple UX and UI which i really appreciate."
"I enjoy Spotify and without it my life would be quite different, however it doesn't have some old or social media songs"
The thing I love the most is the discoverability and versatilities of genres. And definitely the overall UI and the always dark theme.
"When it has to load (which is a moderate amount) it takes a while, or it just stops and you have to press the play button on whatever your listening to (exept for podcasts). Also usually when it plays an ad that should give you ""thirty minutes of ad free music"" it just plays a song or two then gives you more ads. (Free user pov) Edit: i now have premium and 4 the past few months its been where it just stops in the middle if the song and then just starts up again or it takes like 10 min to load:("
Guys there is many bugs in miui version plz fix itüò£ because I use Spotify everytime I can't live without music üòçplz fix the bugs üò•
Spotify is great would be 5 starts if the enhance button didn't appear and then disappear
"It's a great app, but ive just found a little bug on my Redmi 7 at least. So, when i try to put a song from the beggining using the minute/second bar, it just gets stuck on a certain minute/second but the song keeps playing on the background, idk why, but then it gets fixed by using the button of restart song. Id give 5 stars tbh."
"I love the Spotify app, Ive been a premium user for years. I would LOVE to see a feature added where if you have a playlist/album downloaded thru premium, that it would default to playing the downloaded version rather than using data. When my cell service is spotty, my music wont load. When I toggle airplane mode quick, it loads instantly. Can this be fixed? Thanks!"
Overall great! Downloaded music stops at random and will not start to play again until 'play' button is pressed.
It lacked count-down timer for shutdown. A key feature required at bed time. Thank you Spotify for adding the function.
"Somewhat better now, the ads have lessened to some degree afaik, and the songs that I'd otherwise not want to listen to are actually quite good in terms of the overall selection of songs. The audio quality and other existing elements within the app are definitely still the same (or I've never paid much attention to them), and currently I don't have much issues with Spotify as a music platform. üëè"
They ruined the app you can't play the song you want to play because it's randomized and you can't play songs on repeat anymore dont download they wants your money(edit) never mind you just can't be poor I bought premium worth it
Bad update. The play / pause button is not available you can't stop podcasts you just have to play another one or put your phone on silent. Pretty much made it un usable.
"Pleasing UI and mainstream catalogue, but need more video game ost catalogue and hifi option"
"Love Spotify, easy access to all my favourite artists at the click of a button."
I love it I play alot on it but I wish that if you don't buy permeuim it doesnt let u go hack one song and it only plays the songs u want in Playlist so uh yea it rlly is good but I think it needs a Lil more work/improvement
"Quite musical EDIT: Could you put the update log on the playstore, I'd like to know what I'm updating"
"I'd say it's a good app My 2 issues with it is in the library section it doesn't stay on downloaded button. It is lost when you exit app would be cool to have a leave where you left off setting. Other issue is if im watching shorts with no sound it now fades away. I didn't turn Spotify off. Understandable when I click on a whole video, but not for the stupid shorts."
need to upgrade to hi-fi quick!!
"Amazing interface, by far one of the best designed apps out there. It feels like every small aspect has been properly researched and tested - excep for adding an album in the queue, pls add it to the end of the queue not in the middle of the album I'm listening to. However casting really sucks. No I'm not listening to the 6-hour version of Imagine! Also I get that you want to add new songs in my playlist based on what I've liked but that screws up the queue and repeats song played before"
Has a quite good range of music
"When using android auto, the next track button on my steering wheel skips two tracks instead of one. This is not a problem when I'm playing music through the system directly (not through android auto)."
"The music player buttons disappeared after the last update. I love the app, please fix!"
Great app but please fix the bar the shows what song is playing and has the pause button! It keeps disappearing and the only way to get it back is to uninstall the app then reinstall it. Been going on for a while now and it is super annoying.
"Music queuing should be more flexible. ie, ability to queue songs up next and later like apple music"
"Service is good, app has some bugs. Play button doesn't change state after a click. I have to close the app to stop audio playback. Occasionally playback stops without any input. App installed on a Galaxy S20+."
"So buggy at the moment, always freezes during songs and quits the app or won't show you want is currently playing... Going to try uninstalling and reinstalling"
"Very good, little to no issues. The only problem I've had is that the now playing bar dissappears every now and then but that just requires you to force stop it from the settings. (Pretty sure this affects only Samsung users, but don't quote me on that)"
"Often times the app screws up by playing music without displaying the button function and album display. This means the app will play a song you select, but wont load the ""now playing"" display. Music plays for a song and a half and then it crashes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, and it still happens. Great for making playlists; not all music is found."
"The desktop app's full screen mode leaves a thin gap between the taskbar and the bottom part of the app. Also, there is no way to change the video quality inside the desktop app. Apart from that, it's great. Especially the UI."
Odd little tidbit: the player disappeared when I hit the back button and the music was still playing :/
"A fantastic App.... transported back in time with a push of a button, where the whole world was open to opportunities, freedom and excitement. I miss those days üòáüëçüèª Only negative is...the App turns itself off every ten-fifteen minutes."
"This is perhaps the best music app But it lacks the feature of editting order of songs in playlists according to our choice.We have to first remove all songs and then add them again.In contrast to youtube music has this feature, we can do so by a button on the right side of each song by which songs can be moved independently according to our choice."
Facing issues after Android 12 update in miui 13 after closing the Spotify app music player not going from notification sectionü§®ü§® and in the player song album art not showing in so many songs.. please provide a fresh and bugs fixes update for Android 12 users its sooo irritating
"I'm a new user and love it so far! My only complaint, as a free user. Is the buildup of ads played at once."
"Spotify has definitely improved a lot since I started using it a couple years ago. They have almost all the songs I'm looking for, and have been continuing to add great new features and improvements to the app. Sometimes it's a little buggy on my Galaxy A71, otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
"I've been using YouTube Music for 3 years but a few days ago I bought Spotify premium edition to see which one is better, To be honest Spotify has better playlists so it's a better app to find your new songs that you like but YouTube Music has a part that mixes songs for you but it changes every week so I think it's not good as Spotify is, But to be honest again YouTube Music has a better design for its app and if you won't spend money for Music application YouTube music's free edition is better"
"The UI is super intuitive, the premium features are cool, it just great overall. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is how it doesn't really pay artist well."
"Spotify has become smoother since my last review, so I have to clear the app out of history a lot less. I'm not a big fan of the new plus button in the bottom right corner. I don't need to make a new playlist so often that a dedicated spot in the menu is necessary and I don't make podcasts at all. This button is functionally pointless for me and moved the other buttons that I used slightly to the left. Overall, still a great app. I'm just nitpicking the constant changes to the UI."
"Hi, I updated my app to the lastest version but I still have problems on lyric sharing. Can't seem to find the button on it even after restarting my phone or clearing the data of the app itself. It would be great if you could help me on this one. Thank you!"
I've used Spotify off and on for quite some time and I like it but if I had to say one thing negative I would say turn the volume down on your ads and that's it!
Very good app for listening ads its been 6 months i am listen to ads but there is some issue sometimes it play songs that ruined my mood of listening ads
I enjoy Spotify and have been using it for quite a while. My only gripe with it is that when listing to an artists mix I wish they played more of the artist and less of the similar artists.
Would be great but the 5 30 second ads kinda ruin it
Found quite the songs I like. I was hoping to get others based on my choices. Great app though.
New update... Why shuffle play button dissappear in liked songs? I want to get random music. There is only play/stop button and second button to loop playing. Please return it back!
I've been using Spotify for quite some time already. And in general it's cool. But recently I started experience problems with playing songs and podcasts in offline mode. And in general I have an impression that app became more laggy. Hope this is temporary.
Good UI but too much ads. Mostly cringe ads.
Amazing i would say I'm not premium member but I didn't give it full 5 star because sometimes the ads are quite often to the point that there would ads after every song and other is that sometimes it just stops working it doesn't show me which song I'm playing so they fixed that i would rate it 5 star without being a premium member
"Gapless playback doesn't work between end and beginning of albums, it ruins the experience of certain albums, especially Nonagon Infinity which is meant to infinity loop. Otherwise it's perfect. Also really good for learning lyrics to songs."
"The shuffle playlist has to be improved. It keeps playing almost the same song over and over again regardless of the huge amount of music I listed in the same playlist; ultimately the reason why I get bored with my favorite songs too quickly. I hope u fix this, cuz I need a shuffle option‚Äînot selective."
"It's more money than I'd like to spend but the ad free unlimited version is worth it. Do wish they would be more understanding with the address verification with family plans as my children travel between my home and my husband as we have been separated. Sucks they don't recognize my son on our family plan bc he's only at my address part of the time. I'd also love if the playlist feature was a bit more intuitive to navigate considering I've had some from back in the ""starred"" era"
"UI looks amazing, and listening experience is also good when compared to other apps. However, ads keep increasing on every new update."
"I love how the app does not require downloads, but the fact you cannot put songs on repeat without premium really sucks"
Great app for streaming. Except randomly stops playing and I have to push the play button to get it going again.
"That last couple update have systematically broken the app. Connections to devices are buggy and intermittent. UI has broken a dozen times a day and won't respond, play anything, and when it does the wrong item will show as playing versus the sound. Can't skip what it doesn't know it's playing!.. Reinstall and restarts are no help. ""No internet connection"" even when I am on the god damn wifi and in a city. Straight up broken at the moment."
"Hi,I love this app but when I play my playlist it as songs I didn't put on it also can you add a loop button I hate that I can't hear my favorite song over and over again I'm sorry if I'm sounding mean but I just want a loop button and not listen to songs that I did add to my playlist please that's all."
I like it but now there is a bug now when I press the repeat button the app crashes that's all I have experienced I will up fate you guys more but still this is a great app!
"It be pretty aight if you don't skimp the premium downloads go by quick on not the best internet so you don't need a GOATED or God CPU ETC, ETC bing bong ¬£u‚Ç¨k ya life‚Ñ¢"
"I love it the only thing is that I wish the UI/UX was more fluid and less boxy, and I wish that I could DISABLE lyrics instead of always having it on"
Love this app.. but why is it everytime I'm in my feels listening to sad music a ad comes on atp I don't even wanna cry anymore u ruined it. U guys are like listening to me cry it seems like it üòª.
The app was great until it changed my play/pause button from middle to left. I asked twitter support for help but they couldn't rectify the problem after multiple attempts. they changed back
"It's the go to app for music. The swipe gesture was a long awaited and great addition. It would be worth 5 stars, but I have unliked songs too many times accidentally due to the position of the like button. If it were only visible inside the player it would mean less accidental touches."
"App crashing of recently , and the search bar gets masked partially by the top indicator panel of the ui , in pixel 4a"
"I just wanna recommend adding the music search quality like ""Shazam"". The one where we can know a song name quicker"
"Hello! I'm new to Spotify and this is my first time using it. I'm loving it so far! I just have a few suggestions, 1. In the music player, we should be able to swipe down and up without having to use the arrow. 2. A double tap to seek for about 10 seconds would be really nice to add. 3. In the mini music player, we should be able to swipe down to get rid of it. 4. More animations when you click the pause and play button would make Spotify better. And 5. Sometimes the app will crash after opening"
I think that the app is great it works well and has atleast 99% of the songs I like saying I'm a k-pop fan but it glitches pretty often I don't know if it happens to other people too but it happens for me quite often please fix this.
Why does the lyrics share button keep disappearing?
"Quite cool and interesting,so far good I can recommend other funs to install it"
"It's alright, I just don't know what to say but I know something isn't intriguing me. I don't know I think old Spotify is better ü§î"
Every update requires that I reinstall the app in order for it to work properly and it will mess up any alarms linked to the app. Stop making things that already work worse!
Good app but quite laggy when moving the audio time.
"Please do include ""Add to playlist"" shortcut as a button.üôÇ"
"Finally Spotify has matured into a decent app worth paying for. A few issues remain: (1) no indicator on playlist screen to show if sequential play or shuffle play is active. Imho there should be two separate buttons, ie a standard play button and a shuffle button with suitable colour change when active. (2) should have an ""AI"" button to play more songs like this based on past listening history. (3) Need ""hey Spotify"" voice commands, especially when driving. Keep up the innovation üëç"
Great app honestly but sometimes when you choose a particular song it plays a completely different song and that's quite annoying but otherwise it's great and highly reccomend
"I personally love this app! The UI is good and the app itself look kinda cute. The music quality is really good. The best part is that it gives my daily mood mixes and weekly mixes too which is very accurate to the kinds of songs I listen. The discover features isn't for discovering random songs but of genres/styles you prefer. The reason to give 4 star is because of too many annoying ads. You can at least remove ads in certain playlists like ""meditation"" or ""study"" Overall it's pretty good!"
"Good app, but it's been quite annoying lately sometimes when I'm playing a game while listening to any music it randomly stops and I have to go back in to fix it, Why does it even do that? It's annoying.."
"Love Spotify, but please move the ""heart"" button so it's not next to the ""cast"" button. I unheart songs all the time and it is so annoying!!! Please move the cast icon to the left of the song titles rather than kn the right next to the play/pause."
"All good except ads. Ads are too annoying to be tolerated! The same ads are played in a loop. Now the app have become quite expensive in its way. Previously it used to give 3 months premium free for any premium pack, but now it reduced to 1 month....."
"App has gotten a lot better. Still prefer the old UI, but eh... What are you gonna do."
"Generally works great. But many times I've used the app the screen freezes, or control bar desappears and I need to quit app for it to appear again. Also, doesn't work well while traveling with google maps directions... it attempts to share screen and map doesn't work well"
Enjoy the largest collection of music with excellent quality and inbuilt adjustments of the app
Nice and all but there's quite a lot of updates?
"It was a decent application with a lot of advertisement. Less gigabits needed for quick music listening in the background. The premium feature isn't even comparable to YouTubes version, since it is often more expensive for less content and sometimes the advertisement can longer, since you can't skip there and all ads r 30sec."
Great app but songs will get stuck and you can't move on from that track no matter what you do to troubleshoot. Spotify is aware of the issue that's been happening for quite some time but no fix in sight.
"Spotify in a nutshell: ""hey this person is genuinely enjoying this song/playlist & playing it often. Y'know what, let's hoard it away & put a bunch of ads in it so that if that person has depression or something worse & this song makes them happy, they can't listen to it! I mean, who cares what they want/do to themselves unless they're paying for premium! üòÄ"" Music is power & you're taking that away with this bs. I'm giving this 4 stars since u don't respond to ur 1 star reviews. fix the system."
"I love the app but there's alot more music that could be out on there, like ""ballout"" by (juice wrld) lol but yeah all in all the app is great"
"Music is great, but Spotify keeps asking for Bluetooth access which I already gave and now the play button moved to the left which is an odd choice. Maybe a bug?"
"The app is tremendously great. The features and everything is convenient ranging from category of music, lyrics of the songs, and etc. The only thing that I find odd is the volume of the songs. They play somehow quiet in the Normal volume range. I suggest that you try to make it louder at that. The lyrics also should be downloaded offline also in case you want to sing but do not have available WiFi connection. That is all. The app is wonderful. But some adjustments would be fine."
I love it but the only thing holding me back from giving this a 5 star is the car UI now being a premium option.
Overall great experience. Shuffle feature could be a bit more intuitive. Would be a 5* otherwise.
"New UI looks sleek but the lyrics powered by Musixmatch it's not synchronised correctly even though the sync timing is correct on the desktop version and in Musixmatch itself. Adding Oled Dark Mode (Pitch Black), dark mode (The Usual) and light mode (System White) would also be great."
Over all experience really good it's just and rather often the app just quits and I'll have to reboot to fire it back up fix that you have yourself a hell of a station Thank you
We want only three bottom buttons > home search library . So please remove 4th premium button in Android app thank you.
"The app overall is a good app but for those who don't get the premium subscription, at first there a re very little ads but as time goes by the number of ads start to increase. Something like 5 ads before a 2 min music. But the ux(user experience) is very good"
Having to reset my phone everytime I get out of my car because the app has recently decided that a pause button is t needed is getting pretty annoying
"I like using this app, nothing is bugging, crashing or causing errors, everything is great. The only thing I complain about is the ""Shuffle"" button in my playlists. I can't select a song on my own because Spotify plays random songs itself,no matter what cover I click, it will autoplay what the cover sounds like and then stop. This may not happen if you buy premium, however not everyone can afford it. My conclusion is that Spotify needs a feature where shuffling is an optional and not permanent."
Would give 5 star if they had less ads honestly ruins the app and in 2022 only rich people cab afford premium bc we all broke
I love this app. It's amazing but the reason I gave it 4 stars is the removal of the loop button. I'd love the app to bring it back without us paying just for that one button which will last like 1 month or something. The app made me disappointed due to the useless removal. And if love if we wouldn't pay for the offline listening too because it's just a uselss removal (again) . The app is amazing but needs those little things back just for the sake of it. I honestly think these removals a bad.
Adverts are a real nuisance:-(
We need more widgets and new widget UI
It was quiet good . And also lyrics is available that help me to understand how to pronounce according to the songs ... I like it.....
"I actually like this app, no complain but i really want spotify to do some changes regarding its lyrics feature. I really like song like punjabi, k-pop, and other languages song i wish i could convert these lyrics in english and could understand the lyrics in better...all i could do is search in Google for it's lyrics which is quite troublesome..."
It's a good app but the background of the app is quiet dull and out dated. I think there should be an option for a light mode like apple music.
"Please allow people to change theme, I personally don't like apps with black design."
I wish I didn't need to retype an artist everytime I add a song to a playlist. It gets annoying when youre not quite sure which version of the song you want or you want multiple songs from the same artist
"Except the fact that there's no dislike button, been using it for at least a month now, and I can say that I've enjoyed every bit of it. üëçüëç But y'all should seriously try to implement the dislike button option aswell"
"Undoubtedly one of the best music app. It has curated the UI very well. Podcasts are also from very wide range. But recently for last 10 days I'm facing a serious issue, the app is not working. Whenever I play any song it just crashes. So i uninstall the app and again install the app, but it didn't work, after few days again it starts working,and again after few days it got crashed. Please üôè kindly solve your bugs."
Hi uhm... Spotify app is really good although the offline button does not work for me please make it work in on Android btw
Old previous/pause/next song design was good. Now they have shifted play button ot the bottom.
"I would like a ""dislike"" button so i can tell the app not to place that song in my randomized lists again. Besides that, this is the best music app."
In love with the app and the musics in particular But i think there should be a download button For each song in an album
"Mobile version for free is pretty awful but as soon as I got a job I was able to pay for the student plan and it's great. I love the local files features, I learned to create folders so I can easily organize all my playlists and the UI is easy to understand"
It's an amazing app for music lovers like me. ads became less than before UI is also good but music recommendation is not satisfying. That's why I rated only 4 star.
"There are many things that the other apps lead in: Amazon and Deezer in HiFi audio (which I hope Spotify will add soon) and Youtube Music in unofficial tracks. However, the reason I have chosen to go with Spotify is because of UI and friends. While YT and Deezer have nice UI's also, they don't have the same aesthetic as Spotify. The only thing I would say is to RELEASE HIGH FIDELITY!! EDIT: I have switched to Tidal until HiFi is released."
"It's quite a good app all the music you want and some you weren't even looking for! Overall, it's a banger and I hope you enjoy the app as much as I did!"
I'm in love with Spotify but ads ruins the experience
"Hello Spotify , I am using spotify Premium for like more than 4 months now. I Love the service , Application UI , Features But One area that need to be work upon is When two people are streaming together , group remote session , I just try with one of my other friend not more . She was using her Laptop and I was streaming from my Phone so whenever I switch to some other song , Her connection to remote streaming is lost she has to join again and again which sometime is really irritating."
"i think getting lyrics from Music Match was a great move. a lot of the lyrics are incorrect and some are incomplete. the Mah 2022 update has been quite glitchy, often forcing the app to stop abruptly"
"Only recent issue I've discovered is that for some reason, the Spotify info quit displaying on my Galaxy A71 AOD screen!? I've tried everything and still quit working a month ago!"
Sometimes The Playlist I am playing not plays the next song it plays any other song from a old playlist I selected (Even After I close and open again it doesn't get fixed). Kindly make a refresh button for songs or playlist. Thank You
"Great app except for 1 crucial missing feature - Bring back the dislike/hide button feature. If I don't want to listen to something, I should have the option to hard block/hide it"
"For whatever the reason, my layout is completely messed up. You know when you listen to a song and the pause button is in the middle surrounded by previous and next? Well not for me. And I have no idea why it is like that. I tried logging out and in and it goes back to normal but the moment I exit the app it messes up again."
What happened to the shuffle feature? That big button at the top was ideal.
im loving the spftware but the ui is not to the bar its laggy sometimes and i think there should be an option to reshuffle songs in playlists
Brilliant if u buy premium which is quite expensive. If u don't by premium it's rubbish and better using YouTube but if u can afford it it's definitely worth it.
"I think Spotify is the best music app. It's not perfect though, the UI still feels choppy and laggy sometimes, the songs aren't that highest quality that we assume they are. And the songs queue interface instill bad. But apart from that, Spotify's algorithm is just the industry leading. I mean I just cannot use any other music streaming service to listen and explore music at the same time. And some Spotify exclusive podcasts."
I love spotify so much. There's a ton of songs and it's an overall great app. I wish spotify premium wasn't so expensive though. 10 dollers a month is quite steep for what your getting.
I love how you can build your own playlist
"has stopped working, just a second after pressing the play button the app crashes, every time."
"Spotify is one of those apps thats hyped up so much that people expect to much from it. Without premium it's an add fest but with it it's better by about 100%. Unlimmited skips, no annoying ads, and good quality when streaming. the only things I find annoying about the app is 1. It has a remove all downloads button directly above clear cache and I've deleted all downloads so many times when trying to clear cache. 2. The quality of the app is getting progressively worse with many many updates"
"It's great but they don't watch movies or shows for the songs English translation, I'm bubble the movie there is an English translation of bubble the song and in how the realist rebuilt the kingdom their is a English version of one of aimi songs. They could also do different versions, for the non English speakers and the English speakers."
"Attention Spotify? you probably won't read this but I always want to give suggestions so here I go. - when you search up playlists I wish you had a ""sort"" button for I can choose the playlist with the most likes. - I wish you had a ""select all"" button or a ""mass select"" type option on our liked songs list and gave us the option to make the songs we chose a playlist that's about it. thanks for reading."
Please turn off the bluetooth headphone requirements. We shouldn't have to solely rely on Spotify's casting software to be able to listen to music via just the watch speaker. Every time i pause on the watch i have to play it from the phone again or the watch app wants me to connect a pair of headphones.
I wish it would quit showing the same music every day but other than that it's a very good app and you can always find any song or album that you were looking for.
Cant get reception occasionally. The music will plY the first tune but will stop in the second tune.Will play again on pressing any button. Plz help
"Quite useful and entertaining, however, there are some downsights for instance; not being able to listening to unpopular musics or the special covers of the musics are limited most of the time. What I mean is the song variety is not the way that I want it to be. Other than that, the best music app which provides the suprerior sound quality among the others."
It's very nice but you can't really listen to individual songs and if you don't have premium the ads can get quite annoying. Besides that it's awesome!
Noice app üëç but should work on lyrics interface.It looks quite boring
"I've been using Spotify Premium for years but lately it's been crashing more, my downloads haven't been appearing properly and the user experience has been sub par."
I just updated the app. And there seems to be a problem with the widget. It's unable to load. Any fix? I'm on Android 9 EMUI 9.1 Huawei Y9 2019
"I love the design and the delivery. I just realised it compatible with my Google Mini Home, and booom, its fun üòÑ time."
After a while I am discovering new good music upon my musical taste. I don't really like the way you've shuffled the play buttons.
Did the menu change for anyone else because my play and stop button are on the left now and the skip buttons (both directions) are next to it on the right so it's not symmetrical and it's honestly giving me anxiety and i want it back the way it was before :( other than that and the fact some songs aren't on there it's a great app
"I love the enhance feature, but for some reason the enhance feature for my liked songs has dissapeared. That enhance feature was quite useful, so i'm quite dissapointed it doesn't work for my likes playlist anymore"
Op... But there should be 10 sec forward button in phone version too... And why discover button is not available for me anymore
It is quite good. It can get 5 stars but the only problem is that whenever I want to read any song's lyrics it just says no internet connection but it plays all the song perfectly. I even tried reinstalling it but it didn't work. It can be the perfect app only if you solve this problem. It is a request to please have a look at my problem and try to solve it as fast as possible. Otherwise it is the best app that can ever be.
"Hmmm the new session joining is inconsistent. And requires you to have to the other people's Handphone number. Or telegram. Not joining the same device as host anymore eg. if I (non host) were to play YouTube, it would end up pausing the entire session. Spotify sharing links not working"
Quite a few ads but really good!
"SPOTIFY IS SUPERB, but ADS makes me wanna suicide. Please do something of these ads. And it would be awesome if you guys made organising and customizing playlists more easy and compatible. But come on, please do something of the ads. (YOURS ADS MAKES MORE SURE TO NOT BUY YOUR PREMIUM)"
the playback fails when you hit the 15 sec back button. it does not work especially hitting it repeatedly to go back a few minutes. Its quite irritating when podcast listening and driving.
Best app for music! The free version is itself well enough and you can listen songs from various artists and it is really cool. The UI is simple and you can customize the app's interior‚ù§Ô∏è..I love this app!
The now playing widget that shows when you're on other apps or the lockscreen has disappeared on my Samsung S21 Ultra. Was helpful when you want to quickly skip tracks. Now have to go back in to the app to do this. Not major but a bit annoying. Any fix for this?
"Very good app to listen to music on, I use it almost daily. Just one thing is that they recently removed the shuffle play button. I hear why they did and it makes sense, but I think it should be added back for personal playlists. Overall great app"
It suits my feelings n emotion the choices n collection of the songs for me.
"This app is amazing, but the new update ruined it, i prefer the penultimate version ( one before this )"
This app is quite good i use it when drawing and the playlists are just what i like my only complaint is that the music will start playing randomly i will just be siting on my phone playing a game And it will start playing the previous song i was just listing to other then that its a pretty good app.
Why is the play pause button way off to the left and the skip forward backwards are in the middle? Did someone misplace a 0 and a 1? It looks ridiculous and makes 0 sense why it's not skip pause skip like it used to be. P.S. If you're to cheap to pay to listen to your favorite artists you deserve ads. Expect a premium service for free? LOL
"Great app. I like how easy it is for me to find songs and follow my favourite artists. The UI/UX is beautiful. Four stars because when playing a track in the background and you wish to shuffle the song or repeat it, it can't be done from the notification panel, you'll have to personally open the app again just do do something as trivial as that. It will be great if the repeat and shuffle button shows in the notification panel when playing from the background."
I personally love this app but the problem is the shuffle button. You can't click on shuffle unless you bought premium.
"Spotify is the og especially if you have premium, however, I really really wish they switched the controls back around. You know, where the play button is in the middle üòê"
"This app is terrific and it's quite easy to use, but sadly there are a few caveats, sometimes the app appears to be broken, due to it not wanting to play any songs from a different playlist I pick, only works when I force stop the app and clear the cache."
Very nice app but please return the enhance button for liked songs
"it works better than okay, but i don't quite like the current application design. Also the part were the artist is featured could use some wikipedia integration..."
Very good and user friendly app. Must download. Satisfied with Spotifyüòä Edit: I still love this app but now there are three ads after almost every song and sometimes the ads are quite inappropriate too. So one star less. Overall a great app.
"With the recent update, the pause/play button didn't need to go on the left side. Other than that, this app is wonderfully neat!"
"With the latest update, the positioning of the keys in the song interface has changed and it is different from the positioning we are used to. Difference is nice, but this is not... Old version was much nicer and beautiful and also it was easier to use but now it is really useless both in design and functionality. I hope they get it reinstated as soon as possible."
"The new UI is terrible. The button order during playing is so bad. Every music player ever, has had the previous-play-next order. The play on the left is is a total interface development failure."
"this afternoon I got a glitch where the ui button moved, but it didn't affect the audio quality."
"Very solid app. Recently lots of issues with freezing and not loading albums/playlists at all, requires a force stop to work again."
Love the app. Minus one star because what's with the new button layout?? The pause button is on the left of the screen -.- I like how it was before
"Great selection and integrations. Point loss for UI though. Could give users more control and could have more features, especially in the podcast space. Automatic podcast downloads being the first thing that comes to mind."
Excellent quality tracks to stream or download. Library quite extensive though can't find every one of my favorites. App seems to crash and corrupt my account leading to my downloaded songs having to be re downloaded every time phone restarts or battery dies which is VERY boring!!!
You want to add a random music button for them who dont want to search and you can play there top song from 1-100.
Spotify has everything I need but I'm constantly looking away to the phone on the road to change songs because of the hassle with that dam shuffle button
"I love this app so so so much but... my day was ruined when I opened the app and there was a new layout of the buttons, like it's awful I hate it so much I can't describe how awful it is AND it's inconvenient. I just don't know why you would change it in the first place no one said it should change and It just looks ugly like an random website you would find when you're a kid. Idk is just so bad please do something about this"
I love Spotify but.... In the latest update the play button has moved from being between the skip and backskip buttons to be to the left of both of them. This makes me physically sick whenever I look at it I genuinely consider cancelling my subscription.
"I had a 5 star rating before this, but with the new update the layout on the phone app completely changed. The play/pause button is now on the left side and it's not very convenient. Would appreciate it if it's changed back to the previous layout."
"As a Spotify Free user, this update is very bad. In fact, whenever i create my own playlist and add songs that i love i kept pressing the 2 green arrows, it's shuffle play button won't go off. There is 30 minute clip and they wont play the entire song. Please be good to the users who are encounerting the same issue."
Amazing app! Been using it for almost 2 and a half years. But lately the app has been faking the time for ex: the real time is 1:30 but the song says 0:00 not letting me restart the song very quickly like i used to. Hopefully you fix it soon but other than this its awesome
"Great user experience, with varied music catalogue. Perhaps a Hi-fi resolution would be the icing on the cake."
"It's been my streaming platform of choice since 2016 (at least), every update it's just as intuitive, the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because, sometimes, it can reset my downloads out of nowhere, and that can be inconvenient since I'm always on the go and in a need of music, other that, wouldn't change it for anything."
Overall great app. Sometimes however the bottom bar with the buttons disappear and I have to restart the app to get them back.
Great app. Recent update moved the play/pause button to the left side and I feel likes it's more difficult to use in app now
The GUI needs more developing
"Ive been with Spotify for years and it's always been fine but like with other people it has recently got really buggy. It crashes and freezes quite often now. Other than that I love Spotify and when it works its really user friendly and the music suggestions, discover weekly, release radar etc are 10/10"
"a few bugs and glitches with the UI, but besides that it's pretty solid for music."
I only have one complaint and that is where did the enhance a playlist button go. I really enjoyed that for expanding my playlists
"I love this app as i can support my favourite artists, although quite disappointed with the sound quality even with ""very high"" setting, as my downloaded mp3 sound better. I'm a non-Japanese that is obsessed with Japanese game music so i'm quite disappointed that some songs are region-locked, especially Ensemble Stars songs."
Enjoy your music an love hearing threw my Bundy rum sounds cube as sounds even better but finding the are more ads then what I l sure on a hr maybe 3 hrs to many ads even thou you skip but you only get 6 skips. Ok thank you for your time and consideration hopefully you mite send me a prize or something ahhh cheers stay Cool loses the ads ore music video ECT but alot of ads usenin up my data quick ummm but u love your selection of music to get down and boogie and dancing and you're singing the i
"It is a great app to listen to music but what would be better,i suggest they would add the just play one song or play the whole playlist button on the notification bar."
"This app is good but it takes a while to get used to it.I've been using for few years and I had to find out why it suddenly stopped playing my playlist in order and started playing random tracks.It quite often goes off on its own and plays tracks not chosen by me,This in the settings somewhere took me ages to find it.There are other numerous odd things it does on its own.Which can be quite annoying."
"Really good collections, you can find all trending tracks and also variety of genres to suit your mood, am really loving it"
"Honestly wish there was more variety of advertisements. I dont wanna be hearing the same ad after trying to sleep with my playlist on, but I guess its supposed to be annoying so we can buy premiumüò≠ also sometimes the play/pause buttons disapppear from my lock screen and my playlist randomly pauses??"
"Hi, I'm having a little bit of an issue, why does my next, pause, button keep disappearing? It's frustrating a little bit. And this just started like a few weeks ago, before it never happened! What's going on with this? Thanks in advance."
"Filter for playlist should be more accessible. Now just on the top, there must be a button or something to acces from anywhere you are on the playlist."
"Been a user since 2010 beta when they were really new and it still feels fresh, fast and expanding. It needs a light/dark-mode for PC, better implementation off messaging, more lyrics, UI Themes or customizable layouts with more visualisations... so it is pretty chunky in file size /cpu usage for being a media player buffering from a connection but..so there is still room for improvements"
Ive been using this app for quite a few years and it is amazing. I use it everyday at work.
"The quick access banner on my notification panel is not there anymore. I have to find the app, open it and then change/pause the song. what happened?"
Sometimes it just stops playing after 20 to 30 minutes and I have to press play again....and....sometimes the double bar pause or stop button is not shown. Otherwise happy.
"As a premium user, I can't comment on the ads since I don't get any. The daily mixes have gotten a lot better. Newer features like finding music from lyrics on search bar are actually helpful and intuitive. It would be better if it had different audio options like 8D. Also they do not have ALL songs like yt which could be annoying."
Just got Spotify this past weekend and so far I have no complaint. Only wish that in your Playlist near the top there was a shuffle button. It would make playback easier than having to find the shuffle when you select a song. Not a deal breaker but still would make it easier
Absolutely great service just wish it was a little bit more predictive and intuitive like my YouTube music
Great selection with amazing Playlist builds have noticed however previously available comtent is no longer viewable or not easily found
Play button is just a white circle in dark mode. No download option per song. Podcast should have a separate section instead of mixing between songs in homepage.
"great option, need a military or veteran discount like students get. still hard to find my podcasts, not very intuitive"
"Usually great, but the enhance button will sometimes glitch out and shorten the playlist as well as recommend already added songs"
"Sometimes, the play button doesn't appear after I've clicked a song. The song plays, but I can't pause, skip, or repeat it. I have to exit the app then open it again for the buttons to appear. Please fix this! Aside from that, the features all work well."
"I'm giving it 4 stars, not 5, only for 1 reason. You can't select multiple songs at once to move in or out of a playlist, which means if you wanna build a playlist, it takes a lot longer than it should. It should be the same way your Gallery works, how you can tap and hold to move many pics / files at once. Other than that, spotify is awesome. Having millions of songs at your fingertips for the price of 2 starbucks coffees a month? Worth it =)"
"There's a reason why it's one of the best music streaming apps but the UI is too... boring, to me. Basically the experience is not all that. We also need individual downloads, especially with albums. I can't always like every song in an album."
The app is great. I only hate it when the queuing thing doesn't work.
"The pausing issue that started a month ago seems to be resolved in the past week, as well as the disappearing player controls. Thanks to the support staff for the quick replies to my email and for results that I could see."
"The app is quite good, but I don't know why the songs are downloaded everytime I open the app, though I have premium. It must be downloaded one time only, so that I can listen them anytime. That's why I have listen them online, despite having premium account."
"Spotify is my favourite music app. loads of wonderful music of course plus: podcasts, artist pages, song lyrics, easy to use search explore function, play-lists, etc, all lead to a wonderful experience. What really sets Spotify above the other apps though is it's layout, very easy to use and very nice design. I would have given the app 5‚≠ês because i really love it but Spotify loses a star for how it does ads. 15/30 second ad every 15/20 min. or 1, 1 minute video for 30 mins music, would be good."
"If you streaming audio to WiFi loudspeakers, the app itself sometimes can't manage the volume. Usually it requires app restart to see the volume for remote speaker. Another annoying thing are podcasts. At the moment it's virtually impossible to find out podcasts by given language. One more thing, recently observed bug when Spotify is playing something but there's no play menu inside the application, it just literally vanishing from the app. Only application restart solving this."
"I love the app. Good user experience but i have a concern. I would have loved a shuffle button at the top when i open 'My Library' so i can shuffle songs including playlists, albums and downloaded songs altogether. Sometimes i like to listen to songs from different genre while carrying out a task. Doesnt have to be necessarily songs that have same sound. If that's done it will be a 5star for me. Great job guys."
"The episode playing never shows, it's always a previous episode you've listened to and never updates. Spotify also stops playing constantly, ruins the episode. I'm going back to reliable podcast addict app. Edit: things have worked fine the past year, just need to keep updating."
Has all my music selection. Always on in my car or on my Alexa. Some glitches where the play and next button dissappear. Also can't use it on my galaxy watch which is disappointing as it never connects.
"Love it but I've been noticing that songs I've previously liked are suddenly not in my liked songs and I have to find them again. I just added a new song this morning and noticed tonight that it is not there anymore and had to find it again, I think that's the quickest a song has ever disappeared."
When I press add song I used to have a little button where if I pressed it I could listen to the song for a while but now it's gone please add it back and the equalizer
It's really good the ads are alittle unbareable sometimes but I'm having issues usally you can loop songs and anonymous shuffle playlist on spotify for samsung smart tv but when I click loop on my samsung tv it's not letting me loop at all but the buttons are still there can I get any help to solve this?
"It has some bugs, like for example the music button dissapears but the music goes on. Besides that, really good."
"Very good intuitive selection of similar music based on listening habits. Easy to use, easy to explore."
"From my point of view.. This app is awesome... Well maintained UI, dark theme, variety of songs, millions of playlist and more... Can try an awesome app for music, soundtracks, podcasts and more... One thing which is missing is we can't download songs. Rest is fine"
Some times spotify will stop playing. Also will not show the play or pause button
"Just a few suggestions that i am pretty sure are very easy to implement in the app as i am a sorta dev myself too. 1)Show me which song is going to be played next. 2)Add functionality to make playlist groups so that its a bit easy to organize many playlists 3)Add button to shuffle playlist the random play button next to play/pause isn't actually completely random from what i know after all this time, instead i guess maybe it just picks the best songs to play first"
"Spotify has a extensive music library. Chances are if you want they have it . But there mobile set up is poor for any kind of customizing, it's extremely difficult to build a play list if you have a lot of music to add , and no way to simply remove a song from your Playlist. Makes it very difficult to build your play list if you plan on listening to any music while your offline or out of service areas."
"Great app but recently it will not play sometimes. I press the play button and nothing happens, or a song or podcast will play but the controls are not visible just the podcast or song list. Can't turn it off unless I shut off the app. This is happening more."
Can't use any other app now that I've used Spotify. Like it's UI. The one thing I wish it had was it's previous group session. The newer remote only group session isn't working well.
"A very solid music streaming app, fairly easy to use, but it's most defining feature for me is its ability to automatically create playlists using the music you listen to. The playlists will have new music suited to your tastes and music you already love! Dropped a star as the consistently rotating home screen means sometimes you cannot find something you are looking for that was open last tike you opened it."
"Good app,would recommend,but he Spotify connect feature and the UI is a little buggy"
"Recent update caused issues. App would simply stop playing, and play, skip, etc buttons vanished. All fixed. Re-reviewed."
Love the app but I can't figure out how to turn off shuffle? üòï I don't see a button to press and it's confusing- I probably am just dumb Edit: I Uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it still didn't work- I saw stuff saying that should work Edit 2: I made a new account and it worked!
love the app !! but theres an issue. when i go to add my songs to my playlist. its says 'add songs' i press on it but theres no play button near the songs i wanna add... what if i like that song... youve just removed a feature that i like about this stupid app üíÄ
Good app wish wash cheaper paid for premium for quite awhile got bored with it lol
Getting use to hunting for the delete que button and apparently there is none!
Lately the app has been very buggy and the pause/play bar at the bottom disappears and I have to restart the app to pause or skip to the next song. I hope this issue can be promptly resolved as it is quite frustrating for an app I spend a lot of time using.
"Hey, great app, been using it for many many years, using premium account and so far I was quite happy with the service. But recent bugs are really annoying, I cant check the song that is playing and today music started to stop playing for no reason dozens of times during day. Please! Fix it asap."
What's going on with the app? You can't pause or start music if it's playing. Just rollback to previous build lol
"For those using Samsung phones and the play button won't show up, close out the app and clear its cache then open it up. The play button should pop up again, this worked for me and I hope it works for those who stumble upon this!"
"This app is incredible! I've tried so many music apps, but trust me, I was not satisfied with any of them except this one. Most of the times, I wouldn't like it's UI and or it will be a paid app. But Spotify has the best UI and collection of songs and most importantly, the best podcasts which no other app offers. Disadvantages: 1) Sometimes the ads are too annoying. 2) It consumes a good amount of storage."
"Would give 3 stars, if not for my history with this app. Please get it back to shape. Some design decisions are hard to understand, some technical aspects reminds rather an alpha version than long developed mature application. Let me give you 5 stars back again."
"Like a lot of other reviewers, I've been pretty happy with the app, however the recent glitches where the music won't stop playing & the now playing tab keeps disappearing is quickly getting to be more trouble than it's worth. I've had to force stop the app at least half a dozen times just today. Please fix these issues."
"Long time user but the last update, April 2022, introduced a super annoying bug. I can't see/pause/ff the song being played until I restart. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly."
"Had to install an earlier version, since discover weekly stopped allowing me to select a song, and is requiring me to shuffle. Besides that and the amount of ads, not a bad music app"
"Easy , applicable & friendly to newcomers....great app to build up your vibes"
"I'd give 5 stars but the ""play"" button & track keeps disappearing so I can't pause or change the song. I have to restart my phone. Otherwise, I love Spotify! I also wish the musicians got better compensation üôÇ"
I download this some week ago it's good but recently there are times that whenever I play a song the panel where it has the play and all those buttons could not be seen. Even in the notification box you won't see the song playing even though it's playing. Hope this gets fixed soon.
"A bit buggy on mobile (Android 12 One UI 4.1), sometimes controller doesn't show what's actually playing, in app player may not show although a song is playing. These are quite big bugs, but I still give 4 stars. Patch it and you'll get 5 from me :)."
"Android users quick fix! Downgrade your application to an older version. Uninstall application, download SDK from oficial Spotify website and reinstall the app from SDK, don't forget to stop updating the app afterwards!!!"
"Hi Spotify, Lately when I play a music in Spotify app, my play bar doesn't displayed. This issue is oftenly happens. I have to kill the app and open again to resolve it. This is annoying. I'm using Samsung Galaxy A52 with One UI 4.1."
"Superb awesome music streaming App available in the whole world! Everything works flawlessly, UI is superb and it's dark feels so much better than other apps. I can listen to music and podcasts online/offline I just need canvas feature and 2FA authentication sign-in for this. Would be great."
"Nice app üëç I would say best ever UI ever scene, even that concept of advertisement between songs are not so creepy as YouTube ‚ò∫Ô∏è, they are funny as well. Thanks Spotify for providing a great service from yours side."
Really the best app for listening to music . Totally enjoy my playlists where the songs are picked for me.The plans are somewhat feels satisfying .The UI is so simplistic and usually there are no or close to very few ads in this app
"Just download the app and it's great , it doesn't use a lot of data. I can't just find the download button."
"Terrible UI update, now it's super messy and unorganized. Hate."
I have an android so I used YouTube music but when I found out Spotify doesn't require money I rushed to sign in unlike YouTube music when I turn on off my phone it still works
Lol music quality is good but the ads are just kinda annoying and when im sleeping and listening to Spotify the ads are just kinda really annoying in my phone theres no repeat for the song since i always like my music in repeat for other i dont know i guess they have the repeat button but i dont have the repeat song button so yeah i only hibe it 4 stars.
"Updated 04/14/2022: The app is overall good but recent updates over the past year have made it less stable on my galaxy S7, and man their podcast UI is pretty mediocre compared to castbox Original post: [5 stars] It's good"
"Hey spotify, i can't express how I'm in love with spotify but still you can add features like 10sec seek time but double tapping the album posters on both the sides. And also change the widget UI."
Wish they don't get rid of the dislike button but still like the app as a whole.
"Love the content and library available. I've been using it for years but recently it's quite buggy - my song just stop playing after minutes, or the playing bar is missing, which disable me from pausing the song."
"Needs an update, the bar at the bottom which shows what's playing, together with buttons like play/pause, skip keeps disappearing, so I have to do a ""force stop"". Also can you please ensure I can access my downloads when I'm offline? That's surely the point of downloading them."
"For me, spotify is the best streaming platform for people who have other things to do on their phone but still want to listen to music. This app has been with me for aslong as i can remember and you dont need premium to use it while using other apps. Though it is quite a bit laggy, In my pc, it repeats the first 6 seconds of a song over and over, and you have to restart the song inorder to play the song. Overall great app though"
"Great app of course, but there's a new bug since about a week. The play bar at the bottom disappears, or never even appears at all. Same with the music card in my notification shade (BT buttons then don't work either). Music does play and there is no lag, but if i want to skip a song I have to clear the app about once or twice, only to lose it again after some half hour. OP7pro It even begins to quit around twice a day during studying, needing me to restart the app"
Would be 5 stars but 4 because I cant find a few songs which sucks... however a 5 for overall user experience and quality.
"Lyrics' line spacing after the last update became too large, previous one was giving a prettier look to the lyrics section. I understand the purpose (Make it easier to distinguish between lines while reading, maybe), but I suggest to only apply this large line spacing when there is a back to line (in the lyrics source) or whatever it's called. Now, there is that large space even when it's the same line but split in two due to space constraint."
"The songs, sound quality and the UI are all great....but the ads, the ads were the issue because of which I shifted from gaana....but it started here as well....better than gaana yeah but still to many ads...and just a suggestion, u should add an option to update blends instantly....if the ads are reduced this is the greatest songs app"
Love this app but it's bugging out the last month or so. It randomly won't show the play bar and I have to force stop and the open (at least once a day) and it also just randomly stops playing when I'm connected to by earbuds (not quite as often but it's still annoying). Please fix!
Everything is really good...ü•∞ Best app for all the songs to hear and that too according to ur mood..ü§©But oy reason to rate 4‚òÖ is IT IS A HELL OF ADS WHICH MAYBE MORE THAN 2 TO 3 MINUTES... THIS MAINLY RUINS OUR MOOD AND EXCITEMENT OF HEARING SONGS..üòëüò∂HOPE THIS WILL BE FIXED SOON... BUT ALWAYS A SPOTIFIAN..üòÅüòâ
Been using the app for a while now and up until i got a new phone Samsung s22 it was fine but now i keep loosing the buttons to play the music and csn only get them back by restarting the phone. Is this a known or new bug. Other wise the app is great .
"I would have given it 5 ,but there's every other day that the app just keeps playing none stop and it doesn't show me the pause button at all. For example the past 2 days. It's very annoying"
"Genuinely love this app. Want to give it 5 stars. But it's just that the auto play isn't as good as YouTube music. It repeats the song if I search for something and play it. Apart from that, even algorithm for playlist creation is awesome."
So things have changed. The ui is way better there are some bugs that need to be fixed. But the app is working better
"Right now it keeps crashing and the play and pause buttons keeps disappearing, super annoying"
"Mostly good, a lot of wifi connection issues, seems to have trouble connecting to the internet over wifi at times, will have to switch to data to use. ... Connection issues seem to have resolved. However the player (now playing+ controls) seems to have disappeared from the UI. Can still play, but no longer see the now playing interface on the app, nor in my task drawer."
"Not flawless, every update brings annoying bugs. For some goddamn reason they want to change the ui."
"Hello, I noticed the app, whenever I paused it, then will try to play it again, the play button or recently playing is gone"
I couldn't process my payment with DANA because of the bad UI. Didn't the developer teams do a testing before they released this version of Spotify? Didn't they realize that users couldn't even input the PIN to confirm the payment because the buttons were so large (they didn't fit my mobile screen!) and I couldn't scroll/swipe it..? How am I suppose to confirm my premium payment??
"ORIGINAL 2/2022: New design is nice, but as someone with a constantly growing collection of about 2,700 liked songs, I hate how the grabber on the scrollbar was removed. It now takes forever to scroll through that long list just to pick the song I want. If you could bring that back, I'll change this to 5 stars üòä EDIT 11/4/2022: It's back, thanks! üòÅ"
The app is good like real good but it would be nicer if I can the language of the lyrics provided......like a translate button
The app is good. The design is cool. The algorithms for selecting similar music are great. But I'm not particularly a fan of advertising.
"Great but when I stream over wifi to my Google nest, the app just starts skipping songs and then will only play 9 seconds of a song and be quite after a while. Doesn't do this on Bluetooth or through my phone. Please fix this!"
"This is a great app but I am facing a problem where everytime I dont play a music 4 a while n when I pressed the play button the numbers that shows how long the song is doesnt move n when is finished it doesnt shows the picture of the next song, it just shows the same picture of the song I just played pls fix this."
"I love Spotify... For the most part. The only downfall, in my opinion, is the fact that Spotify on Android Auto is missing some features. Please add the ability to queue songs on Android auto (through voice commands, and a button on the screen), and please also add the ability to search for songs (using an on screen keyboard, not only voice commands)."
"wish there was an easier way to add songs from a playlist or queue into another playlist on mobile, for example if swiping right adds a song to the queue, swiping left could open up the add to playlist menu. would be quicker than the three dots menu the app's got now."
This app is really neat! One recommendation for it would be to add a search button just so that you can have a wider variety of music and podcasts in the watch app. Thanks!
"Its a great app I guess? Just one problem though... THE ADS. Well I mean like ads are used for money im not that dumb. But imagine this, you're jamming to a playlist and suddenly ADS. Thats quite annoying isnt it? I think the devs should try to do something about it (Not removing ad features) Other then ads problem its a great app. (Im not a premium guy and dont want to pay monthly"
Best music player! What would make it better?: 1) swipe to add to queue everywhere also in search 2) that downloads dont automatically delete themselves as downloads 3) easy button always to go to queue
So you fix the radio but know the like button isn't working
"Love the app, it has quickly become my #1 music source/player. However, I noticed recently that when paired with my car it doesn't show artist/song details like it was doing before. How do I fix this? I can still control the music with my steering wheel controls so it isn't the end of the world. Just a lil frustrating."
"One of, if not THE best app to listen to music! An amazing sharing experience, a wonderful collection even though geolocking causes problems and, with the introduction of the ""Add to Queue"" feature for albums, radio recommendations and more, Spotify has seamlessly made the user experience that much more organic and immersive! One star shy of a full score because of recurring technical issues (app crashing frequently, downloaded songs unavailable) and unintuitive ""Library"" section."
"It's great to be able to listen to any music that you want at anytime and make playlists. Really good stuff. Only thing is that I am unable to find the function that allows you to fluidly move back and forth on the as you would using a DJ app. Would be great if Spotify would incorporate a DJying app/ component, complete with all the tweaks like sirens, scratching, voice overs etc. Otherwise, Spotify just opened a whole new world of music listening pleasure. Love it!"
I love Spotify. My only complaint is that the UI is ugly and boring. It's not as attractive and as premium looking as Apple Music. I'd appreciate it if improvements are made soon.
Great access to a huge amount of music. The app could be a little more intuitive.
"I love Spotify. Please, when send new features for test, keep available in the home, because sometimes we need exit screen and, when back isn't more available. But we have experiemnt new features please! Add optional button to skip."
"Ads too many,but the song quality is quite good"
Its a wonderful experience except where it keeps cutting off after 3 songs which is quite annoying
"Super experiences, but add features to control music inbuilt for beginner users, like Samsung music"
"Simple, elegant and easy to use music player. It has a good recommendation system, the UI is easy and clean, you can make playlists and share to others, or listen to other people's playlists, this allows to share music tastes with eachother. The ads aren't that annoying, they only come every 30 minutes and the subscription service for it is cheap aswell. If you love music, this is an obvious must-have, with all the features right off the bat for free, I wouldn't see why you shouldn't try this."
Would be a 5 star if I could select multiple songs when rearranging a Playlist. Otherwise great job fixing many little things that improved overall user experience thanks Spotify team
"Awesome collection of music, very intuitive interface and easy to cast to other audio devices. What's lacking is hd audio, else a 5 star app"
"The app is good and i can listen to almost 99% of the music i want, only problem.after every 4 songs the ad plays which is quite annoying but anyway the overall experience is really good.I love spotify."
Love it it gots all of my favorite songs that I really love and listen to alot but I hate that they put ads It just ruins the music im listening to it just ruins the vibe
"Best app for listening to music. I just wish they had more songs that I've heard, and I'd like if they'd put a speed up or slow down button for songs like they have for podcasts."
Better than YouTube because there aren't any simply guitar ads at the end and before each song.
"When I play any one specific song. Spotify tends to revert to some Playlist of the same 10 or so songs, over and over again. It's quite frustrating"
"Great selection and audio quality, app runs well and the UI is easy and clear to navigate."
So none of my songs will play. They show a play button but only play for a few seconds. Why?
"Great app if you have premium, a bit annoying that once a playlist gets too long (like liked songs) it's almost impossible to see all the old songs you liked from years ago outside of spamming the shuffle button or going to your rewind."
"I have been using Spotify for a long time. The collection, recommendation algorithm and the dark simple UI is what has made me stay. It's perfect."
"Pretty cool app, they messed up some perfectly good features for a better design but nothing too major."
"It's a great app for discovering new music, and one of the latest updates that suggests a new weekly play list to suit your style is great. But it would be nice to leave reviews on podcasts like Apple allows."
Song recommendations are good. Bollywood recommendations need to improve. Ads should decrease. English lyrics are really required for non-English songs.
"Found a quite annoying bug. When pairing with my PS4 and using the mobile version to control, on every single activity/page I (re)enter pops up a dialog asking me if I want to keep using the PS4 to listen or change to the Phone speakers. Even after I answer to keep it on the PS4. Besides that the only thing missing is a 2-factor-authentication. Anything else is quite nice."
"Too many ads, when you play two songs the ad will come and ruin your mood. So please , resolve this issue . I am using spotify from last two years . I can find any song here but ad is my main issue and some playlist are waste which spotify can remove ."
"Generally a solid app, but as of writing this review, a small annoying issue has cropped up where, if I'm using the mobile app to control the music on a different device (my Xbox, for example) and I go off the app, every time I come back to the app it asks me if I want to continue listening on the Xbox, despite usually being able to keep running fine in the background. A small issue, but one that can become increasingly annoying quite quickly if not fixed. Had never happened before today."
"Great app, and really intuitive! There is only one problem that stops me from giving it five stars. I'm an opera lover, and I want at the very least a synopsis and a full libretto, in more than one language. After all, you (generally) get this when you buy the CD, so why not on Spotify? I find myself having to hunt around on the internet for the libretto. Sometimes it's almost impossible: poor quality librettos, poor translations etc. Sometimes it's completely unavailable."
"Great design. Liked songs loading is... Poor. 10% loaded, others are forgotten, visible on many playlists."
"Till Now, i have Spotify 5 stars, Best UI, Top quality music, user friendly experience and much more, but lately, you beggars started adding 2-2 ads every time and that too more frequently, 1 min of waste, earlier, i could have a 30 sec and and then go on playing for sometime, but now, its turned to trash, soon shifting to other app. You people are pure beggars, come on roads, I'll donate a rupee."
The UI changes from week to week. Why to constantly change the GUI? Edit: There are short 5-6 sec long videos streamed over both mobile data and wifi; even for premium users. -Fixed thank you! Edited rating from 3 to 4 stars!
"The app is really good..so far. We get the lyrics for english songs and its great as we can sing the song we love but nowadays the app quits on its own its so frustrating..hope it gets better soon, doesn't have a nice lyrics for Punjabi but its all good"
This is a very good app but they stop offering periuim membership because we don't have enough money to buy it
"Wonderful. It's a good thing. Just that often, the song doesnt display. And sometimes it stops by itself. Which is quite frustrating. Thanks, all in all good app."
"It's been working great, but I'm experiencing some bugs. For example the x button to clear a song isn't functioning."
"It's so frustrating that the app adds random songs to your library without asking if you wamt them there in the first place, I'll literally add 5 songs in the evening to listen to and the next morning, there are literally 30 songs In my playlist/folder/library. Please add a side button that will keep suggested songs Seperate from one's you have chosen specifically, so that there's no mess up"
"This app is really good for listening to a wide range of music and podcasts. The only problem I have is when my account randomly decides to log out and the link, that is sent to my email so I can login without a password, doesn't work. I press on it a few minutes late and it says that the link has expired despite the mail saying it'll be usable for 4 hours. Pls fix the logout problem and the link problem, otherwise it's quite nice."
As a whole this app is very good at being a music/podcast streaming app (i have the paid version). I don't have many of the issues that I see people commonly mention such as frequent crasking etc. However that being said there are 2 changes I would like to see that would improve the experience to a better level. 1) the quick scroll bar om the right side of the screen needs to be brought back to aid scrolling through long playlist. 2) volume needs to be increased through the app
"The app is functional, overall. There aren't that much ads but I came across something, I wanted to play my playlist and that's all I wanted but the suggested songs get in the way. I used all my skips just to atleast try to get back to my playlist and then I got stuck in a song I don't even like! I suggest adding some kind of Play Playlist Only button, because it ruins the mood when you start to listen to music that you aren't even familiar with."
Love this app. Just need to fix the queuing issue when playing daily mix and other songs that you add to queue but can't get into queue to change. üòçüòé
Pretty good app but a little too busy in its design.
I'm having a problem with the new update it's about the scroll button it doesn't work at all and doesn't tell which month the song was added the button which was earlier on the app was pretty good and helpful but the current button is just a huge waste
"Amazing! All the songs you could ever want! My only not pick is that it randomly skipps songs without me pressing the button. I have tried premium membership and it is stunning! No false advertisement and exactly what you are told you are purchasing! I do think the rules are a bit stupid, especially when it doesn't acc let u choose the songs u want to listen to and gives u like 4 ads in a row."
"Really good app design, but I have premium and can't pin more than 4 playlists. Please allow more pins, the arbitrary limit is pointless. Please add better witgets as well, so that I can get to my playlists quicker."
"It's really nice but the ads just ruin the moon, the ads suck, but over all it's all good"
"This is the best music and podcast app out there. With all of its capability. It does crash. It does freeze. It does require force free stopping, etc etc. But they are always working to try and make it better."
I generally love spotify but lately it won't let me add any songs. That button is no longer there sand i don't know why. That needs to be fixed.
Love itt!!! Resolved the issue quickly and everything is good Just 4 stars because the adds are a bit frustrating
"It was working fine on my caraudio with the build in App, but since the last Update the App is no longer working, have to use the Bluetooth connection, what sucks"
Love it but the Spotify add over and over. It's nice when I am playing my games and just want peace and quiet and music.
"Great app, the only negative is they keep messing with the UI and I think most of the changes are negative. They keep trying to make it more 'clean', but this just leeds to needing more touches to get to where you want. Also the new my library section sucks! I now have to keep clicking on my playlists rather than it just started on there!"
My only issue is the amount of clicks that are required to add songs to a specific folder. I would like to be able to search for songs for a specific folder and add them with one touch.
"Best app to use to listen to music or podcast, sometimes people make playlist that seem perfect for you. Only downside is adds and only having 6 song skips an hour but once you build a good like/love list most songs your not going to skip unless just based on a mood."
I still love the app loads but recently my shuffle button on my playlist hasn't been working. App is still amazing but that abit annoying
Great app! But those ads are ruining my mood when they pop up when I'm down listening to sad songs but I now got the premium at it is great!
"Best music service available in India as per recommendations, UI, spotify connect feature go. But still waiting for Spotify Hi-Fi."
"Autoplay needs to be fixed, please do so quickly. Additionally, please also provide .flac and such higher audio quality codecs"
"Big Problem: Defeating Shuffle Play. I like making playlists for friends. As a Premuim subscriber frustrated that I can't toggle Shuffle Play OFF. When sharing carefully DJ'd playlists to friends they naturally press the big green Play button, which automatically SHUFFLES the order of songs for them! Have to leave instructions (tedious for both) for how to play songs in the intended order. Counterintuitive! Please FIX!! OTHERWISE I LOVE SPOTIFY!!!"
I like Spotify a lot and have a paid subscription but for some reason I cannot play anything today. I click play and the button glimmers but nothing happens. It might have started last night.
"UI should be enhanced more to make the app look and feel more professional, handy, and buttery smooth"
"It's cool when I'm in the mood to listen to music üé∂ Otherwise, it's an app that I have to pay for even if I don't use it. Which is pretty lame. Companies like this don't care if you get your money's worth as long as they can squeeze you for every dime they possibly can. Otherwise, they'd design the app so that you get charged when you use it. Back when I was a teen, it wouldn't have mattered to me bc I pretty well lived on music. Now, I only listen to üé∂ while I race on my PS5."
The app is absolutely good no doubt in it but the ads are the things that ruin it that's why I'm giving 4 stars.... like I'm enjoying some aesthetic music but then an ad for a horror podcast comes so that is why I'm giving 4 stars but overall it's good app so anyone who si finding a good music app spotify is a good option but if u want a music app without ad I will not recommend this app......
"Was hesitant to use this app at first but when I realized the sheer volume of music available, I had to download it to my phone. I've had no issues with the app so far and I'm quite happy with the available music and podcasts."
"I'm having premium subscription but I feel there is two requirements as follows: 1. There should be a Equalizer setting because when we play same song on Instagram, there is a huge difference. 2. You should have SORT option like BY YEAR because we make playlist according to Singer Wise & if we want to listen 2002-05 songs of different albums in our playlist, we can't adjust the songs by year wise it was released. Please help us solving in this two issues especially the YEAR WISE SORT FEATURE."
"I have a big problem with this app, after Android 12 (miui 13) update, Playlist shortcut not work at all. Please fix it"
There is a problem in my laptop version because sometime I get a small parallel button before minimising or closing time. Please do check and rectify.
It's really good and I would recomend to others but I really wish it didn't add things to my playlist because the majority of the time it absolutely sucks and ruins the mood :( I have a Disney playlist BC Disney is life yk and it recommend ACDC which is no where near the vibe I wanted and I couldn't get rid of it BC it had already recommend really bad songs I skipped before that Also they have added way more adds now and the majority of them are unskipable so unless you can pay than don't get it
I have been using spotify for 3months its very good. But the only problem is the Previous and the Next buttons we cant be getting 6 skips per hour please work on that. Otherwise download this app has all the music you want thank you
I really like this app it is really good for music on the move and discovering new music to love however unless you have premium (which is quite pricey) you are bombarded with adds with spoil your groove.
"Premium subscriber here,my experience with spotify has been good except for being a bit laggy sometimes.However,after the update the song just suddenly stops and when I play it again it goes back to the beginning. It's vv annoying and ruins my listening experience"
"Please, add forward and previous song buttons in the bottom notification within the app"
"Overall a Great App, confused why only the Mobile Version requires Premium to Operate to its Fullest. I am only bumping this to 4 Stars for 2 Reasons. 1. It Plays Suggested Songs in the 'Liked Songs' Playlist. It Counteracts the Point of it Being a Liked Songs Playlist. 2. The Filters for The Liked Songs Playlist has recently stopped working for me. I will select 'Pop' or 'Musicals' and it'll just generally play my Liked Playlist. Ive tried to Log out and Uninstall it. Nothing works to fix it."
"Love the application. A built in EQ would be really great. My only complaint is about the update: I can't see the ""What's New"" Section here. No change log on the page at all. I am always hesitant to update any software without first reading the log. Please provide the ""Whats New"" or simply link the changelog for us. Thanks guys!"
Excellent app that provide good recommendations but do come with irritating ads.Well desinged interface and user experience.
"Really good most of time. Didn't like the adverts or restrictions on the free service so paid for 'premium"" which in my opinion is far better and worth the monthly subscription. I like how intuitive Spotify is for recommending similar songs to my playlists. Occasionally (the reason for only 4 stars) the app freezes on my phone and the only way to get it working again is by unistalling and reinstalling. If Spotify could sort out this little glitch I would give it 5 stats."
Over-all fun to use but please either put an option to edit the default favorites playlist or stop making the add favorite icon (green heart) too close to the pause/play button. As an exclusive user of my favorites list I'm tired of accidentally removing songs from months ago and adding them on an order I don't like
"STOP GIVING ME THE PERIOD PADS ADS IT JUST RUINS THE MOOD I CAN'T EVEN LISTEN TO MUSIC WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED BY AN ADVERTISEMENT, it's not helping anyone, it's just annoying at this point. But overall it's really great and I recommend it if you have the money to buy Premium :)"
"The locking up problem is, I'm praying gone. Also closing apps and dumping me back in my homepage while I'm typing. I think my music selection sometimes was too quick for the app. I have slowed it down. Ok for now. Also love how EASY to send out problems to Spotify. That's a great thing."
"It's a good music app just not as effective at recommending music. I used to listen with Pandora which despite having a smaller library, recommended music better suited to my taste. I found more music I loved that way. Hope algorithm gets better."
why did you remove the share lyrics button from my Spotify:( i need it back please return it for 5 stars!
Good experience. Less ads required.
It's fantastic!!!!!!! Omgg ik this isn't BECAUSE of this app but music is one of my therapy. This is also the reason why I took out one star. Music is one of my therapy and ads are constantly ruining the therapy mood. But this app is fire and the lite version is more.
It was quite nice just that not alot of options for songs **some that I like are not there
Switched to YouTube Music after Spotify was in the news recently over bad press. Best choice I've made in years as I discovered that it is more suited to my needs. Spotify is still a great service but YT music premium is half the price. $5 vs $10 per month. I recommend trying out this app and also testing out other platforms to see what fits for you. Spotifys free service is hard to beat. If you are looking for a premium subscription I recommend checking out YT music.
"It's a very good app, the ready-made playlist by Spotify is all good songs recomendations. But right now I have been seeing some features of my friends on Spotify that I don't have in my Spotify, just like the 'share' button on the lyrics."
App is very easy to maneuver. Just wish the app would learn my music taste quicker. But otherwise the songs I do fine are easy to add into playlists.
"It's a really good app. I probably use Spotify every single day, though I only give 4 stars because I really would like the same features that are on computer, to be the same for mobile. I don't think it's quite fair, but I believe it'll get there one day."
"Good app that I've had since it was launched, and can't complain that they have held the same ¬£9.99 since it started, there's no way I could ever build such a huge diverse music collection by spending the same on downloads. If I could set songs I have downloaded to use off-line as ringtone, it would get 5 stars. I don't really like the current versions layout of 'My library'..... but I can live with these small frustrations."
Great UI but needs some major performance/stability improvements ASAP!!!!
"I love being able to listen to my favourite songs, however sometimes Spotify likes to add its own songs to your playlist. It can be quite annoying!! Overall I love this app and would definitely recommend it to others! :)"
"Update: I have to say, support was spot on. They answered and solved my problem immediately. So I'm giving back 2 stars. If you have a premium account, though, pay exactly on time. But if there is a free option for this app, why do I have to be locked out of my account if a payment is late? Also, a lot of people seem to be having problems. The apps can't keep up with the newer phones because they're all different and designed to do what you needed an app for. Oh well. Onward and upward."
why cant the feature that allows you to see what ur friends are currently listening to be on mobile and not just pc? i think my experience would be boosted like 80% more. Its such a pity. YES spotify should in a way be a socmed app. idc if it ruins my mental health and makes me more self conscious of what others think of me. as if i could ever get enough of that. this feature would be a game changer IM TELLING YOU.
It was a very good app and still is but now when i try to open the app its says that 'your offline' and it's been quite a few days so please try to get more updates and try to fix it
"Generally solid, use it a lot more than I thought I would when I bought it. Recently though the UI has bugged out a few times, the song will keep playing without any control panel coming up or option to go to the song playing screen. Usually fixed by closing and reopening the app, annoying but not a major issue."
"Still waiting for an ""add to playlist"" button on the player rather than being hidden in a menu. Difficult to organize songs because of this."
Love this app but one thing I would add. Where you click button that would listen to the music and tell you what it is.
"Working well now The only improvement suggestion would be an option for a bigger widget than 1x4, then you could fit in buttons to turn random on/off, and maybe a drop down list of saved playlists etc. The widget just seems small and basic at the moment compared to widgets for mp3 players."
"I love Spotify. It has a premium plan designed for families so up to 6 people can have premium access. That's what I currently use and I love it! With premium you get unlimited access to music ad-free. You can queue songs and create playlists very easily. The only thing I don't like is the price. Without Premium, you get disruptive ads and limited song skips per hour, so it's a ""money vs value"" situation. If premium is too much for you be prepared for what I mentioned or just don't get this app."
I am having so much fun with this app! It is very intuitive in what I like.
Ads are quite annoying but everything else is good
"This app is amazing, but it drains your battery extremely quickly and you have to pay to listen offline. Also please stop adding songs into my playlist. I just want to listen to the songs I added"
I'm giving 4 stars because of everything. And 1 star less because Spotify needs to get a streamlined interface on Android. It should provide better viewing experience by improving the UI of the application in terms of alignment to Android 10 and later versions. It should be improved from the upper as well lower hands of the application as it looks separate from OS and not streamlined. Also it should be more smooth at some points in the app.
"Spotify is/has become the prime location for listening to music these days. The i tuitive UI, the range of music, the relatively inexpensive cost all form a good, cohesive experience. The one time I experienced a bug, the debelopers and support tram were quick to respond to my ticket. My only two complaints are: *Inability to switch off pop up ads, even if I already have premium *The diversity of music when it comes to remixes is a bit lacklustre (though this is to a degree not Spotifys fault)"
"I'm a premium subscriber. The daily playlist is good and the recommendation engine is better than Google's (I also have paid YouTube music). If I stop listening on one device it will pick up where it left off if I resume on a second device which is important for podcasts. Sometimes it is playing audio, but in the UI it doesn't show any audio playing and the only way to get it to stop is to force quit. Not often but once is more than enough. If they fix that it will be a five star app."
"I can't use the lyrics sharing feature? I have deleted and installed the application many times, updated it, logged out of the account and logged in again, but it still does not have the ability to share lyrics. There is a place to share lyrics but there is no share button. That's why I took a star off. I hope officials answer this."
"Hi, I'm old Spotify user and I genuinely love this app. They provide you best quality addvertisements and they sometimes roast themselves so if you're having a breakdown at 2:34am listening to your fav song, they're just gonna roast themselves and make you laugh. Sometimes it's annoying when songs comes in between when I vibe on adds at my terrace but it's manageable. I thought about purchasing Spotify premium but I bought apple music cause it feels illegal to buy Spotify premium as a brown guy"
"Everything in this app is good in fact I love it but the one thing that make me hate it is ads Really, I know that ads can't be removed but it can be of less seconds and shown less so that we can enjoy the song . But the ads appear quickly one after other and they are of very seconds I mean really please please resuce the time of appearing an ad and also its seconds. Please it will be really helpful if you will make it . Thank You"
"Everything is good, hence this is the most famous and the most downloaded music app but the problem is the ads they show numerous ads to only take thier premuim lots of ads are there...üòÖ"
"For the most part it works alright, except a little bit of slowdown on my phone, and a weird bug where no matter what set of headphones I use, the left speaker is much quieter than the right speaker."
"been using the app for quite a while now and I'm absolutely in love with it because of a lot of great features, and customised playlists. But a recent problem I've been facing is with Spotify canvas. There's no option to turn it on. I've tried reinstalling as well but of no use which left me quite disappointed. But overall, love the app"
It is a good app For free music. Though I would like them to improve their UI a bit more.
I love the ability to create my own playlists and finding some obscure songs in the process. I also like the fact that while building your list they will offer suggestions for your list that may help you find some new music.
"Great music but some changes needed. Blocking a song that's far too easy, just under add to my list. So sometimes you accidentally hit the wrong button and the song ends up gone forever."
To be honest i love this app I would use it more if there was a way to quickly set up a long play list because youtube music I use more because it was set up before this. BTW love ‚ù§ üòç üíñ the way the music plays when I am on different apps and the lyrics don't get me started.
Please fix the widget. Spotify is brilliant but the android widget doesn't function like other like wise app widgets. Other apps the last thing played will remain on the widget for ever ready to be played at the the press of the play button. But Spotify widget will go blank after a small period of time and then is just another button to open the app in order to get the last thing played. Please fix this you will shave milliseconds off my day üòÇ üòÇ
I like the minimal & simple UI. It enhances the overall experienceüëåüèª. But in the free version of the app the repeated ads are just annoying ü•¥üòêüòÖ.
Overall experience is quite good. Doesn't shows much ads. Song recommendations are good.

I am so grateful for this app and its service but it would be SO MUCH BETTER if you could add a song to multiple playlists at once not just one at a time that's super annoying and seems obvious UI to me so PLEASE add this simple feature then 5 million stars!!!
It's great only if paid...apple music can be cheaper than this...but app experience and UI is so much better...but would hope to have more control over audio quality/ bitrate
I love this app but I'm having problems with one of the newer updates. They finally added the lyrics feature to almost all songs but I have yet to see it work on any of the songs that claim they have lyrics available. I have checked all guides and nothing seems to be working... Just a tad dissapointed.
I wish I could listen to music without the internet... it doesn't give a lot of hints either when your looking for new artists or songs. But it's super quick in finding exactly the song I'm looking for. A plus.
So far past month been using it and comparing with Apple music. It's not bad... I like how it connects with my alexa and car. The UX feel is good and able to navigate around fine. I do like how I can switch devices to play music which is convenient.
"Overall, the app is good. Gives good recommendations, and doesn't have so many ads. However, the premium individual plan is too expensive. Instead, we can buy Amazon Prime, JioSaavn or other apps which are cheaper. The app also doesn't allow to share lyrics with a share button using default Android's share feature. The app only had support to share lyrics in apps like WhatsApp, Instagram etc. It should also have support for Signal Messanger."
Add equilizer like MX player. Sound Equilizer is in setting it might be in music dashboard to use it easily.
Would definitely recommend üëå it is a very good music platform the only problem is that it doesn't have all the songs you look for it might not have some covers or clean versions other than that I was quite happy with it
"i like spotify alot but it looks different and i dont have the button to see the lyrics or have the album cover on the screen while on other webites (im on computer) but when i log into my other account its the same with all the stuff that i dont have and i know its because of an update but i really liked those features and now their gone, ALSO it keeps switching to toehr playlist while im listening like the playlist based on the one that im listening to and its kinda annoying and it plays the s"
"Ads are quite intrusive . Sometimes after watching a 30 second ad , when I shouldn't have to see another ad for half an hour , I get another ad after a few minutes, which should not be the case. The Equalizer should be made available in a more easily accessible menu instead of the settings , as I have to go back to the app home page, go to settings , scroll down and then click on the Equalizer option to access it , which is quite cumbersome and unnecessary ."
"Being the ubiquitous music listening experience of today it's a given that it works pretty well, but recently I'm having problems with it playing what I actually want. The other day I wanted to switch from an album to the next, and after every song it went back to the previous one. Just today, I couldn't play the first song of my daily mix. I'd guess there are tests for at least this functionality.. also, where's Spotify hifi still?"
"Like Spotify under Family plan, also love the UI interface but the audio quality is bad specially for rock/heavy metal music, after 4 years using Spotify, I finally switched to YouTube Music and the quality audio is amazing, specially on the car."
"This App doesn't songs from most of my favorite bands e.g. Linkin Park, Avenged Sevenfold and most of the Rock bands . Also it doesn't have all the Indian regional songs. Btw the User Interface is quite great but my only concern is the inadequate collection of songs. I expect Spotify to expand there collection if they want to succeed in the Indian Market. Thank you."
Simple and inviting! Nothing counter intuitive to confuse anyone who needs a music platform. For gen x and before the idea of the latest interfaces is intimidating at the very least. You've exceeded greatly though simplicity and by adding nothing superfluous. Thanks.
App is quite amazing. One thing that I pick other apps over Spotify e.g YT music is the amount of music it contains that you can't find anywhere in Spotify. Over all great app tho
"Spotify is by far the best music streaming app I have ever used. From the simplicity and easy to use UI to a whole array of all the music you need tailored to fit you perfectly. The algorithms suggestions for new music are splendid and bring you closer to new music. All in all, 9/10 app. 9 coz i am certain there is a lot more to come as they work up to 10"
"It's a convenient service, but the app has some very frustrating issues. Some things are very slow to load, as if it's a connection issue (sometimes when trying to open an options menu it tells me to go online, despite my being very much online already), but this is quite persistent and no other apps have a connection problem. There's no reason why seeing my own downloads or opening a menu to set a sleep timer should even need a connection in the first place"
"A world of amazing music across the decades at my fingertips, only thing that worries me is how little payment the artistes recieve. Guilty conscience is the only thing that looses the app one star from me."
Everything is fine but Equilizer option should near player options but it is in the settings. We need to follow very long path just to enable equilizer. I think that is only wrost part of this app.
"On my previous phone (iphone) the UI was way smother. A lot of seamless swipes instead of abrupt buttons to close pages etc. I just wish that the Android version will have some UI changes and smoother experience, just like the iOS one. Another example is are the way the (album) colors & the color around the album cover when playing an album are treated on Android, kinda muted and less ""poppy"" compared to iOS."
Good app however there are some problems when I'm skipping through a song it sometimes doesn't skip to that part and I have to try again it isn't that major but still quite annoying I know it isn't cause my WiFi is slow since its 500mbps
UI could be more organized & intuitive. Otherwise not bad. But if I'm paying I expect MORE. Like never having to deal with seeing the wrong title playing at the bottom & staying stuck like that for hours! Also sudden stops for no reason! (Îàà‚Ä∏Îàà)
"I would put five stars, and I have had this app for quite a while and I haven't had a problem until TODAY. My music keeps cutting out in the middle of the songs. So can I hear a solution soon please, so I can fix this problem? Or is there going to be an update soon?"
"Good app with heaps of good features but its not quite perfect. Often the app double downloads albums in my library so I have manually remove them, it freezes often enough to get irritating on all devices I have and I sometimes have to reinstall the app because of random glitches. When those issues ain't happening spotify is great but they do."
Its very good its just that you guys removed the feature were we can see the songs and now we can only see the names and I hate how the shuffle button is with like the play button I am not saying it's bad but I would like it to be back it's fine if not since it's not that big of a Problem
"After a update some time ago, the buttons on the notification are always black even when the song has black background. It's annoying but not deal breaking. The other issue is when I change songs on another device with my phone, the song changes but on the phone it gets stuck on timestamp 0.01 and the buttons to change songs stop working. Then I have to go back and forth between the main menu and song display to change them. Other than that it works."
"Experience is good. Good UI, only problem is, if you're not on an auto-renewal subscription, when it ends, all the downloaded songs get deleted even after you subscribe again."
"Very good overall, never had any major problems. couple of minor issues like songs (very rarely) continuing in silence after they finish, but that could just be a glitch caused by my bad internet lol"
UX could be improved a bit - I don't wanna wait one second every time I click on the 3-dots icon for the song options. Spotify checks for an active internet connection just to grey out some options from that menu and it ruins the experience. AND THIS HAPPENS EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE OFFLINE MODE ENABLED!
"For some reason while I have updated the app, I still don't have the ""share"" button to post lyrics. And this is on my account only because when I log onto other accounts, the ""share"" button is available."
Great app but songs of different languages should have English lyrics. And it has so many ads it's really annoying and it ruins mood .
"Great sound quality, easy to make playlists, wear os app is also nice but it requires being connected to phones spotify. Though premium is pretty much required, and some smaller artists I can find on soundcloud/youtube/bandcamp aren't available on spotify, but most of what I listen is available. Trying with a trial of premium atm, considering starting to pay for it mainly because the sound quality is way better than other apps I use. Btw you need to set quality in settings for best quality."
"This app is amazing, ƒ∞ always listen to music from here. However the adverts are irritating, ƒ∞t is about alcohol and other things that are totally not suitable for me. It also says says ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" but literally ten minutes later I see two adverts."
"It pauses itself in between songs until I turn my screen on or press the button, been happening for over a week now and never happened before. BUG."
"Since the last update, it's been quite glitchy. The screen won't show what current song/podcast is playing, it will show the last one I was listening to. At times it would also stop playing when my screen would go black. Other than that I love Spotify."
"Everything about this app is brilliant! I only have one complaint. I experience it quite annoying, now with the new ""enhance"" function that I have to find the song in my playlist to delete it, rather then just simply be able to delete the song through the ""play"" window."
"The app is pretty good only when you have premium, because as child I couldn't pay to get premium so instead I just had to deal with two ads that would be 1 minute long and if you're lucky 30 seconds which I wouldn'tmind if they weren'tso frequent, something else is that you can't actually choosewhat songs you can play since you'reonly option is the shuffle button. I would only recommend if you're willing to pay for premium."
Best app for songs and the most thing I loved in Spotify is its UI its is very easy and so nice üòç but the only one negative is its playing often the ads if we play one song also it will play first ads and next only it will play the song and after two songs played it will ads again....üòë Spotify please reduce ur ads
"App keeps stucking. It lags since 1 month while music keeps playing in the background. EDIT- Above lagging problem is solved now. But the app keeps leaving network condition by its own. Please check this issue. My phone's new and network operator is also quite good. Then, i will consider for 4 or 5 stars as well."
"i really really love this app, especially the 1 week premium fiture. spotify rarely crash in my devices, and oh god their costumer service are very kind and take the responsibilty so quickly, they help me solve my problem in just a night. keep it up! and lastly i hope spotify can make something like customizable Home Screen so it can be more comfortable and fun to use."
"I love Spotify so much, but sometimes it says its offline when my Internet is working fine. I would also prefer when you click on the 3 dots next to a song to see more options (like add to playlist or queue) that once I'm done it doesn't automatically close that window as often I want to add the song to multiple playlists without having to click too many times üòÖ. Adding a back button from this screen would be helpful!!"
Unmatched streaming and recommendations. Quick downloads and recently played music plays uninterrupted even on listing internet. The voice command feature Hey Spotify does not work.
"Music keeps playing over phone calls. The lock screen function buttons sometimes disappear. The app thinks I'm offline and refuses to search, even when i am not. Browsing through the app is not straight forward, and it requires a long time to load pages - this is not a limitation of my phone."
"It's good for a free user. However, the ads are a little too much and quite long. Consider making it 2 ads at once instead of 3 long ones at once"
"I love this app, i can listen music what i want without downloading (im not using premium), but... the problem is i dont like it because there a Advertisement its ruin my mood, but i still love it this app its makes me heal,happy and enjoy listening music and podcast and that's it thanks you Sorry if you don't understand and it's not clear (‚úø ‚ô°‚Äø‚ô°)"
"I find this app usefull but it is quite annoying when random ""suggested songs"" are added into your playlist. I think there should be an option to allow suggested songs or not. Overall, the app is very easy to use."
"Do something about the latest update, it's killing any love I had for this app. I get the wrong song displayed on my lock screen and widgets and when I hit skip, it'll jump back a few songs and ruin the queue! I use spotify connect through the echo dot and it worked great for ages, but I'm honestly close to cancelling my subscription and going elsewhere at this point, I'd rather have to change CD's after every album than have to go to the app and find the song I was up to when it cut me off."
"This is a musical garden of eden. My ears have never experienced such serotonin. While the app is quite greedy it is fine due to the amazing sounds it produces. Not only does it have awestriking albums and songs, it also has amazing podcasts of which i like to listen to. It is like rain but if it where speaking beautiful words in your ear. I almost want to cry when i listen to my playlist pepe popo. The. Podcasts are not just funny or people taking their thoughts on controversy,yet also stories"
Hie do you even reorder playlists in 2021 now? Are we regressing in terms of UX? Why is there no song multiselect? Please look at all the features audio players of early 2010s provided.
Overall nice app üëç with no lag. Please put button 'Remove song' 'Remove playlist' and 'Remove podcast' again in the recently played section of Spotify app on both platforms Android and PC.
"Lately the app on both Win and Android is very laggy and slow, full of bugs and interruptions, songs are jamming, play button won't do nothing for minutes although the internet connection is good; while songs are being downloaded by the app the wifi connection in the phone and sometimes the app too are unusable. Also the correlation between desktop and phone app is a mess lately, the play controls disappears completely on the phone while listening on the pc etc. Once a light app, not anymore"
"It's a good a app for streaming songs but, after every two songs, it starts showing unskipable ads and it seriously ruins the mood. Please reduce the amount of ads you show, Spotify."
"For listening to music, I don't go beyond Spotify. On of the best in buisness. It has some flaws like- lyrics don't show when I bought premium, idk why? But overall the best app for both music and podcast too. And its premium is worth it... üåüüåü Spotify team, continue to improve... Love your app."
"Nice, but many songs are not available yet üòï, please add them ASAP and make some UI changes in the app, it fellas like old days app. Otherwise I've nothing to say about this application. Hope app developers will work on it soon."
"It is a exquisite app, but the ads are unbearable. Would like to have limited ads to keep the music going on, and on. However, mobile version of spotify needs updating; you cant click any songs and it plays, it plays it in shuffle on mobile. Overall, it is a great app."
"The only problem I have is that sometimes music I don't want on my playlist are played. If I build a playlist, just play the music on the list. Forcing music I don't like or don't want is really annoying"
"While my telephone is on dark mode, i have some problems with Spotify. For example, stop-start button doesn't work correctly, i can't see whether the music open or not. And also, all of the albums, except for black ones, seem black. I can't see their exact colour. I like Spotify but it would be better if there weren't these problems."
"I really like Spotify, but I don't really like the layout of it, if I change my music preferences, I can't just click a button in the app. Or like how I in other music apps I could just block an artist or a genre"
"Free version: Shuffle playing was quite ok for a free user but the fact featured ads are misleading deserves a downgrade of one star ‚Äî talking about the mini plan nor free 1 or 3-month premium but payment via mobile isn't available. Nevertheless, I just wanted to experience it. Even asked for help but didn't resolve either. Maybe some time if I had my credit. Best experience so far even with a free account"
"A friendly reminder: it would be quite great if Spotify had a toggle mode for regional music. For instance, if I live in Russia it doesn't really mean I want to see only Russian music and podcasts. Moreover, I don't want to see them due to some personal preferences."
"Wish there was a quicker way to add songs to playlists. Also, wish it was easier to manage podcasts. Still the best music service though."
"This is a great app I love it, it's easy to use and it has the songs I love to listen to ‚ò∫Ô∏èthe only problem it has it the shuttle and repeat button keeps going away and that's so annoying üôÑ I wish they would fix it other then that the app is great üòÜ 10/10 would recommend"
"Hurrah! They've changed the 'Play' button back to normal after the experiment with making 'shuffle' its default action, with no option to change it, in spite of the many genres and the spoken word content that need to be heard in order, and in spite of the thought & care that go into album programming. Spotify is once again a very decent music app, attached to one of the best music libraries around, making the sub terrific value. I like the facility to 'cast' music to Chromecast, which I expect I will love once the software allows Chromecast to respect the Autoplay setting on the controlling app."
Definitely my most used app. I love how you can add your own artwork to playlists and put them in folders. Love Spotify üñ§. Only thing I would add is a play button on folders for mobile users so we can shuffle multiple playlists from the phone app. Currently the only way to do this is through the desktop version.
"Spotify is the worst first person shooter game, blogging platform, live video stream and Pok√©mon app I have ever used but as a repository for music and a music player... It's intuitive and useful. I do wish they'd pay their artists more. That would be the difference for me between a 4 and 5 is a truly just version of the app."
"I have great experience with spotify, although the problem being random pauses. It's annoying especially since it ruins my vibe. Hope this gets a fix."
"Since the last updated you added a ton of bugs. While casting on another device the screen just freezes and it's saying that is not playing anything, although it is and when it says is playing just keeps getting stuck to the first song of the playlist to 0:00, it's very frustrating. I've recently acquired the premium membership since I didn't liked the usability when you first launched, I sticked with YouTube music but as I said until last updated since I got premium I actually enjoyed it."
"App works as intended now, however still no hifi support which is rather disappointing considering apple added it out of the blue without any promises before hand. Now Spotify is the only service without even CD quality audio steaming. Still the best in terms of experience from a ui perspective and for discovering new music and recommendations"
"I have used Spotify since they required an invitation (yes, you used to need an invitation)! I love it love it love it. I do wish certain suggestions would be considered (adding BPM, making private listening default, etc) but otherwise love it."
"Found a bug, may be caused by the old phone of mine, but anyway. Blackview BV7000, when i get to second ""stories"" (sometimes earlier) from ""wrapped"" Spotify just stops. The app is quite cool though"
App is just wonderful ... But I would like to suggest improvement that need immediate action. Lyrics feature for both android and fire tv versions requires improvement.
"I love Spotify it's design, it's organization, it's content, podcasts, artists, playlists, etc reason only 4 stars sometimes ads are a bit much, I like the ""watch this video and get 1/2 hr ad free"" 2 15 second commercials ever 15 minute would also be ok"
"Everything is great, but I don't like that the poadcasts switch episodes when u swipe. Make some lock button also a seach bar to seach episodes. Thanks"
"I've been using this for a few days, I love it. It plays with the screen off, it has all the songs I want and everything. I do recommend a button where you can shuffle your playlist, I haven't seen one, but it might be on premium or something idk but I don't like listening to the same things in the same order Everytime."
"Dear Spotify team, there are some Spotify UI issue happening in Xiaomi smartphone.... 1. Play and pause button become complete white 2. During play the time indication not sync with song And some little bugs..."
"I absolutely love this app. I enjoy quite a lot using it by listening my favorite songs and artists BUT I don't understand why the lyrics doesn't appear on my screen, there's no even the option and I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but I'd like to have them as any other person, so that's why I'm giving you 4 stars until this issue is solved."
"Been with Spotify for years and the app has gotten better. But I don't understand why Spotify changed the way ""Your Library"" loads. It was perfect the way it was before.... Now I have to add a filter just to see my playlists. Extremely counterintuitive."
"I dont like the fact that Spotify in the African region, at least Kenya, strips off some functionality. Like the Canvas and Lyrics in the paid version . That really sucks Spotify.... Also quite buggy in how the app connects to the internet even in very stable connections Other than those two qualms, I absolutely love the app"
"Wish there were more options to have the system build a playlist around automatically. But the overall experience is great, as you would expect."
"I don't have much problems with Spotify but this one thing just bothers me a lot: playing suggested songs at the end of a playlist, whenevever it starts to play the suggested song I can't replay the playlist, I tried clucking the shuffle button but it always brings me back to that song. At least just add a ""replay playlist"" Button or just don't play suggested songs at the end of the playlists at all."
Spotify is quite good and very nice to use. But sometimes it will be very slow and have a poor load time. And I personally don't like how you have to pay just to listen to music.
"Great app, the algorythm creates very good playlists to discover new songs. BUT I can't get rid of a certain genre I stopped listening to years ago. Would be nice if there was an option to prevent certain genres or languages from beein displayed or at least keep them out of the playlists with recommended songs. Also would be nice if there was something like incognito/friends mode where it doesn't effect the recommended music. Always ruins the algorythm if a friend plays music on your phone xD"
"I love Spotify, especially for it's remote control function and it's design, but new version..you know, lyrics is actually the most useful feature you could add, but lyrics design is totally awful... doesnt look like it's made by Spotify at all. guess it will be fixed in few updates, but still.. it could be better if the background was darker, maybe with some kinda pattern that comes from cover of a song, like in a***e music"
"Well,well,well,I gotta say I quite like this music thing but I doesn't have clean versions for every inappropriate songs,I like ""don't be shy""by t√Øesto and KAROL G and there is no clean version of that,if you please could change I will give this app 5 stars"
Like a lot. Now listen to music here rather than what was stored on my phone. A quicker way of accessing full albums is needed though.
"The ads get stacked, however so then does the music. It's frustrating that the 'back' button isn't funcional."
"Helpful platform rich content. Will be nicer if the ""previous track"" button is functional when listening to music."
"I love the app so much, but I would give it a 5 star when it works on its queuing. I should be able to queue two albums and shuffle the songs between those albums queued. The only way I can play two albums together and also be able to shuffle between the two would be to create a playlist, and that's very stressful"
Just recently this app has started to freeze every 3rd or 4th song and I have to touch the play button to restart the song ALSO the car mode is no longer there meaning that while playing music in a vehicle means you have to wake up the phone when you want to skip a song
"Spotify has always been my fav music app. Previously, i would have given it 5 stars but after i switch my phone from iOS to Android, there has been a slight prob. My phone will show Spotify still playing music even after i turned it off. Its really annoying to see that i cant stop it and i had to delete the app. After deleting, for quiet some time nothing else happened. But now it will show spotify trying to play. Not sure if it is my phone's prob or its a bug. But spotify us still cool B)."
"Okay so I genuinely love Spotify, but since it updated last my songs have been glitchy and today half of them wouldn't play or would stop a few seconds into the song. I uninstalled it and tried logging in but it's just saying my internet connection is poor, it's not my wifi at all though. I can't log back in at all. Please update and fix this"
"Waiting for a light mode since I'm squinting to see my screen in the daylight. So many options are tucked away so I couldn't get to them immediately. Like private session; so the app wouldn't think I'm suddenly into another artist/genre when I just wanna check it out one time. And the main screen is always changing, kinda confusing."
Spotify works really well and is very has a helpful way of going back on to change the song but yes it does start off buggy by closing the app and having you go back in but afterwards it works smoothly and is gonna have a quick run start
"I live for music and i afore this app. Therefore, I had the indie pop mood filter in my liked songs for one day and I absolutely loved it. After that day, I never saw it again and Im impatiently waiting for this mood to come back. I hope to get a quick feedback and I demand you to put it back."
"LOVE spotify premium, well worth the money. I only have one gripe, regarding the latest update. The latest update took away a good widget, and left only one widget behind- and that widget SUCKS!! The buttons are too small and close together, and don't auto-resize after you enlarge the widget. Please fix the widget, the current one is terrible!"
"A great app but has limitations. Amazing amount of music available instantly, ability to connect to devices such as PS4 and smart TV is great. However, offline mode is very slow (or doesn't work) and still tries to connect to the Internet when it's enabled and you're playing downloaded songs. Often new updates to the UI feel poorly thought out and like a step backwards in usability."
I like Spotify a lot but why did you replace the wiget:((( I liked when you still had the option to use the old one. The album art is way too small on this new wiget and the play buttons take up way to much room.
Thankfully podcasts are now available in the Middle East. The UI needs a little bit of improvements with easy seperation between podcasts and songs.
"From a design perspective, it's not overwhelming and its feature shines on it's own and easy to remember. It easy to listen to my favorite artist with a streamlined interface and be able to save my songs in an organizational manner. Good content and always engaging! 4.5/5"
I switched over from Pandora a while back because I couldn't save anything onto the sd card. The automatic playlist creation isn't quite as good in that regard but every other aspect of Spotify is better. Just have to go in knowing about what you want to hear.
"I love how it quickly connects. But I dislike that it drains my battery so fast even when I close all my apps it remains on my desktop, so I have to keep logging on and off and having to enter my password each time to avoid battery drainage."
Best music streaming app in the market. The music quality is good and their music recommendations are just frickin awesome. Their app UI is the best(no competition in that segment) and easy to use. Their music library is up to date. But too many ads in free version makes it quite annoying tbh. The premium version of it is too good and worth the money. Overall best app in the segment.
"Quite good, not perfect but the redeeming factor over youtube music would have to be that you dont have to pay to play music with your screen off or on other windows. Would recommend."
"Overall, I would still rate this app at #2 or #3 as my all time favorite. Primarily due to the UI. I just have never liked it when compared to Rhapsody's (now Napster). Pandora and Spotify are about equal imo. Pandora still has the better long-term retention of playlists, with mine dating before the housing collapse 2008-9."
"Recently my Spotify has been acting up. It's becoming quite slow to my movements and if I've played a different playlist before I play another one the song from my first playlist will stop but it will be the only song that shows. If I try to skip it, it will just skip to the next song from the second playlist I've chosen. Spotify please fix this. (I've updated to its most recent so that's not the issue )"
The best application for music but the drawback was the ads it was quite annoying while listening on a game so i bought vip thing. It was the best if ads reduces. Anyway i love it.
While the dark mode on mobile the play pause button is not visible. It is very uneasy. Please fix this. Other than that everything is superb
"So, ive been using spotify for more than a yar and i have to say its a pretty decent app for music. The ads are announg if youre using free version of it, but once you buy prerium wich gives you 1 month for free (i got 3 months for free because im using a samsung device) it really changes everything. I would give it 5 starts of not those annoyng ads that can really ruin yours ecperience with the app."
"Been using since 2015. Overall the experience is pretty good. However, would like to see some quirks ironed out, i.e the shuffle sometimes plays same songs over and over in a playlist and I have to manually select other songs to make it play the whole playlist. Bit of an inconvenience on road/during work."
Lyrics. Lyrics. Lyrics. It would be better if there was a button to see the lyrics. I keep skuiling when I wanna check if the song has lyrics and it's quite inconvenient
Overall very good but randomly there are podcasts showing which I have never listened to.. it stays on the home page forever.... Might require some updates but the music and quality is good. üåºüíú
"Maybe I just need to get used to using this app because compared to others that I have used, it's not very user friendly. Hopefully I will get it figured out because I don't want to continue to pay for something that I have difficulty navigating. **The song and artist selection is quite awesome tho! üéµüé∂üé∏üé§üéßüéöÔ∏èüìª"
"Worked great on Android until a recent update (Spotify or Android) in the last 4 months. If opened on Wifi, crashes UI, freezes phone and requires a hard reboot to make phone useable again."
Could have a better interface for last listened songs. Grouping and searching could more intuitive. Could offer international radio. However is still the best music app. Reviewed 19 October 2021 Obviously they listen to their subscribers üòã You can now see your 'last listened music.' I love the suggestions and it can make your discover more artists and music you would love. My next suggestion is to make the interface even more intuitive by offering to save songs and artist in specific playlist.
"Although it functions well and nice as we've subscribed to it, the design could get some improvements‚Äî especially the lyrics and the background."
"Used to be great but since some weeks started pausing songs several times, even the downloaded ones. Already updated and still happens quite often. Online and offline."
The playlists you can make are on point. Quite a few ads on the free version but they gotta make money somehow. But also don't lie and say this is the only ad for 30 minutes and then break your promise and hit me with 3 back to back. Better than Pandora üòÑ
I loved Spotify until the latest update. Now I can't use the shuffle button or play a different song. All it does is play a preview. But I'm willing to continue using it because it is a great app
There are a lot of ads wich make it hard to enjoy my favorite song. But there are lyrics and almost all the songs are available so it is quite nice.
"Ok Spotify fixed my issues, but here's some quick advice for those that don't pay. Hide songs and artist in playlists, it's pretty easy and saves you skips."
"I love the overall UI and recommendations of the app. But there needs tp be two separate tabs for my own created playlists and the playlists I have liked. Otherwise, it becomes difficult to find my own playlists amidst the sea of playlists I have liked. Also, we should be able to make our own play queues without having to make a playlist and we should be able to rearrange the whole queue not just the ones coming after the song which is being played. I hope you do something about these issues."
Used Tidal and YouTube Music. Spotify still has the best UI and it has certain songs that even YouTube Music doesn't have. 1 bad note is that the equaliser in the settings tab is missing after updating.
"I think it's a great app for streaming. Spotify suggested songs that suits my preference and vibe. The premium is great and yeah no ads. For broke person like me, premium for one day is a best option with low cost."
"All is well with the app, but I'm actually quite disappointed with the latest update as due to that only I guess I'm unable to find the equaliser setting, or I think it actually has disappeared :(( please do look into it. üôÅ It was my favourite feature in Spotifyüò¢"
I love everything about the way it's set up and the simplicity of the app. The only thing I don't like is the algorithm that picks similar music to yours. Quite often it's way out of the wheelhouse. Other then that its beautiful!
"Convenient, sound quality is great, love downloading music/pods to listen to off grid. Update: While I still use the app daily the new update to the library is absolutely awful! Makes navigating your downloaded episodes/albums much more difficult! Thanks! Update 2: Please fix the UI!!! Finding podcast downloads is a complicated mess, it used to be so easy and somehow you've screwed it all up! This is still a great service overall but navigation has become needlessly annoying!"
"I like the overal design of the app, the only thing I would to add is a function which puts albums/songs to a list that you want to listen to later. So maybe make a function called ""listen later"""
"Great app with smooth UI. But, way too many adds that destroy the listening experience. Got premium to get rid of those annoying adds."
"Would be better if there was a button to skip forward and backward a certain block of time--say, 15 seconds--when listening to music. Audible has this sort of rewind feature. With Spotify, I have to unlock my phone and take my chances rewinding or skipping ahead with the progress slider. Makes using the app a pain."
"I do love Spotify but PLEASE make some kind of incognito mode. I listen to metal in my daily life but at night time I like to listen to ASMR or rain sounds due to my tinnitus but now all of my recommendations/release radar/suggestions are just rain sounds and all the metal music is gone. I'm skipping 95% of the recommendations because of this. If I could turn incognito mode on at night time so it wouldn't ruin my regular playlists it would be awesome. Please, please, please consider this!"
"Sometimes the app will randomly play songs that are not on my playlists, from singers that I have never listen to. It's quite creepy when it's 3 AM and suddenly my phone plays instrumental songs. Tried some solutions like unlink my facebook and log out of the app, but those didn't seem to solve the problem"
"Excellent variety of music I like, recommended tunes new to me, and playlists I'd loop. Bad advertising, makes me never want to get whats advertised, sound during ads needs to be a lot quieter, add a random song generator based on my preferences, and add smart options for riding bicycle, like the car options please!"
"Have had Premium for years and love it to bits when it works. BUT like many of the reviews lately constantly glitching is becoming a drag as it requires me to uninstall and reinstall the app. Glitches include: not streaming certain songs even when wifi or 4g is fine, not playing selected songs or albums at all, blank screen and general unreliability. Should probably be 3 stars but like I said, it's great when it works üôÇ"
"Very good! but some annoying problems Its a great app but the problems are 1st you only can skip 6 songs in 1hr and if you want to repeat songs it pauses then starts again , if you want to make a playlist it says the artists thats in it but the songs dont show up until you press that artists button, it would be great ot if you'd fix that lots of people are having problems with that, thank you. üëëüíéüíø"
Music Quality Is really Good.. Buffering is comparatively Less From Jiosaavn and airtel music app. User Interface is quite good. The best Thing is its User Curated Playlists. But sometimes Ad repeats itself even before the 30 min Time gets over.
"Great app for anyone listening to music, casually or whatnot. Spotify is however not the best method for artists to earn money, especially smaller ones. The spread of pay/play is too wide between big and small artists. Would be good if there was a donate button for each artist."
"Great experience, best interface and new music discovering experience. Private session button should be easier to access."
If you don't mind a few adverts you can listen to tunes you can pay and get more benefits easy to use and I just keep it on shuffle as long as my phone gets a signal I can listen to quite alot of songs. 02 data runs out super fast so I've Changed networks. Make a couple of playlists ‚ú®.
"If you can't afford to build up your own digital library this is your best option, just tell the app the artists and genres you like and it'll make up playlists for you, occasionally it'll surprise you with something new or something you'd forgotten about."
"Some artists songs (1nonly/skeler), stop playing, or it's like someone pressed the mute button while I'm checking my email. Other artists like Kanye West play without issues. Don't know what's going on but it needs to be resolved."
"For some reason the ""playlist"" button isn't working/responding for me (the one in the bottom right when viewing a song next to the ""share"" button). Pressing it doesn't take me to the current playlist or queue - it only show a little animation of being pressed and nothing else happens. Other than that, a great app and service!"
"It was so good until today. I don't know what happened but I think my subscription ran out and now I can pause, skip or anything. I can only play songs but after like 5 minutes of not opening the app it stops and the music is really quiet. It doesn't even pause when I open a video. Please fix this, I really wanna enjoy music a bit more"
It was amazing being able to listen to music and look through my Instagram at the same time but I hate not being able to pick a specific song to listen to without having to pay for premium but overall it's quite a cool app
"So, it has everything one might ask for. But there is an issue. That is, the app doesn't like have any idea what you are playing in premium, so sometimes in songs that make you cry like crazy amounts of tears, it will say: ""Wow what a song. Makes ME feel like dancing."" It's quite embarrassing you know. So please take care of this in the next update."
"I would need two extra features for this app to rate it 5 stars: -a timer to turn Spotify ON at a specific time (not just off like the sleep timer does) -to be able to see the current song & play/pause/forward and back buttons on my phone's lock screen. My old phone running Android 7 used to have this, but for some reason it stopped after a while"
"the service is great but the UI of the app isnt. It lacks some really useful features: like, for example, the ability to select multiple songs at the same time to add or remove them from a playlist or the ability to swipe to delete them. really easy stuff the absence of which is really annoying. bugs are not unusual"
I'm surprised I like it better than Pandora. But the UI is not as good. It's very busy and takes time to learn. I prefer clean and simple. Still it selects good music.
All over a good app in my opinion the best music app that is out there you can listen to any song and there is in built lyrics but there is one thing I used Spotify premium it doesn't work in airplane mode but it's the best
"Spotify is a very nice app, and I use it everytime to listen to music. But it has a tendency of lagging sometimes, and sometimes the screen even fully freezes and I can't do anything. So I'm removing one star for that. Other than that, I think Spotify is great to use with many diverse music/podcast options and an easy and convenient design."
"quality of music is really special especially classical music As of today not sure what the problem is but spotify wont work on my mobile phone. Tried uninstalling , cleared cache, reinstalled but when trying to push the play button on any song nothing happens. Any ideas on the problem?"
"For the people complaining about ads and not to being able freely play music... quit being cheap. the app is the best music streaming app and its available on almost every platform. My only critique is... i guess right before an update is released the functionality doesn't work right on Android OS 10. The music plays but, it doesnt display the right song info playing and it frequently stops playing the song until you hit play again. Hey Devs! When we gonna get that linux support?? Lol"
The latest update has ruined everything. Even if I want to play from my playlist I can't and the songs all are shuffled by itself I can't playback the song I like because it has only got forward option and not a backward option and only I can skip 6 songs per hour. I mean what the hell is that? At first I gave 5 star rating because the app is much better than any other apps but now due to this update I'm reducing one star. I hope you guys will bring back the old version.
"Quite good, toooo many adds but overall it's an amazing app:) also a lyrics translator would be a great extention....but it lacks many of the features on my old devices and by many I mean MANY so....yeah... Overall it's amazing"
"This app is amazing and the audio quality even in the free version is very good. Beautiful UI and good performance as well. I don't give it five stars cause I sometimes miss the lyrics of songs inside the proper app rather than having to Google them. Also, I've checked the prices of premium versions in other music apps as well and they are the same as Spotify, so I would recommend to low the price al least a bit so that people rather pay for Spotify and not for other apps."
I've had spotify for years now and I'm happy with the service! I have a quick suggestion. I have a google chrome cast. On my other computers I was able to download my playlist onto my laptop but unfortunately I was unable to download on this computer. Why is that? I was honestly curious because every other device that I own can download the playlists/songs/podcast but doesn't on my computer :( I would like an update so compatibility is possible... Other than that I love the service and will continue using. Just a small complaint...
Over all a good app but something annoys me so much that I want to quit Spotify that whenever I search up a song or something it just Lags out I have find songs by writing the artists name and then scroll down so much pls fix this since I have premium and this is annoying
It's really good with premium. Although the UI leaves quite a lot to be desired. Without premium it is seriously lackluster.
If you're having a problem with your service you can email them at the developer link below and prob get a quick response. It's a Saturday and I did not expect them to get back to me today. The app wasn't working for me at all the last week. I was communicating with them most of the day and it was a hassle but in the end we came to a solution and it works now. They provided me with a free month when I requested it and everyone was really friendly. New UI is not my preference. 2 stars usability.
It's a great app and the features are good except for one feature that was just added called the blends I try to start one and I click on the button and nothing happens so my girlfriend tried to start one with me I clicked the link and it just redirected me to the homescreen of the app other than that it's a really good app
I like the app but what I don't like is that the app add things on to my playlist and I like to listen to my music not what you put in for me to do so when I push to random order button it shows a song that y'all put on their stop doing that.
I still think there are some fixes that coulc be done to the UI but i love the amount of music that i can discover on there from around the world. I will always enjoy that.
I'd give it 5 stars. It takes time to figure out how to do all the things it features and provides. I heard you will have to re download all the songs you have again. Kinda the con in my thoughts. But other then having to build the Spotify to your own preference for music.
"Good... But... It would be nice if you added a ""not interested"" button on the ""things you might like"" row. I kinda get sick of seeing the same things that I'm not going to play over and over again. And for things I started to play, something that I wound up not liking, to have a way of removing them from my stuff.."
this is a good app overall it's easy to make a playlist but i dont like that if you don't have premium access then sometimes the ads interrupts half of the song i was listening to & then it ruins it and skips to the next song
"It's a great app, I've had the premium for some years now, but recently some bugs started happening, like I used to be able to change music pressing the side buttons of my phone, for some reason I can't anymore. I also used to be able to change music and pause or play on locked screen, I also can't anymore so what's happening?"
"Really good app overall, and the redesign does look great. Only issue I have is that the app keeps showing a downloading notification every time I open the app. Even when there's nothing to download it just starts downloading for whatever reason."
"There could be better recommendations and rewind songs refreshes! After continuous listening for about 2 hours of playback per day you get bored of your own songs! That's where the old hits repeat is needed to be just perfect! Still for some reason I find the car's radio more appealing because I hear unexpected great songs. Please redesign the algorithms and the old songs playlist to match more interests. Don't stick to what most people listen, but create uncommon playlists from past."
I will always be a Spotify user. I love your UI theme and you maintain independence from acquisitions. I will always keep my membership unless it gets ridiculously expensive. As far as the apps go I wish the Online/Offline toggle was more in the open. I don't like having to dig to get to it.
"While I like Spotify for its UX, I think the sound quality is better on my prime music account. I have tried listening to the same song on both, using Bose speakers, and opinion is unchanged."
I would have given this app 5 stars but I only listen to older music.There is quite a few songs I can't get and a lot of them are remastered but apart from that I like the app . I opted to upgrade and pay for the app
"Great app and the music selection is cool, but I don't like the fact that in a gospel mix, other genre of music gets to show up frequently. It ruins the whole essence of the mix. But aside this, I'm enjoying every bit of the app"
"[Original Rating: ****]Installed recently, liking the experience so far. Great library management features, well laid out UI and excellent recommendations. Will update review after using for 6 months or so. Edit 1: Why am I seeing Hindi songs in my home screen suggestions, when I have not selected Hindi in my languages? I don't even have the option to remove it. *** now."
I normally just go to my liked songs and hit shuffle. internet was beinf slow and my phone was saying its full. after a bit i find the notification sayinh im downloading something and it turns out there is this little download songs button that requires no verification. my phone was trying to download all 1200 songs on my list. please fix. i know its impossible to get ahold of the company unless i get some petition signed but its worth a shot
"Spotify is good if you have premium, which is quite expensive, however the benefits may be worth it for you since the ability to have a large selection of music on your phone ad free and downloadable is very nice. That privelidge just comes at a relatively high price."
"Love the app, but the most recent update that removed the rewind button in the lock screen player is extremely frustrating, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way. The like button is useless in this mini player, we benefited much more from the rewind button. Please bring it back..."
"I've been using Spotify for years and really enjoy it. I only wish they would bring back the dislike button, so you wouldn't have to keep skipping songs you don't like."
"Love it but it does have an annoying tendency to ""undownload"" album and playlists I have downloaded as well as quite often tell me there is no internet connection when there is...and when it does this I can't access any music downloaded or otherwise. Apart from that I love it..."
"It's a great music streaming app, the ads are quite irritatating, but they aren't as frequent as I thought they'd be. But over all very happy with the app."
It's a really good app for music lovers like me.But as a tablet user which has just 16GB space it's quite difficult to have Spotify as it takes too much space.It already has taken over more than 1.5 GB of my space.So I request you to reduce the space taken over by Spotify when you're at leisure.I would give five stars if my Spotify space would be lower than 700MB.(I also know of Spotify lite but it's not possible for me to make it into landscape.So please make it possible to rotate my screen)
"Just using a months free trial and works great but i'll only be taking up a subcription if they bring out c.d. lossless as the quality isn't quite there for me, untill they do (if?) I'll stick with qobuz."
"Please, add option to get back ""Previous track"" button to minimized version of player in notifications. Last update changed it to like button, which i don't use"
"Wonderful selection of music to suite all ages. On or Off line, you can listen to any track you want or a selection of tracks or pod casts"
"Good app, however be weary. Whilst listening to music if you did not get premium then ads and ""suddgested"" music tracks, these are annoying because whilst listening to music you may have to waste your skips just to get past music you don't want to hear and the fact it requires Internet for no readkn. But apart from these criticisms it's a good app."
"I genuinely loved this app being able to have so many songs that I love downloaded being able to listen to all the time. But the last few months have been real bizarre. I would be going through listening to songs and then It will like freeze on one song and then when ya click out of it, it's not even titled the same... and it would freeze my whole phone like this has happened like 10+ times today it's getting annoying and idk why it's like this"
"Good App, Many songs are available.. But there are too many adds that is very disturbing... And to remove those adds we have to take premium.. which requires money.. And 8 and many more customers can't take it.. So if u kindly remove the adds üôÇüôÉüôèüèª"
"the App by itself is awesome, the new UI is such good and simple and the player is perfect. But a good addition is if we could easily personalize our infos without being necessary open the website on a PC."
BEST OF BESTEST APP to listen adds. Top quality adds and sometimes songs come in between..but it's okay. They're not long enough to ruin your mood!! INSTALL THIS APP RIGHT NOW TO LISTEN SELF ROAST. Yeah they roast their own adds. I'm giving 4stars Because I don't like when songs interrupt while listening my favourite addvertisement. Hope you guys will. Work on it. Thanks for bringing us so much‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
"Edit: Great UI revamp, lot has changed since the last time. Things are less boxy and I love it. The only improvement I can think of is add a swipe down to minimize now playing."
Don't underestimate repetition please put a repetition button for ponds as well maybe you don't know how important it could be for a language learner. Other then that I'd say alright!
It's a pretty good music app for streaming the only complaint I have is that you can't listen to what you want for free it plays simler songs but the song you want normally pops up pretty quick so it dinsy really matter
While I love Spotify you have an issue with privacy 1. There is no block button there should be one for people you either don't wanna see or want to see your music 2. Even with the private playlist they are not actually private someone who is following you can see what your listening to and click the playlist your using and listen to it despite the private option I just wanna say music is very personal to the individual and privacy settings need to be updated ASAP
"Great app, well designed with ton of great features. Reduced one star after I tried Apple music, the loudness on Apple music is much more than Spotify without compromising music quality."
"Everything is perfect, downloading should've been made easier and offiline mode should have looked more like an inbuilt music player app. Would recommend regardless."
"Mixed reliability. I've the paid version. Recently the ""Now Playing"" screen is different than the music actually selected/playing. It requires a reinstall to reset. PITA!"
It's the greatest out there but it's not great. Some UI improvements are needed and they need to fix issues regarding loyalties of albums. Some core albums are missing like Pornography from The Cure..
"Like most other people I have had Spotify for some time and I it quite fun but there are a few downfalls to it. One being after you have listened to some of the song for a while e.g. all star by smash mouth or something like that, it for some reason says it is playing the song you have put in but sounds a lot different as if it was a cover or a remix someone has done and it is very annoying as it has happened to me a few times now. I really don't like the remixes of the songs unless I want to."
One of the best Music Applications I have used in recent times.Not sure it's the best for Africa as it requires Data .If you can add lyrics it would be superb!
"Marvelous application it's design virtual , framework all are top notch , wide variety of artists and genres make it the best application for songs and as well as podcasts. You must be thinking why 4 stars instead of 5 that is because on slow internet speed the songs take too long to start and when they start the lyrics take too long to show up and are sometimes not in synchronisation with the song"
"I've been using Spotify for a while now since play music has been shut down and it alright I guess, you can listen to the songs you want when you want unless you have premium, amd after every 2 songs you get ads I don't mind the ads but they are quite frequent and it guess annoying. And it's annoying that in your playlist you can select which song you want to listen to. But I have to say that I had premium and I had no complaints but I can't afford it üò™"
"The app is great, but there's one problem. When running other apps, it can randomly stop running. I think this could be fixed by the notification being only able to be dismissed by a specific button, like Samsung Music."
"Keeps crashing when I begin to play Joe Rogan podcast and freezes everytime I close and open the app again. Then it forces me to uninstall and install again. Also I am really disappointed I get ads during podcast, I thought we get premium just to avoid them in the first place. Other than that I am quite satisfied with the app, but the crashing needs to stop. It's extremely annoying."
The UI is very good looking & the collection of songs is also great. But I have a suggestion please consider adding lyrics to the song.
Very nice app. Cheap and convenient. Audio quality is good for on the go but for listening with nice audio equipment at home is not enough. I'm waiting for Spotify lossless and then it will be 10/10 üòÅ
A great way to listen to favourites old and new. I can keep up with latest releases from artists I love to hear. Quite a few adverts but not a problem to me.
"""Random"" setting on playlists plays the same songs as well as liked songs. Not intuitive. Impossible to see last song played without restarting it. Prefer Pandora layout."
"It feels wonderful to listen to songs on this app.A wide range to suit all tastes and every age , it really is a very good and happy experience."
This Is a lot better than gaana and all other music apps but the ads make it a bit annoying please put that one long ad so we can get 30 min of continuous music its very annoying to get 2 double ads in between songs and that's the only issue with the app . The UI is amazing and clean and experience is also good
"Its a very suitable app for music lovers. But please slow down on the ads. Ive used spotify for 3 years now and its really frustarting. I would be in my vone, relaxing, then BOOM. My mood is ruined by a stupid ad!"
"Good service but UI and UX need work. The mobile search interface is very basic and rather than having to press on the hamburguer menu to add to play list. A multibox select would be nicer. The player is pretty basic . I have to reset the replay option everytime I switch songs manually. It is a good service, but it needs more thought and work."
"The user experience isn't all that stream lined. It can be clunky at times. That being said, I use this app everyday and have been a consistent user for year because the service and content is great!"
"Incredible algorithm, but editing/managing playlists is so minimal it's tedious. Would need at least a checkmark selection system with ability to add multiple songs to a list & move multiple lists between folders. Bring back the ""play all playlists inside folder"" option. I would LOVE a quick way to remove current song from current playlist. I get that they don't want clutter, & steer users towards Spotify playlists instead, but such basic things should be standard. Brilliant AI though!"
"Easy to use... however giving it 4 stars because often it freezes, doesn't work and I have uninstall and install again ( which is quick!) especially when wanting to connect to my car system."
"I love this app, it is just amazing, I listen to Discover Weekly and like songs that I then download to my phone from liked songs. Well, I can't do that because all of my liked songs are automatically deleted or disappearing so I cannot download songs to my phone. I'm finding this really stressful because it's the thing I've been doing for ages now, and it's now being ruined. That's the only reason why I give 4 stars, not 5. It'd be 5 stars if I weren't for this thing that's happening. Pls fix."
"I like this app alot. Very convenient to just add songs I like to my playlist with the push of a button. However, I don't like how it plays 'suggested songs' and not my playlist. I just want to hear my liked songs, not similar songs. It's very annoying and frustrating."
Was great but since last update plays one song then turns off. Some improvement but would like a repeat button to play fav songs again and i don't like having songs added to my playlist that i didn't choose.
Good app. However its not very intuitive and accessing the sleep function a little long winded. As it's a function that most people will use it should be more direct. I do like the fact you get a daily selection based on what I previously listed to. All in all a good app.
"Overall is good but I have one bug/problem. When I open 1 album I cant play it, but when I click play it can and I already used the premium. I only can listen by using click the play button but not the song it self because the song it's dark like unavalaible from the display but it's there and playable."
"Great app,I have premuim and if you have the money it's well worth it. I'm on an old device which might cause issues, but it works well and I have only had to uninstall and reinstall once"
Autoplay is not working. Hope the developer will review and fix the bug. Besides that the widget needs to be redesigned.
"Brilliant app with very good suggestions, very smooth experience of the app maybe too smooth. Customisation of user experience in the app is the one thing I found lagging. And would love to see these additions; 1. Seperate tab for podcasts. 2. Should be able add whole/selected songs to user playlist 3. Lyrics maybe? and More info on artist/arts. 2021 Lyrics are in ! üôå"
"Very good app, Free version not worth it. Upgrade to premium, way better experience and no ads or shuffle. I love Spotify overall, Good UI and musical experience."
"it good I guess the one problem I have for it is the ui for playlists on android look so bad. Like they look fine on apple just port that look over to android. Update, they made it look good."
"All time best ! Spotify is just the best music app. Really good UI , accurately recommends songs according to your music taste. The reason I am giving 4 stars is because √ó) It does not always give you 30 mins ad free music when you see an ad. That is hella annoying √ó) Song pauses automatically , tho it is really rare it still does happen."
"The app used to be great when I first started using it and it won't even allow me to login and I'm paying for it...I've to delete all my data on the app just to be able to log in again, this is a massive inconvenience, not to mention the money I've wasted paying for it the last couple of months, and the data costs involved as I've tried to rebuild my 1000+ song music catalogue."
It is really disgusting to download each song by taping the three dots button. I think there should have a download button while I play the song. Thank u
I have been using Spotify for years and have loved it. The most recent update is not working correctly. It's glitches all the time. I hope they fix this quickly.
"Premium user over here. the app is incredibly slow, it stopps and removes the downloaded songs on its own. the graphics are orrible, not to mention not functional. the previous one was the best. and last thing, in 2019, we still can't change our username nor the playlist cover image/ user image unless we're using the desktop app"
"Please re design the filters! I'm sick of the filters resetting! I just want to see whats in my downloads and not everything together. Also, when changing to other downloaded pod casts can u make it start the next pod cast by date? I mean if I'm listening 5o may8th and i want it to go to may 9th. Instead the next episode starts at june 23rd the newest pod cast. Bahh"
"I love Spotify but I hate the new update! It's awful. I can't find my saved albums anymore when I go to an artist and am instead directed to their homepage. Also who came up with the idea of filter the search for playlists, artists, albums podcasts instead of having them be tabs/ buttons? Awful üòû pls change it back or update it to something better!"
"I use the free version. It's very good. For sure the premium version is better, without apps and designing your own lists..."
Its a really cool app...i like this app but u need he premium version for better experience. I'm not really happy that u can't skip music without paying for it. But other than that's its quite ok
Excellent App for international songs and Fluid UI. Only thing hinders the app is the frequency of the ads. Like 3 ads one after another is horrible experience for end user.
A genuinely fantastic app that obviously cares as much about music as its users do. The only reason it doesn't have five stars is because for a lot of my larger playlists when I try to shuffle them I seem to get the same collection of songs playing rather than the many other songs on the playlist that haven't been played as much
"I'd give it 4¬Ω really, but sometimes the app will randomly close and make me listen to songs from the start again and I can't afford premium so it's quite irritating, also the home page layout is slightly awkward- But yeah pretty good app in general, audio is high quality and it's a very nicely designed layout."
"Very happy with Spotify for the most part. Some software issues & some menu options are not user friendly or intuitive. Also, I have a premium membership but still get ads on podcasts (It took a long time to get customer service to respond to this issue) & Although I understood the reason why it's still disappointing since I paid for the membership in order to not have ads (maybe posting that fact @ point of purchase?) Other than those couple issues, I think Spotify is awesome!"
"Pretty good for the most part. There have been quite a few songs though that Spotify does not have, which can be frustrating when you're paying for a service."
"edit* Love the new GUI Bugs(not sure if fixed, will update) *Sometimes music played before wont play when play is pressed. I have to skip the song and come back to it for it to play. *Sometimes downloaded songs wont play. *Sometimes, when offline, downloaded playlists wont play music and sometimes wont even load. *When offline it takes ages for downloaded music to load as well as show."
"The UI is good, although Please add an option to download individual tracks . and integrate a light theme if it's possible. then add an option to see lyrics real time instead of those short peek videos, i think it's useless no one listen to music by looking into those videos. then add an option to search song by lyrics it will be a huge help. There is a huge gap in market of audiobooks. you can add regional audio books into ur library and solve my prblm of subscribing audio books apps ."
Pretty good generally. Every now and then it gets in this writer's state where it pauses playing until you turn the screen back on on your phone. Restarting the phone seems to fix it. It also takes ages loading up podcast episode menus and such quite often. Overall it is pretty clunky but provides a great resource.
I don't really like the UX changes in the last version. It takes a lot more effort to scroll through the 30 or so auto-generated playlists. Overall I like the app but I wish the UI was either more customizable or tuned more towards usability.
I have Spotify premium. The downloaded songs gets deleted and requires fresh download everyday. Also a lot of issues like app not starting and currently playing music track getting paused on its own.
"Love the app! But sometimes play/pause button doesn't always work, especially when rotating phone from horizontal to vertical and vise versa"
"Liked the free version just fine but then needed to build a collection of music to download for when I'm out of cell service and am pretty happy now listening commercial free and unlimited skips. The software tries to recognize your taste in music as well, then recommends songs and artists which is pretty awesome to hear new music I wouldn't any other way"
"UI could use some tweaks, and it recently changed its ability to play a set song in a playlist as a starting point; now it just plays a snippet. Shuffle wasn't available at the start, now it's the primary. Good overall but not overly intuitive."
"Still the most stable version of the application for a while. I have occasional hiccups with the interface not missing and staying as a black screen. I dislike the fact the ""like"" heart is right next to the pause button, it can be accidentally pressed far too easily, removing said song from your library. I would prefer for prices to not rise once again. Aside from that all is good."
"The app is really nice! There's a huge choice of songs. Everything is perfect except one thing. Suddenly my button stop/play became white, and I can't return ordinary button. What can i do, help me please!"
"Just joined with a family account. So far good. 4* because screen sometimes freezes and playing details don't update when quickly moving on to next tune. Cleared cache etc, restarting the phone does not help."
"Next time chose the featured ADS. Do me a favor to remove the Creamsilk ads saying ""napabayaan"" seriously, someone had a heart attack when she heard the ads for the first time and its night time. I dont want to hear a horrifying sound of a helpless in the middle of the night scaring people to death. This is not a kind of stragegy of your company just to force everyone to subscribe to premuim? hell no. uninstalling the app. I feel sorry for my friend she passed away. May she rest in peace."
"Spotify is phenomenal, there's no argument about that but some times it just stops and I think a more suitable version of all devices needs to be made without removing any other features and graphics"
"Like the app but I dont like it when the paus button and forward/backwards buttons shows on screen in the backgrond when the app is closed, I can see it better when I open some apps with white background, its good that it doesnt show when you take a screenshoot"
"I love this app so much,I love that I can see other artists and hear their music it's a good app and I even went premium and it's a good thing I got this app so soon all my favorite music at a tap of a button it's the best wow no problems at all oh and I like that I can save all my favorite songs on one playlist."
I find this app way better than pandora unlike pandora u can create playlists and play certain songs for free withouit paying for a subscription to do so however there is alot of ads which i expect because its free to use and optional to buy premuim like most free games or apps people should expect to see ads when its a free app or game (other than stuff like hulu or disney + ect)
Nice app and easy to use. Algorithm is flawless too but can i wish there is a block button where i can block certain people from seeing my playlist since music is very personal to me and i dont feel comfortable sharing to everyone what im listening to specially when Im going through something.
"*Changed Review to 4 Stars as they have reverted app back to old format. New update to the Mobile UI is ridiculously BAD „Äätldr: each home page category now only shows 1 ""tile"" this means you loose 90% of you easily navigatable options. What this really means is unless you want to listen to only the one ""made for playlist"" or music you have already listened to or you are out of luck. Absolutely everything now has to be done through the search tab. All BAD."
"It's a great app, however it sometimes does crash (at least for me) and when using the app when listening to music on windows 10 Spotify app, the lines for the time in the songs doesn't sync up that well and requires some effort to get the times to match when wanting to use the behind the lyrics on mobile."
"Overall very happy with Spotify. But, over the past year or two, something must've changed with their algorithm and it isn't quite as good as it used to be."
"I don't like a lot of the recent UI updates, and it can be glitch. But overall, a great music app Highly Recommend"
"Would have been 5 star but since an update it's 4. quick offline mode taken away from the drop down drawer....now I have to go in to the app to go offline. *Edit - now 3 stars as they've now removed the widget! I've seen nothing new, only taking features away! *2nd edit...back to 4 stars as the widget is back."
"Great range of music. In fact quite literally 'Something for everyone!"" It sometimes has a few hiccups which are resolved by pausing and un-pausing and the obvious adverts every half hour, but going for the basic free subscription like myself it's a small price to pay. I can see it being problematic if you're forking out a few quid for full access though"
the quick settings media control panel in Android 11 acts wonky from time to time. It just disappears. Thank you for bringing back the queue and adding recently played.
I mean it is my go to app for all my music listening. And i listen to music at least 4-8 hrs a day. Problem is on mobile i got an issue with the player. I was listening to a podcast and now the music player ui is bugged. It is stuck on that one episode nomatter what music im playing. Music plays fine but i cant really use some features such as skipping ahead
"For a second, Spotify had a design change today and I'm sure I didn't dream it but it was awesome but then it disappeared so I decides to update the app thinking that was it but the cool design is gone. Dafuq?"
It's always slow to do what I want it to do. Lately it will show a different title then the song I'm on. It doesn't automatically update even though I have it set to automatic. It's still a great app but apps like YouTube music could quickly make spotify null
Very good app. Could definitely use a find button in each library. Also a way of sorting the songs by artist or title within the library would bring my review up to 5 stars.
Easy to search for and play music and podcasts. I like the fact that it uses wi-fi and Bluetooth for connecting to google speakers as well as headphones. My only wish is that when trying to use my entire home network to play throughout the home there is no guidance on how to achieve this
"Impressive music catalog, across genres and languages. Paid subscription is a must for a fluid experience. Premium prices could be a bit better."
"Its a decent music listening with a lot of options, but if youve been using the app for 3+ years like me the constant weird ui changes get annoying and it makes things cluttered and confusing more often than not."
"Did interns design the UI? (1) The ""Search"" tab is difficult to navigate because it's an illogical mess, like ""Dance/Electronic"", ""Mood"", ""Frequency"", and ""EQUAL"" are literally right next to each other. I usually look for playlists based on music genres, and witnessing ""Higher Ground"" mixed with ""Metal"" and ""Punk"" hurts my eyes and my brain. (2) ""Your Library"" tab is a mess with filter options like a shopping website instead of a tidy curation. I can't find peace even in my own library. Unfair."
Great app but expensive for the ability to skip tracks.. All in all the functions and options all work well on my device and I do like how it functions quickly and personally I've never really had any major issues force closes or lagging while loading my playlists and podcasts.. Would get more stars but for the expense..
"It's very easy to make a playlist but if you don't have premium you get like 2 songs then 4 adds, that gets very annoying very quick."
17 may - anyone with sync across devices issue JUST REINSTALL THE APP & IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM. It worked perfectly for couple of years until the recent updates messed it up. The real-time synching among devices is so messed up. I loved the feature of continuing my music be it I'm listening to it on PC & have to go out but still continue with it. But it's all messed up now. 17 May 2021: 1 star. Now can't even access my library after recent update.
"I rate spotify 4 stars cuz i wont lie, you guys algorithm is too good. But please, could we be allowed to download individual songs??? And also, individual releases should be treated as singles and not albums with just 1 song in them. It messes up the whole experience for offline listening. Thanks alot. Also i would like some changes to the UI/UX, could it be more interactive and nicer looking with a little elements here and there?"
"Hi, the app is great, can you consider making the car mode option available when playing music either in the 3 dot options or as an icon on the UI while music is playing, I realized that I always had to go to settings to change it when driving and when I get home I have to change back to the normal settings, thanks!"
"Awesome way to listen to music but there are quite a few gaps in selection if you want to listen to music from countries outside of North America and Western/Central Europe, especially for traditional forms."
"Don't really love this app, but, could be a replacement for other apps which requires WiFi. With Spotify, I don't need WiFi to play. But, it imposes it's own musics on me when I don't want..."
"Happy with most of the app. I wish that I could simply hit the ""thumbs down"" button from any window rather than sometimes having to go into the menue to do it."
"Best music streaming out there. App UI/layout navigation is a little cluttered though. Especially with the latest update, the library/playlist/artist etc. are mixed together in one list and you need to tap on (poor)filters to actually pick one category. That's an unnecessary 2-3 steps"
I like this app very much. But there should be a option for replay music. As if you play it in background and do something else in your phone and when the song finishes you need to replay it but there isn't a button for that. You have to open the app and replay. I love this app. Please add this feature. I love it great app. Thanks
Amazing app. In Spotify Lyrics showing well in Indian language songs. But in Musixmatch don't show Lyrics with Indian language songs in Android. Musixmatch Lyrics working well in Windows but Spotify does not show lyrics in Windows. . Add some new features- - Lyrics design (colors etc. like Musixmatch) - Word by work Lyrics
Overal love Spotify but I don't love the recent update to the library. The filtering system means I have to click many buttons to get to my downloaded podcast episodes. They're not the same as New Episodes. And when I do filter down to downloaded podcasts I still have to click into the podcast to find the episode. Music and podcasts are very separate for me and this mixes them all together and it's hard to find what I want. Hopefully this feedback helps in upcoming developments.
"Great app and great service overall. But. The ""Behind the Lyrics"" system works in a completely non-intuitive way, it tries to pack too much ‚Äî facts about the song and real-time lyrics and misses both shots for me. Also, most of the songs don't show the lyrics at all which is sad."
Had premium for 5 years. I love it! No regrets! 2021 edit: The new update is kinda garbage. I hate it. It doesn't work too well on mobile. Can you fix this or revert back to the old design?
I am using spotify since a very long time and its quiet a decent app to use on a daily basis for music and podcasts . Although sometimes it frustrates a lot .
"It's Kool, but I wish adding songs to playlist was a maximum of 2 step operation. egg: a + button on the current track playing screen tap and select playlist title to add the song that is currently playing. Thnx"
I am using it for quite some time ... I expected it to reduce the number of adds ... But now it shows 2-3 adds after a song ... It's REALLY REALLY FLUSTRATING ... I would have bought the premium ... But now I won't ... JUST BECAUSE IT SHOWED SO MANY ADDS !! ... But ... Adds aside ... The app is good ... And I can find a lots of various daily mixes ... And all ...
"well, i used spotofy sonce 2016, and about 2-3 month ago i used the premium spotify. I like how UI spotify, it's so simple, but sometimes i can't play a song in my laptop, and i can't share song on instagram stories. I wish spotify can be better next time"
"Once upon a time, long time ago, there was this quick feature for making it appear the search bar, with just scrolling more towards up when reached at the top, rather than mentally torturing click 'menu' button and find the 'search' option to make it appear. This is a one neat clear move of downgrading."
"Its so easy to use and I use it on a daily bases . I hope it brings you as much joy as it brings me ! I would 100% recommend Spotify if you like a selection of amazing podcasts , and music. though unless you buy premium there is alot of unessisary ads and since the update it crashes quite alot."
"Wish lyrics showed for every song, i know they use Genius but even when the lyrics are available on their website they don't show up on the app. The shuffle button only works once too."
Great app with a few technical issues here and there. Overall good experience. Been using spotify for about 8 years now exclusively for all my music and they have made steady improvement to the UI. Hopefully they continue this trend.
It's an interesting and amazing app ‚ò∫Ô∏è and it's very easy to use you have to just login and then you can used without premium songs you can also listen the songs with add free it's quite good good app
Friendly to use. Provide good suggestions on songs/music to suit individual's preferences. Huge varieties of songs/music from all ages & for all kinds of mood.
"The app itself is very intuitive, but when used in the background, the music and app constantly shuts down. This is because for android, it is impossible for spotify to be the default music player. Please resolve this issue ASAP."
I loved the app but with the removal of the widget in the last upgrade. it makes it cumbersome to access quickly and rapidly to the music. very bad marketing and developers choice.
"I am unable to download the app on my phone. I have tried restarting, clearing cache, every possible option but I can't download it. It's very annoying that I am facing this issue and would love a quick solution."
"Since some time I can't control my songs that are playing on Alexa from my phone, so I need to start listening music on the phone and then send it to Alexa. And if I want to change the song or playlists, I need to go back to the phone, change, and then send it to Alexa again. It's quite a mess, but the overall app is great."
"Its a great app, ui is easy to navigate and searching for specific songs is easy. But if you want to see every song a creator/artist made you have to check every albulm they have which is dumb in my opinion. On top of that one of my favorite artists got all his music removed and i have no idea why. The only way i can play his music now is to download it to my phone, i eould rather it just be on spotify with the rest of the music i listen to. Bring his music back his name's Xyperus"
"I love this app, I really do. But this latest update has completely messed up streaming through other devices (speaker etc) wich is how I primarily use it. Also getting 3 ads in a row is really not okay. Edit: now that the streaming issue has been fixed it is much better but there's still quite a few ads."
"Great range of music and selection of playlists. However for this past update (8.6.20.1063), the 'like' button is either delayed or does not respond at all, yet the other buttons are fine. Also and more annoying, pressng the menu button on the 'Now Playing' page cause the whole app to crash. All of this happens when the app is switched to Offline Mode."
"It's a good music application overall, I can access to almost all songs and I discover new songs and genre everyday, the app also recommended nice playlist that suited my preferences. The GUI is a lot cleaner after a new update too, it's easy to scroll and very accessible. Giving 4 stars because there are a few albums that my country do not have access to so I would really love if you can make all albums accessible in all countries with spotify. Thanks."
"I'll rate it four stars because if you're not a premium user, ads will always pop in the next three or five songs which is the bad effects when you're not a premium user. But over all, it's quite good."
"I am a huge fan of this app, I enjoy everything about it even as a non-premuim user. The only thing preventing me from getting premium are the payment options. If it were available to subscribe via Credit/Airtime I and many other free users would definitely subscribe. Please consider this. Many thanks."
"I really like this app and I love that it's free! The only thing that I have a problem with is the volume with some advertisment are crazy high. We can listen to music at my job but we have to keep it at a reasonable volume , the higher volumes of certain ads keeps me running to the volume button all day."
"I am using it for a quite along time. It is a app for listening music. But nowadays it is creating problem of internet issue on mobile data (I have a good mobile internet connection) while on a road trip or like occasion where wifi is not available. So, I would appreciate if Spotify will solve this issue soon."
"I just have one suggestion: work on lyrics. Some songs lack lyrics, and the competition is doing better, so take note. Also, is it just me or that the audio on this app is noticeably better than that on JioSaavn ? - at least for a free user, that is. All in all I'm quite pleased with what the company has done. Hopefully, the next update addresses lyrics."
Needs a setting for using shuffle play button or just a play button. Third party apps that start a playlist or song radio always default to shuffle play. I know how to not use shuffle play while im using spotify. But it is just annoying that other apps are stuck using the default start of shuffle play and having no option to change the default way spotify starts a playlist. Better than youtube music in every way though.
I can listen to so many variant songs... And I'm loving this ‚ù§ Thank you Spotify to make me feel different from all the ongoing conditions.. Your playlist specially designed for me.. Makes my day! Best music app everrr!
"the part I hated in spotify is that they add songs in my playlist....like I added the -gone- and -on the ground- music in my playlist so that when I play the music will make me feel better, then out of nowhere a random songs played in my playlist? you ruined the mood and I can play nor add them in different playlist ;-; but some features are awesome as well!"
"I love Spotify, it is the best music app out there. However the app is problematic recently. M ine will get stuck on songs that have been played and while playing new songs will show the graphics and information for a past song. I have not found a good solution and it is very troubling."
"This is a great app for all of your music, It has a wide variety of genres and performs extremely well. But has room for improvement. Been testing out their new group session feature and I am quite pleased with the performance it does have few glitches here and there but nothing to major. 4stars"
Great connection and streaming online for the whole family. Interface not intuitive to me at times. The weekly showcase is often very good. Thank you Spotify.
"I like spotify cause its free and on ps4 with mean i can bob to hip hop,singing,rock, and etc while playing crew 2 or need for speed. But i wish that they would ad more game theme songs like need for speed the run im looking for the music with the guitar solo in it. But in topic i have no problem spotify keep up the good work"
"Not as good as Google Play Music, but the next best thing since GPM is being merged into the terrible YouTube Music. A lot of great features but automatically generated playlists sometimes leave a little to be desired. I could turn on MC Lars radio and get surprisingly little MC Lars. Same goes with any other station. Sharing and co-creating playlists is great though... Don't use it for podcasts. If Spotify was as serious as they claim about podcasts they would create a designated podcast app."
Awesome app just wish there was an option if you heard a song (like sound hound) that you liked but didn't know who it was or what it was that you could press a button to save it to your liked songs! 5 stars if that was possible!
"This used to be a good app, but I've had a lot of problems with it for quite a while now. It crashes constantly. I keep thinking the updates will fix it, but things have not improved. I like the playlist feature and the overall user interface. I hope the glitches get resolved soon."
"So I'm having this problem where when I go to my liked song to play them it only plays the demo version and not the full song (and this jusd started happening to me today) and I have a free account and this hasn't happened to me before. How do I fix it so it plays the full version? I'm also having a problem where when I search a song it doesn't give me the option to play it, when I press the play button it plays other songs from that artist and not the song I wanna play. Can you please fix it?"
Absolutely liked the easy to use interface and it's vast playlist. Lyrics feature is also quite helpful . Would like more if it has an additional feature to change the language of the song Lyrics to our choice. It would be super great and helpful. Also kindly add more songs with Lyrics. Thanks for this wonderful service.
"Its good and all, but the ""Watch This 30 Second Advertisement For 30 Minutes Ad-Free Listening"" feature isn't working great. I'll hit the button it says to and then get five adverts for it."
"Spotify really needs to divide music and podcast into ""tabs"". I listen to a broad variety of music and podcasts, and having them all mixed in the same page doesn't seem very intuitive."
"Quite Good App, really appreciate it but sometimes ads come and Destroy your fun but u know if u take the premium pack, u won't get these irritating ads but if u don't , it's a total party crasher. But it's okay anyway pretty nice app . I recommend this app bcz it's much better than other music apps."
Spotify is one of the best music streaming services that I have used.It is pretty easy to use and since I use the premium version the overall experience has been pretty amazing.But when using the free version it gets a lit bit annoying to use since it gives a lot of ads when trying to play a song.The app itself has been pretty easy to use the UI is pleasing to the eyes although there is some room for improvement.My experience has been pleasant with the use of Spotify app..
"The app is great, it just needs a repeat button, and there's too much adds, could you at least remove a small percentage of the adds? Bcs of a non premium user it annoys me when i listen to songs and boom once an add plays I'll get 3-4 adds after that add, this is why i gave 4 stars and not 5"
"Never had a problem with this, though mis-inputs are common as hitboxes for buttons on the queue are quite small which can impact the vibe at a party etc."
"Almost perfect. The UI and Algorithm is great but I need Hi-fi audio. Please make it available as soon as possible. Compared to other streaming apps, I found Spotify the most convenient when it comes to paying. There are variety of paying modes."
This app is literally amazing i can find my music anywhere but thee ONLY problem is that i can skip over 20 songs on my laptop than on my phone. I dont have an iphone so i dont have mobile data. It plays 2 songs then quits on offline. 4 starts bc i want it offline
"There should be quick setting to change equalizer or equalizer that can be set on specific music. Secondly there should be a way to remove suggestion or recommendation on home, because I never listen to any local music and yet the home screen are filled with them."
"Pretty awesome music streaming service, however it glitches every once in awhile, and that can be quite frustrating."
"Brilliant app which lets me stream music flawlessly. However, podcasts are still not available in my country and I've to use a separate app for those. It would be nice to get my music and podcasts in a single place. Also I've noticed that during advertisement the volume goes higher than usual which is quite annoying. Hopefully these will be fixed."
"Your app is really good, but they keep adding songs to my playlists. Which I set for certain moods, at certain times and the additional songs just don't quite fit some times."
"Good app to use when u wanna find songs u forgot about from the past n to listen to newer music too, I use it to find songs I heard growing up so I can download them from mp3juices n myfreemp3, I use this app as well as downloading them from my 2 favorite websites"
"Undeniably the best music streaming and downloading service for the average listener, with podcasts being built into the app being a major plus. The subscription is rather expensive, and though it is not crucial, it is important if you want to listen with no interruptions and ads."
"It's very amazing app to listen to music. I really recommend it, but it requires to buy a premium membership if you try to listen to a certain song, and I don't like its this side."
"This is really powerfull app in music and podcasts, but its UI is bad. I hope they will work on it and design a more beautiful app than this. Youtube music and apple music are more beautifull in UI than spotify."
I have used this app everyday for years now. But thately songs will stop playing midway and i have to restart the song or ohyciallt hit play. Its quite annoying. Please fix this bug!
"Great. UI is clean, app is easy to use and there's a ton of music to discover. The app has this thing where is recommends music it thinks you'll like, I wish this recommendations refreshed more often. Or maybe some kind never ending queue with recommendations."
"Best music app ever. Just stop the damn ads please. You have no idea how frustrating and annoying they are, a lot of times it just ruins the mood"
"This app is usually fantastic, but it's recently been very slow. I downloaded the new update and now it is working again speed-wise, but now songs will only play for a minute or so before the app quits. When I open it back up the song is back at the start. It's very frustrating and I hope it is addressed soon!"
Have improved quite a lot. Lyrics feature is a good incorporation and Spotify should keep adding more. Still one the top bests apps. I listen it often with a Powerbeats Pro and it delivers very well
Very good. I always listen to my favourite songs when i had a fight or being depressed or having stress really cools me down(ads are genuinely annoying not criticising i know that's how it works) overall ‚ô•Ô∏èit. Recently i had faced some glitches i hope the developers can fix that hopefully
"It's an amazing app to discover new music. But some of the songs aren't there plus connecting it with the local music apps on phone is a rigorous process. Other than that, this app has quickly become my go-to song listening app."
"I know we're using a free version so It's quite obvious that we'll suffer from this advertising thing... Oke. But you play add after every 2 songs, which is quite extreme!"
"I am in love with spotify since its arrival in india. The great feature from my opinion is lyrics in regional language. Also, minimal design/ui of the app is also attracts me when switching to others. So far i am really happy with Spotify. Only a feature that will be worth if added is offline lyrics :)."
I have premium and whenever I open the app it says confirm your email address and it doesn't send a verification when I hit the button. but overall it's a great app.
This is really very good and easy to use app for organizing music. The UI works seamlessly. If there is no ADD..i would rate this app as Five Star. Thanks Spotify.
"Spotify is the Henry Hoover of music streaming for good reason, and you will download it for good reason. My only gripe is that when adding songs to a new playlist, it will only show a selection of liked songs and will never reshuffle that list - so after combing through the selection they give you, you need to manually trawl through your liked songs and slowly add them via the 'three dots'. Showing the entire liked song list from the 'create playlist' page would make this process far quicker."
"Connection to Chromecast is little buggy. It often can't find my speaker with built in chromecast, and often disconnects. While other apps work fine."
"Absolutely great app, I love it, the only issue I have when I connect my spotify to another app, it restets my playlist, what I mean by that is it reshuffles my que and it's quite annoying other than that it's great."
"I appreciate the ease of use, variety, and how shuffle won't play music from the same artist consecutively. However, as someone who falls asleep to the app, the call to action of ""Tap here to get 30 minutes of ad-free listeming."" is especially obnoxious since: a) ads play immediately after, and b) the station begins with that in the form of something that requires no action."
Have been using Spotify for a number of years now. Only failed to find a handful of of hundreds of songs that I enjoy. The ability to download and listen offline is excellent but every now and then the downloaded list disappears for unknown reasons. Mostly excellent app. Quite enjoy the end of year wrap-up that is provided too
The Music is awesome and of high quality. Just please lower the amount of ads because they are first extremely annoying and are high in number and it ruins your reputation as a company as it makes it look like your trying to force us to buy premium which means you are just greedy for money. Please address these things so i dont think this. Thanks
"Giving 4 stars because you have missed on a very simple yet important feature. To be able to export all the ""liked songs"" into a playlist which can then be shared. Do look into it. Will provide a great user experience."
"Spotify is a great app to listen to music, only 4 starts because you need premium to make it even better but it's definitely worth the $10 bucks a month especially if you love muisc like myself."
"Not a fan of the latest update. Don't like that tracks are no longer played immediately when you click on them, but you now get an option of playing or queuing everytime. Not a fan. Hope they choose to not continue with this and go back to how it was before."
"It's great but I give 4 stars because Spotify have effectively monopolised the music industry , there's no other suitable alternative .. the days of downloading dragging and dropping are long gone."
I'm glad to see the service in my country as I like it. But I can't download songs and one more thing - design of the widget should be updated. It's getting boring and ordinary.
"It was going well until there was a thing where i couldn't play any of my own playlists but i could play other playlists so this might be a glitch. The only was to turn on my music was to use the side bar (normally at the bottom) to select the playlist, the playlist would be playing but the shuffle button would stay at th play button. (I am a chromebook user by the way)"
"I'd give 5star but you guys are just increasing the rate of ads. I think it won't be so far in future that you'll make us hear ads and song in between. Just reduce the rate of ads, yeah I know that for that you have premuim but yet just make less ads or else first choice for music and 5 star app."
"The UI is easy to use. I would like to suggest you an idea. In India, we have 22 scheduled languages but are not well represented in every sphere. Including the folk songs of these languages might help you pull more customers. I like folk songs but my not of my own mother language are not present so I would like them to be present."
"Great app, quick and easy access. Only reason is the conflict if I want to listen to Spotify on another platform, it'll show up on my phone sometimes."
"I had had Spotify Premium for about 6 years now. It's great to access any music I want. However, occasionally I find some songs from artists are not listed. Otherwise, great access to music off-line and online. And brilliant for building playlists. Although I'd like to combine varios artist's full albums into one play list."
"Great and reliable on my Pixel but less through Google Home. Not quite sure how this is true but this app worked better when my Google Home was connected to my old iPhone than it does with my new Pixel...the app display gets ""stuck"" on the first song I play via my Pixel to the Google Home. If music is playing through the Google Home first and I open the app on my Pixel, the app crashes."
"Solid app experience and design. Intermittently pauses or stops playing music. I have a 5G device (Note 20 Ultra) and pretty tech savvy; cache was cleared, and along with battery power throttle work around. Re-installed app followed support threads on all remedies. I am a paying subscriber but never experienced this with free Pandora service why guys? - As I am writing this it stopped after 4+ tracks of music - please note 4 bars on 5G."
"the app is great with premnium, which is honestly a little too over priced. It has quite a few glitches. as im writing htis to pass time, i couldnt shuffle my playlist, i would tap the shuffle button, and nothing would happen, so im reinstalling it right now hoping it will fix. Great app, just lower the price on premnium."
It wont play my liked songs but it will play unliked songs. Im on the preimuim and it just doesnt make any sense. Please make it so even if its behind on updates it still plays more than 6 to 8 seconds of the songs please. Thanks
"I love this app,but I've faced the problem. When I want to open the Artist's page on my tablet there is 'Something went wrong' message with 'Try again' button on the bottom of the page and the information can't be shown even after clicking the button . It's superuncomfortable.So please fix it:))"
The app is crashing everytime I open it. Its been quite long I'm using Spotify n I never faced such problems before. Except this the app has great song collection every genre every language. Just is the crashing issue would be solved it would be great.
All good. UI is great. Features are great. We can have all kind of musics. But the ads are too long and frustrating
"Up until now (4 years of usage), the UI can still get confusing. My sister signed up with my Spotify family and asked how to navigate and I have to tell her to watch some YouTube videos for it. Would have given a 5"
"Spotify is brilliant, never looked back after downloading this, not only good with music you love, but also once it gets to know you, with the music or mixed albums its creates for you. I still use the free version as it suits my needs at this point, I always suggest it to everyone as it really is very good... i promise you wont be disappointed..."
Adding songs to personal play lists from what's playing instead of like button could be a simpler and more convenient option on the display screen while listening. Not a complaint. Just an idea. Enjoying the APP very much and I listen almost every day.
"Impressive library, slick design, reasonable sound quality...2nd day of usage, 'now playing' display got stuck, could change what was listened to but had to close and reopen to update display...really put me off paying, shame."
nice and clean UI. smooth interface to use. simplistic and convenient. everything one needs from and app thats meant to soothe you by music.
"Great music platform for sharing and listening to music, just one thing, the premium, you have to pay to listen to music offline, it would be fine to go like five quid but it's ten so yea"
"Premium user here, taking 1 star off because the quality of music can be improved I think + the standard volume of music I have turned on ""equal"" loudness for all songs but still some are extra quiet and then the next song becomes extra loud lol Maybe I'll give Youtube Premium a try when I get sick of Spotify, eh? ü§£üôà"
"Two things that have been long-term issues and havent been fixed: the hide song button shouldnt be the 2nd option its absurd and it wastes so much of my time because i want to add songs to a playlist and accidentally press it, just put it anywhere else but not at the top. Second issue is a glitch incurred by moving a track from the upcoming ones into the queue, for some reason when sliding down again it's stuck on top. I still love spotify but i think this should be fixed"
Works better than youtube music: more intuitive and complete controls such as sleep timer and lockscreen controls that actually work. More limited but better audio quality library of songs and podcasts.
Would have loved to have higher quality FLAC audio files. UI is easy to use and understand and the playlists are really well made. Could do with a new UI since this one has been on for quite some time now and its showing its age...
I really like it when spotify makes a playlist suitable for my jams! Its like decades of music in one app! The reason i give only 4 is that its lacking of what i want a feature that enables to disregard a playlist after not listening to it for a long time. In all spotify app is amazing and good!
"Your app is good for music listening and provides a very satisfying experience while using it. But I find a problem that you are not providing your app own equilizer, the people who are using Real me, Vivo like brand phones cannot adjust their bass or treble according to their comfort.. So I hope that you will add it soon as it is possible.. All the best#spotify"
"While I enjoy the app overall I find certain aspects a PITA. Things like settings changing after updates. Download tracks not being there a week later. I'm sure there are other things going on but as the app designers know, who has the time to track all the craven moves."
"Aside from being the most convenient music app in terms of ease of access - available on every platform ever - the app performance/UX is pretty bad for a paid premium app which isn't cheap. Navigating the app feels laggy/buggy. Trying to login has lots of issues; it sends a login link to the app which is ""valid for 4 hrs"", but immediately after it says ""link expired"". I can't even reset my password with the app... UPDATE: The live chat support on the web was very helpful & quick"
I feel as though spotify Is consistent with the quality in sound volume output. I also like the random and most hot songs that are mixed. Spotify also has an easy way to share and save playlist. Thank you spotify. I enjoy sound cloud just as much. They both have their quirks.
"I like Spotify, it's unfortunate that there are quite a few albums I like that they don't have. And I would like to delete songs and/or albums I have recently listened to."
Works great. Minor bugs but constantly updated. Only issue is it's 2021 and phones have gotten considerably bigger. Be a lot cooler if some buttons were moved around to make it easier to create playlists and add songs to favorites. Just to do general things
"Great! The only thing missing is a ""Don't like"" button so I can get rid of song suggestions I'm not interested in or songs and ganres I don't want to listen to anymore."
"Amazing user experience. The app is well optimized. However, I do wish they would add higher audio quality options above 320kb/s like other Tidal or Amazon Prime Music. Overall great app!"
Please bring a GUI for large wide auto screens. I have it in vehicle and the display is not designed for such systems. Very hard to navigate and select.
"It's great, but lacks key MP3 features. I love playlists, Bluetooth to the car, external speakers etc. I just wish it would play *my* files: music I've composed, custom home mixes, audio drama files. And yet due to this ONE glaring fault it makes things irritatingly difficult (swapping equipment, plugging in memory sticks and the like). If you would just fix *this* - and we know you can - making it so I can integrate *my* own files into my playlists, Spotify would be the perfect audio app!"
"I use spotify almost daily to listen to any music I can think of, I dont think there's been a song that I havent been able to find so far. Really good app!....... The free version is quite annoying mind with all the adverts and not being able to rewind songs or skip more than 6 songs an hour, but for free its good."
"The app content is quite good.. but there's a bug.. Whenever I try to touch the 3 dots for any song (to share), the app freezes and then only way out is to force close it. Please improve this for Android."
"It works good and dandy when it works, sometimes the coding gets janky. Consistant through premium. Expect reinstall every 3 months or so if you listen regularly because without the quick loading and snappy experience it's just moot trying to relax. Downloading is a good idea for playlists"
"I like a lot of things about this app, much bigger selection than I had suspected. However I do not understand why it frequently stops playing. That is very annoying to me. Is that normal? Do I have a defective phone? If it happened more often I would have to quit it. Be nice if it would work more consistently, get rid of Sirius radio."
"I really like the app, but there is one problem. I really like using the Recommended songs feature, because it shows me new songs! But, lately, it's been acting up; it shows 5 songs that I already have in my playlist (they're from different albums, so it's understandable), but after I hit refresh, it either just gives me two songs, or it just says there was an error. Then, I keep hitting the refresh button until it shows me something, but I only get one song I don't know, and I don't know why"
App is great and worth the trouble of buying premium. One thing I wish out of the UI is to be able to remove songs from playlists oncurrently playing page so when a song I don't like anymore is playing I don't have to go out of my way to search or scroll through the playlist to find it and remove it. Otherwise great app and great service just pay the artists more
"I am giving Spotify for Android a four-star rating, because of this one reason. I am a blind Android operating system user and the latest few versions of Spotify have not been able to show the follow button when you want to follow an artist when you're using either talkback or voice assistant for Samsung devices. can we please get this fixed for all of us blind Spotify users Apple's product works just fine. Meaning the Spotify for iOS. Again please get this fixed and I will change my rating to 5"
"Overall I enjoy the app, but some things can be improved: -> the playlist category should have an option to just show your own playlists (including the downloaded and not downloaded ones). -> there should be an additional category for the downloaded songs, that you haven't 'liked' ! This would be really useful, because often when I use the download button on an album, it doesn't automatically 'like' every song so those songs won't show up in the 'liked songs' category."
"Look, don't get me wrong. I do like Spotify, it's just that it's dumb how you need premium to listen to a certain music on mobile, but on pc, you don't need premium. If you use your phone a lot, I recommend just downloading music from MP3Juices and play them on your phone's music library."
"Before I bought Spotify premium, there were a bit too many ads! I would always get like 3 ads that you could never skip and then the 10 second ad outro. But since I got premium, the app is amazing! The only problem is, when you add new songs in new playlists from the little + button in the music folder, you add one song and you go back to the Start. It's very annoying. Overall, I definitely recommend this app!"
The only thing that annoys me about the app is when you dont have premiuim you get ads and i wouldnt mind this if it wasnt the same add three times in a row one after the other then it plays like 4 songs then the same ad again three times.
"Great, but the radio stations seem hit or miss. Also the search for podcasts is not intuitive."
"This is a good app with good texture smooth and quiet interesting, but adds omg what can I say about them, soo many adds I am just fed up with it, but I can't use any other app instead of this becuase of its too good texture. They randomly play adds in which they promote themselves only by recommending us to buy premium version of this app, like come on just decrease the quantity of these adds. Rest everything is fine."
"I love the minimalistic design of this app. And also I love how this app makes me a good playlist everydayüíñ Edit: I know that ads is a normal thing, but I think its a bit too much now."
"All the music you could want and more in one place. The ads are however quite intrusive, obnoxious and repetetive."
"It is the beste music streaming service! Although it's not always as fast and the UI on mobile devices could be a bit better, the UI on desktop devices is amazing! Managing your library is easy and I like that you can add your own picture for your playlists. The music library of Spotify itself is also very large compared with others!"
"I only have the free version. I'm not the most technologically gifted person. You can only skip 6 songs in an hour so if your trying to build up a library by skipping songs you've already like, you're screwed. The commercials seem to go on forever as well."
Amazing selection of great music and great categories. Intuitive and easy to use. Excellent App!!
"It's a very good app, the only thing I don't like is the ads, often I will hit the watch an ad for 30 minutes ofnad free music button and I will have to watch like 3 ads, not 1."
Very good except you have to pay money to listen to free music but the catch is you have to download songs to listen without wifi which is annoying because Apple music just let's you buy the song and you have it forever no downloading required
Not a premium member so if I want to listen to music while out and about then it eats up mobile data which is annoying adds come up quite a bit which is annoying as well but other than that the app is solid to use
"It's a really good app... but you have got to chill on the Ads! I mean, I understand that you need the support or whatever but it's a little too much. Just saying, you people probably don't understand how annoying it is, to start hearing that one song you know, getting the vibe and then you loose all of your motivation cause of these ads. Believe me it is really really annoying. Hope you will fix this quickly! Don't take it to personal, it's just a word of advice!"
Best app ever just it have few problems like the ads come like 2 in a row and it reminds you to make it premuim or u will get ads in every 4 songs and the other thing is takes more space in pc and it also automatically logs u out whenever you dont use it for 1 and a half week üòÖ so thats all problems are üòÄüòÅüòÄ
Love the app but recently it stops playing fter every 3-4 songs. And I have to restart the app to play again. I can't control the play button with my widget anymore.
RADIO RESHUFFLE FEATURE ~SUGGESTION~ I find my radio algorithm is too strict and I get the same songs a lot over different radios. I think a small algorithm reshuffle option/button for each radio would be an awesome addition.
"Been running into quite a few songs that I can't get, but still very pleased with selection. I don't know if its glitched out, but I seem to be stuck somewhere between regular and premium spotify. Re-insall fixed it"
"I love this app. I have had it since 2017 and it has treated me well. But its called a ""LIKED SONGS"" Playlist. If I didn't click the little heart button, dont play that song on that playlist."
"Great for audio, but i have visual issues. Moving from iOS, Android gets more features but less UI Polish. Liking a song doesnt update on my G8X, and lots of little thingd make listening great but interacting off."
"I like this app very much because there a lot of songs here (including some Cdrama and Kdrama songs) but the problem is that the lyrics are not in romanized form, the Chinese, Korean and Japanese,etc., songs should have the lyrics romanized. Kindly get into my issue and solve it quickly üòä"
i really love this app i've been a loyal customer but can you please move the shuffle & repeat buttons back to where they were on the front omg.. they're so hidden in that corner ~more options~ button i really thought somehow i'm not premium anymore. these buttons are more important than the like and ~get rid~ buttons. also will you please let us upload cover images via app not just via pc?
I give Spotify 4 stars only because it gives you quite a lot of ads but not some much that you get really angry. Also if you want to listen to one song in general you have to get premium then you can do that or you have to make a whole playlist with different songs too. You can also think of this as a positive or a negitive as Spotify tends to switch you onto a totally different playlist. I like this as I can find different songs that I never knew of. But overall Spotify is a great app.
"for the past few days my music hasn't been playing, I've deleted the app and got it again and I've restarted my phone and checked wifi and all that but it just won't play even when I click the play button or if I choose a different song"
"My go-to song app. Easy to use and good UI. Two negatives: No modern looking widget yet, current looks outdated. Sometimes the ""Now playing"" screen is not shown for the user but clicking the screen acts like it is the current view; its a bug."
"Simply the best, no other option than rating 5 star but reduced 1 star for too much annoying ads, initially there were 1 or 2 but now there are at least 3 half minute ads which totally ruins the mood otherwise its the best"
"Have been using this app for years. I've had premium for quite awhile as well. I truly love Spotify. Other than the constant UI changes üòÇ this app is great. 4-stars because they just allowed ads within podcasts even though I have premium. Really, really disliked that."
"This app has been my favourite music player for a long time! And I still love it till now. The reason why I gave it a 4 out of 5 though is because sometimes when I play a song and pause it, it'll still continue to play the song even when the play button shows that it's paused. It'll also continue playing it even when I left the app. I don't think its because of my device since I've used it with other devices and the same problem happens, its not often though. This causes me to panic everytime."
"Spotify is my main music app and I use it quite frequently. I dislike when an add comes on saying ""click to watch an add and receive 30 minutes of add free music"" and I click to watch the add and it goes away so I have to keep listening to adds every other song."
"Would be 5 but over heated & crashed my phone a few times , working on PC & Android , tiny button to chose speakers / Bluetooth / cast-audio is very effective if you haven't found it your missing out ."
"love it. however, it's not a rare occasion that the app just forgets what i downloaded, i like to have playlists and artists' songs downloaded and it's really annoying to have to tap the download button on all of them every month or so."
Spotify: watch this add for free add free music! Me: okay that would be cool. *Clicks watch button* Spotify: plays add and promptly plays 3 more. Me: hmmm that's not add free. Spotify: (not long later) plays 3 more adds. Me: ugh liers lol
"Best cross platform app yet. What i like most is I go anywhere, my songs are available, PC, mobile, TV. Only thing I miss about it is Play Next button."
It's great until you hit ads. Decent app for music. I had expected that this popular app would be definitely equipped with sleep timer. Pls add sleep timer.
"Everything is fine, I just don't like how it adds suggested songs to my playlist. If I had a button for turning it off that would be great."
one of the best app for music. One disadvantage is need to increase or decrease volume pressing the button in phone. add feature for volume adjustments in touchscreens using Spotify
"I would rate it 5 stars. But there's so many ads. Luckily they let you listen ad free if you watch a few ads, but sometimes I click on the button and it still gives me ads after I LITERALLY CLICKED ON THE BUTTON. PLEASE FIX üòêüòê"
"First of all the UI is great, but some features like showing songs in the queue before the current song and also a feature to add a song right next to the current song with the queue staying intact by going down one step. Overall the application is great. Please look if the above mentioned features could be added. It would be great!"
"Excellent music streaming/downloading (if you're a premium subscriber) app. There is a slight learning curve with the UI, but it's not the be all end all. I switched to Spotify after GPM shut down earlier this month and I'm very happy so far with the service. The only downside I've encountered to date is, due to the fact that I live in Quebec, Canada, I'm unable to take advantage of the 3 months free promotion. This is not the fault of Spotify, it's because of the provincial laws."
"This is a very good music app. I would have gave it 5 stars but I dont like the whole 6 skips an hour. If you guys at spotify could maybe turn that 6 into a 12 or give us non-premuim users a unlimited skip count or maybe add it in so we can watch ads to refill our skips, that would be awesome. But great app OVERALL."
This is one of the best apps on my phone. But I wish their is offlin music too.i think a download button for every song could help. Please accept my request and apply download button for every song.. thanks!
"There's this new thing, where Spotify suddenly stops playing in the background until I unlock the phone. And I refuse to give it permission to constantly use as much battery as it sees fit, if such a thing would be a solution, since that hasn't been necessary ever before. There seems to be a pattern of insanely poorly designed functions in this app. Unfortunately, I have been using it for so long, I won't bother having to change to another service. Jokes on me, I guess."
"You know what Spotify needs? A feature to look up lyrics with one button. Just redirecting to the browser and entering ""lyrics"" into google. Or even better, like shazam or soundhound fully integrated but thats only slightly better but obviously a lot more difficult and expensive to do so really not neccesary."
It's a really awesome app and has amazing playlists for any kind of music. Would totally recommend it. Although it does have ads but they too have some good beats. Most of the time they put 3 ads and then let you stream music for quite a while üòÇ
"We need the 'friends activity' on the phone version of the app. Other then that, love the app but it's quite buggy sometimes and the design could be improved."
"It is an awesome app. Provides best recommendations and music updates that suits your peesonality. However, the only problem is the advertisements that are repeatedly broadcasted."
"Its great and all but when it randomly plays a song out of the playlist which they call ""suggested song"". It ruins the mood. Also, a joke, the ads will pop up after listening to a song when the free trial ran out making the vibe interrupted. And then, the ad will talk about interruptions...like Wth ._."
"Great app! I like to discover new music with it, but I find it can be hard to find new artists outside of your algorithm. I would also enjoy if you guys could develop the group sessions a bit more. It's a great concept, I truly like it, but there's quite a lot of bugs. Thank you for this app tho üé∂"
"Like button sometimes doesn't work, I don't know if it reflects to my Likes when it does not do the animation on tap or not. Kindly fix that."
"The app got worse. The notification bar no longer updates as songs change. I have to go back to the app to actually see which song is playing. Along with loop and shuffle buttons being locked behind Premium, this app is not going in the right direction."
"App is cool and awesome but now it has a sort of problem. Lyrics are not coming properly,when line is sung after some time that line's lyrics are comin and it is becoming quite irritating. Please look at this problem.Please look that if song is not in English or it is in other language like Korean or Japanese,it should have proper romanised lyrics including original lyrics. Other things are awesome in app. I Love it‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
U can turn off the songs u might like it's just a lengthy process u have to press the hide button heaps and after a while they will go away the only thing i dont like is the fact u now have to watch ads overall Spotify is a great app and I recommend it to anyone who wants to stream music on the go
"Can you please add some features in the next update. I think there should be a reset button named home reset some where in the setting. Recent played, made for you with no daily mix and for fans of with selected artist of the user should be added. Thx"
"It's absolutely amazing app just that there are many ads. And if u talk about premium not everyone can buy it and specially a teenager like can't, so all things are free just the ads are a quite problem but that's ok"
"I've been using this app for quite a while now and it's great I must say until today; it's responding quite slowly and it always say ""Spotify is trying to play..."". I've already uninstalled and reinstalled this app and tried to reboot my phone, and checked my internet connection but it seems like it's the only app in my phone with slow response. What happened? Hoping it can fixed on the next update because I really love this app and subscribed to premium. Thank you so much."
"Overall, I have spotify premium and love it but there are a few things that have taken away that final star: for instance, some songs seem to be zoned and appear on my device as unplayable. I would also really appreciate if there was a constant way to view your listening activity (artists, length of time ect.) And most of the song recommendations don't really suit me or introduce me to new artists. Apart from those things though.... one of my favourite apps"
"If you don't have the premium account, it's just too many ads. And spotify seems to increase their ads ever so often. Apart from that, it's THE BEST app to listen to music and podcasts. They also have amazing playlists to suit every occasion and mood."
"Great app to be honest, why 4 stars? Well simply because there aren't every song in the search option! Many songs I can't seem to play on the app... A part from that great app, also the design whereas it's on your smart TV, phone pc or tablet."
"Good but has a serious sort issue where new music routinely doesn't show in playlists without a lot of shuffling. Songs tend to freeze or less ck up the app when moving up or down in the playlists or adding to a queue when a playlist is running - i.e. have 39 songs in a list, attempt to queue one way down in the list, spotify crashes or the playlist does. Requires clearing cache and/or reinstall every time."
"App needs to be improved technically. At screens, there are no loaders at times and user remains stuck that something is supposed to happen and then leaves the app. Also the how syncing works and how one can link number or email or Facebook to one needs an easier UX. I ended up having two accounts."
"Very good however I feel the ui could use some basic quality of life upgrades on both the consol and mobile apps. I'd also love if songs with ""behind the lyrics"" had a like a karaoke option with just lyrics. Simple recommends however even if they never came i love Spotify and can't see me changing anytime in the near future"
"When is Spotify going to let us add multiple songs from one playlist to another, cause the way it is , it's not good takes to long to build a playlist."
"Spotify, why is a 'download all' still not an option. For someone like me who has new phone and has saved quite a lot of albums it's quite unconvenient to download each album seperately. Sincerely, a Spotify User"
"This is one of the best music app ever !!! The premium membership help us with add free distraction and offline download music anytime, without internet. This is suitable best for R&B and HIP HOP music. Though others category can also be available for listening . The reason for giving 4 star because it's loudness is good but not best if it's being listened through ordinary headphones.. Under settings, the streaming music is available for very high quality, though it should be upgraded further."
"Auto Playlists of local content are quite off the tangent, y'all mix amapiano, hip-hop, afropop, gqom, afro house, jazz, maskandi etc in the same auto-generated Playlist I.e. song or artist radio for South African content. There's massive room for improvement there, otherwise good job on the other stuff. Ooo, and keep the followers of playlists anonymous, that's üëå"
"I'm gonna start with what disappoints me. The lack of social integration is so shameful just because what could obviously be. The session beta is gonna flop if you can't invite WITHIN the app. Overall however, Spotify has been quite flawless in streaming my music."
"I have been w/Spotify for a couple of years now. I love making my own playlists to suit my mood. The price is right, too. I'd be lost w/out my tunes! Music makes my blood flow."
"Every time I surf through mix, find myself with amazing songs, instrumental and regional musics. Though Adds are quite harrashing ,just make em less ... But one has to deal with it if u don't have premium..."
"Almost perfect! With premium family plan, i dont have to worry about ads. The ui is intuitive and a like the personal playlists. The only suggestion is that they should have a built in equalizer. I used to have one but now i dont"
Would be helpful if it were more easy to play your music without having the shuffle play on . Cant quite figure out how not to have it on shuffle other than that the app is awesome üôèüî•
"The new UI (on all platforms) is the best in comparison. About the performance, well its getting better every second week (by minor updates - which might bother some people but I find it appropriate) just a little bugs here and there.. and that one star I won't be giving you because of the subscription prices which I can't really afford and also I think its not practical.. but seriously man reduce the price a little bit.. otherwise u know I like this app so much.. keep it up.."
It has most of the songs I'm looking for. I really dislike the fact that it adds songs I'm not looking for. Premium is overpriced. You should be able to set a button- = ( manual add ) = = ( recommend ) = but the add for 30 minutes ain't a bad deal
An awesome app to use with good UI and playlists. But there are many popular songs missing in indian version. Once they put it back the ratings are 5 starsüåü
"I say 4 stars because the amount of skips you get when you're not paying just seems like not quite enough, which may be on purpose to push people to get premium. However, I am a huge fan of Spotify. I listen to it all the time for basically every occasion and activity. I use it to fall asleep, to get my dance on, cleaning, playing with my kids, helping THEM get to sleep. I've never searched for a song and not found it on here either, which is awesome. Not enough characters for my review üôÉ"
"Overall I love this app for listening to my favourite music and podcasts. HOWEVER, I am quite disappointed that I can't use the lyrics function (I have reinstalled a few times but the mobile version still doesn't work both on my phone and ipad)."
"Very good app, useful, but for GOD'S SAKE just stop it with the ads! So many ads. I pressed a button to cancel an ad and I got 3 ads in a row."
"If you are used to ads, then using it for free might not bother you at all. Still, if you want to used it continuously like me, getting yourself a premium is a smart choice considering the price is quite reasonable."
"Hello developers! I'm enjoying the app so far. However, can you please bring back the alphabet scroller (or alphabet side bar or whateverit is you call) that allows to go from A to S or from B to F quickly. It may be a small thing but will really help in the overall experience. Also, it'll help if you reply to this. Thank you very much!"
"Spotify premium works well. However, currently I am experiencing some small bugs. Esspecially when I try to use it with spotify connect, built into my Denon receiver"
"Its fantastic, love getting to hear all my music all the time in a format that lets you find whatever you need. A few bugs with the UI here and there, kind of irritating; but other than that, solid 4 stars. 5 stars if they squash the bugs."
"I mean its good yeah, I mostly use it on pc because I can replay the songs and pick what song I want... Im using it on mobile rn and the only problem I have with it is that it doesnt have the shuffle or repeat button on the screen of the song Im playing, actually my main problem is just not being able to repeat my songs, I tried updating my spotify but nothing worked. Instead of the shuffle and repeat button, all I see is a heart and the ""--"" button that can get rid if songs I dont like...."
"Good most of the time but tons of bugs when using it with my google home devices; songs will freeze, pause/play very quickly, or just the straight up wrong song would be played when using voice commands to play a song"
"Nice app with a nice, functional design. It can be hit or miss with discovering new music from artists I follow or discovering new artists similar to ones I like. Their algorithm seems to suggest the exact same stuff over and over again and doesn't seem to refresh often. Also, with there was a section for new music ONLY from the artists I follow."
It's the best app just because everyone uses it. The UX has a lot of janks lately. And the Podcasts section needs to be completely separate from the music section.
"I'm a huge fan of Spotify and have been a premium user for years now. I really, really wish I could turn off shuffle as the default playback mode. I've had too many mornings ruined by listening to what I thought was a bad album. Only to realise Spotify was playing random tracks from it. Please put in an option to change this!!"
"I wish that on phone you can keep repeating the song just like on a PC. Also when the song ends i wish to hear it again but there is nl button so i can go back, but overall it's a good app."
"The experience is vet good , but only thing missing was the lyrics . We can't get every song's lyrics . And it makes quite little bit unsatisfied Please improve this and it will reach greater heights."
"Overall my favorite app. But there used to be shown how many songs in a playlist, I don't know why did they remove this feature. Also I wish there would be a ""skip to next episode"" button on lock screen while playing a podcast. Now I have to unlock the phone, go to the app and then skip it or push ""15 secs"" button until the episode ends. Additionally 1 hour for sleep timer is not sufficient. I sometimes switch to other apps with 2 hr sleep timer option."
"Spotify is the best music streaming app ever.. The UI,recommendation all good. Some things need to improve - Proper lyrics - in group listening sessions add chat in it.. It will be cool.."
"I can't login to Spotify with Facebook in my new Samsung Galaxy F41. I think it has synced with Samsung account. @SPOTIFY TEAM, please resolve this issue for me. Please suggest me if require any action from my end. Edited: Issue resolved, thanks to Team Spotify."
It's a great app for music. It has an extensive library and it's improving in Hindi and Punjabi. Amazing radio and it's shuffling is very intuitive sometimes. Pro version makes it easy to listen to songs online. A lot could be done to make it more user friendly for the driver in cars.
"Seems like the recent bugs were fixed at last. :) The one thing I would like to improve with the app, as it is now, would be a better UI for editing playlists..."
"I love this app and use it all the time, it's easy to find songs and has great sound quality. My only problem is that sometimes the songs lag and when I switch between songs it'll stay on the first song I played and the play/pause button doesn't work at times."
"Price is not overly expensive sound quality and design is ok, too complicated to go to home page to use settings, some bugs here and there but overall it's good enough"
"The product is excellent; brilliantly curated playlists to suit every mood and taste that I've ever had, and with a good range of music; not just the mainstream stuff. 0.1% of the time I can't find the song I'm looking for as it's not licenced here, but that is getting better. A few minor bugs here and there but nothing that can't be fixed with a hard restart."
Really enjoy listening to entire albums again! Have also enjoyed some of the suggested play lists based on my listening habits. I wish the format was more intuitive/easier to navigate. Found a tutorial on line that helped. Otherwise I am very happy!
"I just updated the app but I can't filter my playlists. The ""Filters"" button doesn't even react. Please fix this bug, thank you"
Love the design and everything. It would also be cool tho to be able to put playlists etc into folders and change the picture of playlists as well as to be able to see what my friends are listening to atm not only in the desktop version but also in the mobile version. THANKS <3
"Only 4 because I'm new to this whole digital streaming services. Idk if I truly like this format and having to pay a monthly premium for more content when I already had a large library of my own music I purchased, like and enjoy through the years. Jury is still out. If you have a large ""paid for and acquired"" library this and other ""streaming"" service may not be for you or I. Still exploring, still on the fence!"
Sometimes have issues with the app getting UI getting stuck on a song. The audio is fine and continues like it should but the controls and the image get stuck.
"Good app. The only issue is that when I click on a certein track, it often gives me another track, made by the same artist. Its a big problem for me cuz I love electro, only electro, and the artists that I like also make songs with vocals, which I don't like,but I get them quite often instead of what I intended to happen"
"I love this app but there should be a button where you can turn of ""spotify adding songs"" because i hate when im trying to listen to happy music and then I randomly get a sad song."
"This app is an absolute banger ngl . Jus the issue that I'm been facing since last month is the ""SETTING"" button has been disappeared from the home page . I'm really not able to find the SETTING button as well as my profile option üëÄ. Please look on it ‚úåüèø"
1. UI and UX are great .. but don't have my fav. music.. so it sucks for me even with premium 2. With added artists increased my stars from 2 to 4 3. Rated four because you cant keep tracks downloaded for more than a day with internet on
"Version 8.5.79.1061 the ""find in liked songs"" and ""find in playlist"" buttons are too deep in the menus!! In the previous version of the app, there was a permanent search bar in my liked songs and in my playlists. Please bring this back!!! Searching is something used all the time and i dont want to menu dive to find it!!"
"The app is stuck on one song on the now playing screen even when I change songs, and quits playing when i go out from the app. Edit: issue fixed for now, awesome! Now to wait since quite a few of my songs are greyed out and unavailable."
"Good app, just about every song I could ever want to listen to. Premium is so worth it! Bugs are fixed quickly."
Alot of great features and I've found lots of new music through it but it is really buggy and crashes all the time. Well designed but just too buggy
"Great service, have been using for years. Just wish there was a way to download my entire music library with the touch of a button, I don't have a ton of phone storage for nothing!"
"Well, I love Spotify and use it on a daily basis. Now, first we could hit the like button on the songs which we like, but now I am not able to like a song. So I had to make a whole playlist named - Liked songs and then go to the three dots on each song and then add to playlist. And I am able to like the 'This is __________' kind of playlists but not the other ones like, 1989, Voicenotes, basically, the albums. So I had to create the whole album playlist on my own. I need help with this please."
"BRING IN THE LOSSLESS QUALITY SONGS!! Tidal seriously sounds so much better. With your UI and playlists, if your sound can match Tidal, that would be a dead app. We have been waiting too long. Being it already jeez"
Spotify Is a really good App that gets you going when you hear the music. I have had Spotify for awhile now and I really enjoy It. All the playlist you can make and Its so good because you can also listen to music while offline. üëçüòÅ I would recommend this App to any age. One thing that is quiet annoying is that well yes ADDS super annoying ads. But you can just listen to playlist and then not be distracted by them. I listen to Spotify whenever I'm at school or when I have spare time. Recommend
"I would give it 5 Stars but there's no way to thumbs down or stop it giving you a song you hate again. You hide it in one discovery playlist and it appears days later in another discovery playlist. There's a like songs button, why not a dislike button to filter the rubbish like other apps have?"
"6oct20: Finally there is Landscape mode on android. Song availability and Radio has improved quite a lot since the first use but the amount of adverts is just too much but okay for a free app. Old: Spotify is okay. Nothing to dislike in Spotify in particular, but yes, JioSaavn's deeper integration with my service provider (Reliance Jio) is obviously better (JioTunes)."
"I had this problem on my Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) then upgraded to Galaxy S20 where I would click next track or seek through a song, it would be very delayed. Sometimes the animation of the album cover when attempting to play the next song would go forward, then backwards quickly, then actually play the next song. Problem didn't occur for first month after upgrading then started happening again. This bug ruins the user experience and smoothness of the app."
Overall great service but they introduce bugs every few updates. Then you gotta wait for the next one for it to be fixed for the bug to go away. Why keep changing it? Pick a bug free build and stick with that one
"[Edit: They replaced the widget] The recent updates regarding the UI and the widget removal were absolutely horrible decisions, and I am really hoping that the backlash you seem to be getting about it makes you rethink it, and return it to how it was before. The widget was something I used everyday, and having it gone is quite an inconvenience, as many others have also said."
"In the newest update there are quite a few problems, and I list them below: (device: galaxy note 9) 1. Spotify is playing music, however the bar is hidden in the notifications, so I can not pause it! 2. Spotify is playing a song, lets say it is A, however it shows that Song B is playing. And again I can not pause it! Its indeed annoying. The only way to get rid of issues mentioned above is force closing the app :| Please solve üôè"
"Its great, except for your playlist randomization. It is quite weak. For a playlist with a couple hundred songs, i think it would be great. But for all my liked songs, the randomization is lack luster. Other than that, great experience!!"
I love spotify but your latest update has really bummered up the app. When I want to play a new track it takes at least a minute before it plays. Quite annoying. Other issues include it stops playing when connected to a device using bluetooth. Also annoying.
I love Spotify. It's a great app. I can find most of the music I usually look for. Communication with Shazam is wonderful and quick. It would be great to be able to find songs by typing parts of the lyrics like YouTube does. I prefer Spotify over YouTube music and moreover Amazon music.
"Normally excellent, but for a few days before the last update and now following it, the track playing cannot be stopped with the play buttons at the bottom or on the notifications or on lock screen. Before the latest update the only way to stop it was to restart the phone. Now swiping up on the open apps acreen kills it."
"I love spotify, this app.... not so much. It's starting to freeze up songs and not continue playing after a sht while. This requires me to restart my phone to get ihe app to work. Spotify is a great service but the app is unresponsive at best with the new interface. Hopefully this issue can be resolved."
"I really enjoy the app but it can be annoying at times. Lately evertime i try to listen to my liked songs it only play ""suggested songs"". I can't listen to my liked songs. And they add song to your playlists even if you have more than their limit for how little you van have. Yeah the adds can be annoying too but theu do need a way to make mony. I just think oh ts a little excesive considering the fact thatvthey make mony off of premium accounts they could have less adds. But hey its free muic."
Awesome! Thanks for having it in India! But why cant I see live lyrics button on the songs I play? I know that if the lyrics are available then only there would be an option but I generally noticed it's not available on almost all the songs I played irrespective of the language. Any updates on this?
It's all good. But it would be better if I can play all my downloaded songs from all of my different playlists and albums in one single play button. Thanks!
"I just downloaded this and it seems pretty good except i can't add songs i search for to a playlist. I tap the plus button and nothing happens, please fix this!"
The queue button has been moved out of the now playing screen and is hidden in the context menu. I use the queue feature all the time so it's annoying to have it moved and hard to access. Would be keen to have it easy to access again.
The app needs a reachability redesign. The 3 dot menu which has all the options is impossible to reach with one. Picked a subscription last week. Good discovery once you find sutable playlist.
I enjoy the app but it crashes often. 4 starts for the UI and user friendliness.. would have been 5 stars if I didn't have to uninstall and reinstall to fix the crashes.
"The UI is smooth for this app is smooth and easy to use not flashy and buggy also it is not laggy, though sometimes I encounter bugs and need to restart the app to rectify it, the ads can get irritating sometimes but that is something we all have to work with, overall experience is good"
"Wonderful app I love it, literally use it everyday. Just a nuisance with the ads as well as having limited skips if you don't have premium. Besides that, would recommend."
I do like using the app very much but from past few days I'm facing a problem which I've never faced. I accidentally have hit the hide button while listening to a song and now I'm not being able to retrieve the songs back . Ive tried several ways none if which are working . It would be great if you please solve this problem. Thank you !
I think the app is great but the one thing that bothers me is the new search button. I miss how it was when your in your liked songs and you can just search instead of clicking other buttons and then search
"Hey there, just wanna comment on the fact that Spotify quit the ""see who follows your playlist"" interaction, I honestly think this should be available again because I wanna check the friends that follow my playlists and maybe see people who like it if they have the same kind of taste. Kinda annoying it's off now...I would have given a 5 if you fixed this."
"Why can't I swipe right to add a song on the queue with an Andriod? Why are the buttons hidden to 'Find a Song' in the playlist, instead of swiping up to search? The iPhone version allowed these features. I would love to enjoy them on my Android as well."
"Its amazing. I love spotify. But there is one thing wrong tho. For some reason when im at home it works but when i get to school it will sometimes work, but then sometimes it only plays like 10 seconds of the song and then quits. I dont know why. But if you could please fix this that would be great and you will get a rerating of 5 atars from me. Thank you!"
"Highest bitrate Spotify can go with a premium subscription is 320kbps, which is a shame considering all the other great offerings from other streaming services. But the UI and the consequent UX is ways better than any other music app. Features such as Spotify Connect and the Discord integration also make it so much easier to share the music I love. Therefore, despite lack of Hi-Fi, I stick with it."
Really good aside the ads but the one thing missing is having a repeat button or repeat all function as by the end of the playlist it stops but having the repeat all would be nice.
"I like the way recommendations work here, much better than Youtube Music and Apple Music. But it lacks song's lyrics and the user experience for a play queue is bad: sometimes I want to add a song before currently played and it's impossible."
"I have trouble opening ""Artists"" Every time I tap an artist, it says ""Something whent wrong"" and the ""try agin"" button doesn't work. Other than that, no issues!"
"It's great, but it could be 5 stars if you actually get 30 mins of uninterrupted listening when it tells you that you will, instead of just getting ads after every 2 to 3 songs. And the ads aren't able to be skipped. Theyre also quite long (30 to 40 secs). Apart from having way too many ads, it's great."
Significantly reduced functionality from desktop or browser versions. Seems to have issues reconnecting if connection gets lost and requires force stopping the app semi-regularly. 2 years later I have found the above issues mostly fixed and have had spotify premium for a year. Increasing rating from 2 to 4 stars.
"Great app, most songs I like I can find there. Only some 90s songs are not there. A dislike button would be good too for some songs. Might help to get more accurate suggestions."
App is really great and fun to use find it better than others but lately there have been too many Adds which is ruining the fun I understand that u have to show adds but the amount of Adds I get is sometimes frustrating.
Great service but interface still not very intuitive. Queue system is not flexible. Recommendations are also not the best.
"Love the seemless control of music across different operating systems/devices. On Linux based OS (Ubuntu), there are a few bugs where it doesn't sync with my phone sometimes, where the ""currently playing"" music is sometimes different. Still not able to find a fix for that. Totally worth the subscription otherwise!"
"This is the best music streaming service period. The UI is simple and easy to use, the catalogue is extensive, the AI isn't horrible and it is so good for making as many playlists as you want. No other service compares."
"Great app, love the music and podcasts it offers! Only problem is its not super easy to cancel your subscription to premium! Nor apply for a student discount as my college doesnt seem to show up! Im a bit annoyed I got charged for another month just for the fact I couldnt find the cancel button but Its alright."
The application is nice. Sound quality is awesome. Interface is user friendly. The database of songs is quite huge I was able to find pretty old songs as well.
"I would give this app 5 stars but, if you don't have premium youget 1 to 4 adds. Which is quite annoying in my opinion. other then that i find this app amazing an simple to use and listen to the songs you love!"
"Love it. I gave it one star less because the older UI was much more preferable in terms of user friendliness. The current Spotify ""home"" has too much going on and isn't as organised as the older UI. Not a deal breaker but just my personal preference."
"Not a bad app, can be a bit clunky with the UI when navigating. I also got myself into a frustrating ""queue"" loop where I couldn't find a dang ""clear queue"" button..I do have a Pixel there's a decent chance that this is human error."
"Long time user, always excited to see feature updates, very happy. But omg why not built in lyrics support and karaoke mode? And please allow me to not see notifications about new singles only full albums."
"Overall brilliant app convenient and quick (as long as its updated). One suggestion, only a minor thing but small conveniences make big differences. When I had an iPhone that version enabled you to search for a song in the playlist by dragging down, instead of clicking on the three dots to get the option. Put this in the android app!"
Good app. But. Still require some improvement like. There are lots of songs which I search on Spotify but. Don't get that. Songs And. This. App. Show too many ads. For non prime mambers
"Now they got the scroll bar fixed again, but there are still some quirks with the app connecting to other devices. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does. Sometimes it will crash on my phone if I'm playing a song on my PC and try to skip it with the ""remote"" app"
The only reason I'm not giving it a five star is due to the fact that they have too many ads.... It just completely ruins ur experience.....tho if you overlook that fact the app is just awesome.... I've found songs here that aren't there on any other apps .. So totally recommended. It's a good app
"Spotify is a great app. It's functional, aesthetic, and intuitive. I do think it could use more gestures for quicker inputs, like swiping left on a track to queue it up. It also could be more stable; I often have to restart the app on my phone because it has stopped playing."
It's a solid app. The UI could use some tweaking but overall it's decent. I prefer Poweramp's UI. CUSTOMIZATION is the main key.
"Ive been using the app for a long time, and it was pretty good. But there was a bug or glitch which wont let me skip when im out of the app. And if you know the quick acess bar when you slide down yoir phone screen, it didnt show the song, it only said advertisment when a song was playing. Please fix this."
It would be nice if I could get anything to work on this app without an error message popping up. FIX IT! EDIT: Thank you guys for fixing this issue so quickly. It had been frustrating to have an actually good music app not work.
So recently my Spotify isn't letting me play a song if I look it up. I used to be able to look up a song and press shuffle play and skip the songs until I get to the song I want but now this isn't even a shuffle play button so I can't listen to the song that I looked up. I hope they fix it soon
"4/5stars,its perfect for casual, even more than perfecr.The app freaking works even with no internet dye to smart download, nice ui and theme with all the larest tracks, what I think its misaing is lack of loseless music, I knownumber of true audiophiles is minimal in the country and with no access to sites like tidal, spotify is the last option if you dont want to buy tracks album seperately. But as an audiophile I think the app would be best if option loseless streaming was added evn fr extra‚Çπ"
"So, I used to love Spotify alot. And one of the most common things that I would do is search up a singular song and play it, but now I am unable to do so. It doesn't show me the 'shuffle play' button that used to appear, so it has made listening to certain songs extremely hard. Even after reinstalling it still does not show."
"Thr shuffle feature is rather a basic algorithm. Despite having 9 albums in one playlist, you will find time after time the same few songs get automatically chosen. So if you try sorting your playlist into the available headings ie album,newly added artist etc you willl have shuffled your own playlist. Otherwise the songs you played the most get chosen by your spotify shuffle button."
"Great app if you love music, music quality and UI is also great, but if I turn on my MOBILE DATA and then try to listen to music, it dosen't work... Spotify please help........"
"The app does kinda force you to get premium but that's expected. If you are a free user then you'll quickly notice the shuffle play algorithm is soooooo broke. It seems to just play similar songs, I had a 600 song playlist with lots of different artists and it played two Gunna songs back to back and they were the only two Gunna songs. It does this with any artist all the time."
"Spotify is quite better then other music streaming apps I've been using spotify for couple of years and I've seen good updates for better experience, but but the lyrics should be pop up on others screens too and one can customize them like font and colour etc."
I love this app it's just that I can't shuffle my music. When I press the shuffle button right next to the pause button nothing comes up either. Otherwise it's a good app. Highly recommend.
"(05/05/2020): i've always enjoyed using spotify, even without premium, but ever since the last update (or maybe the last two updates) it hasn't been working properly. none of the podcasts i've subscribed to/search for come up - the app always gives me an error message - and the same goes for my episode downloads, which were initially working perfectly. edit (13/08/2020): everything's working smoothly, it got sorted out pretty quick actually (i'm editing this rather late though)."
"The offline mode makes your downloaded songs to suddenly stop, over and over like every 5 minutes. You must play songs with data or wi-fi if you don't want to manually press the play button."
The app interface is quite simple and easy with minimal design but the fact that it contains so many ads ruins the mood and the vibe...u could possibly reduce ads...
"Okay the best experience to have of Spotify without Premium is if you're someone who listens to podcasts, if not the constant ads every few songs can get quite irritable. Using Spotify for podcasts is the perfect balance if you don't have Premium because you can listen to long podcasts along with listening to a few of them in a row then get a 30 second to a 1 minute ad every now and then. Spotify without Premium for Music is Poor, Spotify without Premium for Podcasts is perfectly fine."
It's very intuitive and collection is also good. Just make it's equaliser a little better and make it less ad free. That will eventually generate more listeners.
All's good for me except i wished the music downloaded quicker. Also sometimes i do download the music to listen offline and when i check the following day i have to re-download... Otherwise all is well.
"Great app for listening to and discovering new music. I find the 'recommended music' feature to be way off point sometimes. Also, I suggest when in a playlist, the search function should apply to your playlist for quick selection, not an overall Web search. Love it though"
I listen to spotify on a Samsung Galaxy s8 and when ever I get on a playlist I can't turn off suffle because the two crossing arrows will not appear by the play/pause button and neither does the giant green button at the top of the playlist appear to shut off or turn on suffle please fix this and I'll give it 5 stars
Been using Spotify for quite some time now. Love the app since it provides a wide range of music. The ads are way too frequent and disturb a lot.
I really liked this app üòä it's best app to listen to music all types of music and our language songs also we can get üíØ It's a smooth going app üòâ and we can get our fvt artist new songs or resently released songs hear and it doesn't require full network speed ü§ü‚úåÔ∏è problem is it contains ads I hate ads ü•¥
"Very solid music app, much better than Pandora. My only complaint is that I have to get Premium in order to play any song I want at any time. This wouldn't be a problem if I needed to enter my credit card info to start the free trial. Why do I need to enter my information to get something free? It doesn't quite make sense for me. Plus, why do I only get six skips per hour? The reason I'm skipping is to get to a specific song, so having a skip limit leaves it up to luck. Besides that, amazing app"
"It's quite surprising that Spotify doesn't have Coldplay collection in its wide range of songs. I have always been a huge fan of this app, but disappointed about the fact that they're not providing good music (like that of Coldplay) & rather focusing on regional market to attract new customers."
Using Spotify Premium for a year now and the experience has been GREAT. While comfort and ease of use is top notch but some minor bugs do come up and destroys the experience. It is a hassle if you want to access the EQUILISER. Please DEVs add a shortcut for equiliser in the Play options. Its really annoying to go back to settings everytime I want to change somethings in the equiliser. Overall THE BEST app for streaming online music. Worth every penny for the PREMIUM. P.S Pls address the UI bugs.
"Way Better Now! I am changing my review because you have really worked it all out, a gigantic number of songs are here now which were absent before, still some songs are unplayable, but that is overcomed by the imporoved and fast GUI. #appreciation"
"Sometimes it just doesn't play the songs I want, I click on a song e.g Sweden c418 and it plays lucid dreams by Juicewrld. It's weird and at times frustrating but overall the app works so yeah."
Pretty good and I use it everyday always... but someone tell me why its so damn difficult to disconnect from facebook and delete your account. Like please just have a button in the settings to do this instead of having to go through a bunch of steps on a website.
"Needs clear and easy to use ""like"" and ""dislike"" buttons, needs play position saving for each playlist. Needs also easy private session switch. Otherwise good!"
Edit: the queue button is back and I'm happy now üòÅ Although I don't like how frequently spotify experiments with the UI. Old Review: They removed the easy access queue button and replaced it with a share button. Spotify keeps making non-sensical changes and you have to keep retraining your memory to figure out how to do simple things because it's now hidden in a menu somewhere. Mega upset with this latest change.
"Love it overall, like how you can listen to any song at the click of a button. Don't like how you have a limited amount of fast forward unless you pay monthly fee and no play back."
"I'm a spotify premium user and have been for years. I enjoy the app on a daily basis but have been wanting something ever since I switched from iOS. It's really a minor QOL improvement but makes all the difference, and that is to add the swipe to queue feature, like they have on Apple. When using the queue feature constantly, you realise how much time you spend pressing the triple dot button, waiting for the options to load, then adding to queue. Just add this feature please, it's been years."
This is a great app but when I search songs to go in my playlist I will press the plus button to add a song and it won't work but I can add songs from my recommended list it's really annoying that I cant add songs I search
"Always qui k to find my tunes, plus the quality and selection are pro. I recommend this service to all kinds of people, and they all agree im the man. Thanks Spotify and keep up the good work!"
"Its a great app, but out of nowhere the rewind and fastforward buttons go gray. Also when u play ur playlist it skips through and when u try to press a certain song it just previews it."
Hey team there's a bug that the latest update didn't seem to fix and it's been there for quite some time - when you go to a song radio and you skip ahead a few tracks liking a song doesn't turn the heart green but it still goes into your liked songs playlist. Apart from this I love your recommendations !! Wayyy better than YouTube ! And the UI and lyrics/trivia feature are pretty slick too üíØ ! Can you also create an I'm feeling lucky button in the app that takes me to a new song every click ?
"Pretty awesome app, and the integration with the desktop, web and Google Assistant clients is perfect. 4 stars because when I have bad internet service, it has issues playing albums I've downloaded. It does work if I set the app to offline mode, but it's quite the annoying bug."
"When I click on an artist, I can't click the ""see more"" or ""and more"" button on my mobile. I tried uninstalling and clear cache but it still doesn't work. It have been bugging me for a few weeks now. Please fix it soon."
"Good music library, good UI, remarkably low power usage. Irritating: no easy way (if there is a way at all) to access one's own search history and play history. Search history is there, but truncated at about 8 entries, play history is on the homepage somewhere, intergrated in all the mishmash"
"I'm nothing but happy about this app coming to Russian Google store. Only problem I've faced was that ""the playlist"" button somehow dissapeared from screen of current track. It's very helpful feature in case I want to change my playlist. So that's the reason for 4/5 stars, but I hope it'll be fixed soon, in case it's a bugg ofcüòÖ. And sorry for my English üòÖ"
"In comparison with Yandex music - more power consumption on my Meizu 15. Please fix position of settings icon on main screen - no harmony in desigh. Please add more themes to design, what if I have mental desease about green and want to choose another theme in app. And please think about fonts design, chairs are too bold. Looks like native old android. Not lightweight but light is better by balance."
"Hey is there any way spotify would display the songs other than shown above? Because mine is different. And I can't play the songs other than using shuffle play button.I can't play it in loop, I can't play the songs to my own liking!! Also the add to home screen button is gone."
It's good that you're now giving lyrics with the songs but it needs to be more subtle. You know it's just too bold and seems like an ameture developed that feature out of boredom. Kind of ruining the overall player screen. You could provide lyrics like one line at a time and fading it away when sung. And please don't provide directly on the main screen just have it one click away and also if possible a Full screen album poster while playing. Thank you.
"The fact is, in india there are some other streaming services available like saavan, Amazon music if you have prime subscription, youtube music, gaana etc. And those services have more songs than Spotify thats the fact but if you want really optimized app experience, really good song suggestions, ready made playlist according to your taste in music, and easy to use UI then i would suggest to go with this app. Why do you need Spotify? Its all about suggestions."
The app is great but the fluidity of the app is surely something the developers can improve. It always envies me how iOS users can just swipe in certain directions to do actions like queuing a song or opening up the media controls. Adding those features to Android would be a HUGE Quality of Life improvement.
"Dear developers, thanks for quite stable application. I have few suggestions: 1. White theme / themes based on different colors 2. When you see a playing track on display you could make swipe down to see all songs on playlist, for instance, like it realised in yandex.music Best regards!"
"my Spotify does not work when connected to Wi-Fi. when I log in, it appears that I am offline and the music tracks appear gray. fix it, quick."
"Really loving the app, hip hop collection is decent and quite a bit of variety with the artists as well. But the rock collection is still lacking."
It has now supported with lyrics in quite a good amount of songs.... If they will support every song with lyrics in the app itself then it will be the best app on Android devices for music because it has a vast variety of songs....more than any other app
"I don't like the user experience, i have premium but i dont like the fact that everytime i click off an album it restarts me to the start which is quite inconvenient. I prefer the old 2017 look which was honestly great and the one that i loved the most"
"I'm gonna be honest, I was never a Spotify fan‚Ä¶ but the app has become decent over the years, featuring a lot of, most likely, user-requested features. The only thing I miss is the lyric search function from Apple Music or the sound search from Google Play Music. One thing that could really smoke out the competition would be an Equalizer. Meanwhile I still prefer Apple Music UI: though it has less features and more bugs, I think it's more intuitive."
The app is awesome. load times are quick just like any other app. The only problem I have are finding songs. When I try to search up a song and then the artist name It doesn't pop up but on my PC and TV it does. If you could fix this that would be amazing.
"Recommendations are great. Here I'll go for Pros - Cons: Pros: 1. Recommendations are great 2. UI is also nice and ligh weight 3. Can download music in premium membership. 4. And it syncs with all the signed in device, so u can controll the playback from any device by using the same app. 5. It has really good collection of English albums and solo. Cons: 1. There is no option to download only one song from an Album 2. Smart download is not there (for repeated songs)"
"I have been using the free version and so far it's quite nice, i am not having complains regarding anything like the music or design or anything but i can only listen to songs when i am in the range of wifi and not in case of hotspots that's the only issue i can find. Plzüôèüèª do the needful. Btw love the app.... better than any other music app. üòçüíö"
"I really like Spotify, I've been using it for about 3 years now. It has song recommendations that are relavent to my playlists, it lets me listen as long as I want. I don't have Spotify premium, so ads do interrupt and ruin my vibe quite a lot, but it's fine."
"All over is a cool app, and helpful. But i will give 5 star if u fix the design of ur widgets on the screen, make it more stylish and simple like samsung or apple UI it will be more cooler i think."
"It's a good app, but have glitches that ruin you experience. Like when I connect to my bluetooth speaker it refuses to open for a couple of time, and have to close and reopen to make it work properly. Maybe it's the network problem, but the app closes sometimes unexpectedly. But it has a great variety of songs and so many new artists that I have never heard anywhere, this app does good job. Just fix these glitches. It would be better app."
"Spotify is the top dog of music players, been premium for years and have always relied on it for music, never once failed on me. BUT, where has the queue button gone??"
"In the latest mobile update, I can no longer quickly access the song queue from the playing screen. It has been replaced by a share button which I feel is pointless. Now to access the queue I have to click on the drop down menu and find the button which says go to queue. Please don't fix what is not broken"
Overall good and quite intuitive application. However at the moment no possibility to disable auto-play on bluetooth device connection.
"Just the best music streaming platform out there. They, now, have lyrics of quite a few songs that I missed quite a lot. Just they let users clear their recently played songs/playlist from screen and allow users to change privacy related settings from app itself. Spotify clear lacks quite a few old Bollywood music & Devotional Music albums addition of which would be appreciated. Also, some albums are incomplete (one or more songs are missing altogether)."
"I wondered whether it was best to write this review about the app itself or Spotify as a service, I think we all know Spotify is a great music streaming platform so I will review the app. Realistically, the just works. It's quick, does everything I need it to do, rarely has any issues and it's reasonably easy to use. Spotify Connect is annoying from time to time but it sorts itself out. But, the biggest change I would make is the browse menu, I find it too very cluttered, change this for 5 star"
Mostly good just having an issue with where the queue button moved to. I go into the queue all the time and not having super easy access to it is quite annoying.
"An amazing app but only if you pay. If you do not pay then I am acctualy sorry for you, you can't download playlists, it adds music that you don't want on your playlists, and you can't play serten music when you want it to. I gave it a 4 star because the money you ha e to pay is acctualy quite cheep..."
"Everything is great except adding songs to playlists should be a quicker and easier process, and on Android if you want to queue songs you can't just swipe right on the song, you have to click it and then 'add to queue' which is annoying and time consuming. Otherwise an amazing music streaming experience! I LOVE the 'On Repeat' playlist idea."
"It's my favorite music app , even though it has some flaws it is simply nice the interface and everything is quite nice yet probably the easiest to use,. But I would like it better if it had a history of last played songs queue to play it again when I come back to it . Overall it's probably the most refined out there"
"This is really an amazing app! I downloaded it because i wanted to download songs for my videos on youtube,Then i cant find any download button on the songs i was listening......i would rate this app 5 stars if you fix this.....I really hope that you could notice my suggestion... I just wanted to download music"
"Spotify is pretty good. After the 7 day free trial i was a bit sad becuase i could only play my songs on shuffle unless i payed money which im not doing. Its not a bad app i quite like it. I dont like how you have to pay to get premium though.i also keep finding that spotify will add songs to my playlists, and theu are songs that i dont even like.but there is a wide variety of music and the audio is good. Its farely easy to use and i suggest getting this app if you are into music and podcastsüòä"
Im giving it 4 stars now because in the liked songs menu there used to be a search bar to search for songs now i have to toggle the 3 dots and get to that. Why remove that when it was much more convenient? The app in windows has it but why remove it in android?Its much more of a hassle especially when driving and is distracting and u need to find for the songs in your liked songs or playlist. Maybe have a search bar or a magnifying glass icon that we can quickly tap and search in the playlist.
"Great software, just seems a bit intuitive at times. UI could do with work, but it found every song I ever wanted so far and i am not a young man."
"Great app helps me find the music that fits me, but that 30 minute ad free thing is annoying because you have to stop what you're doing and open Spotify to hit the watch ad button, it would be way better if it was automatic."
The best app for music streaming. Maybe they can improve gestures in the UI (there aren't any gestures) These kind of design things
"This is quite best app for listening songs, but the only things which is bothering is that there are ads. I would rate this app 5 star if they remove these ads on free version too."
it's all good but quite often the autoplay option doesn't work when you search for a song and after it finishes it just stops and doesn't play any song
"The app's been randomly crashing while listening to music, it just stops. Tried restarting phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Even made sure my phone's software is up to date, nothing helped. It was a minor nuisance, but it's become annoying the more often it happens. Pls fix."
Everything is great the only problem is. I want like and remove buttons just next to the song that ways it will make app more user friendly. Trust me spotify people listen to it. Also give flexibility to add in playlist and let users edit your playlist when they download it. Please please just do like button thing. Please
Very high quality music streaming. The podcasts here are also quite interesting and like youtube you can create your own shows and podcasts. There is one thing sometimes it shows no internet even when I am on home Wi-Fi. I have to troubleshoot the app which is quite annoying. Otherwise it is a good app
When I'm playing the drums when I need to make adjustments it always goes to advertisements first by the time I'm done adjusting song is finished. For some reason my drums become unresponsive quite often while using this app for unknown reason have to put phone to sleep then back up to restore the drums function has anyone else experienced that?
It's a very good app for listening to music online. Even though I don't have a membership I can access a lot of songs and play them. There are adds since I am not a member but still it is comparitivlely less than other music apps. Good user experience
"Love Spotify Premium when cheap Pricey but worth it when it's sale or when you're travelling and need something to listen to when offline. They have audiobooks and podcasts, perfect for auditory people like me . Tried YouTube music Premium and didn't even finish the free trial. I love Spotify too much, Spotify has more audio content. I just wish that the premium version has a dedicated place for all the downloaded stuff and a download button."
"i really like the the design and how easy it is to use. however, i feel like the monthly payment is a bit too much for what it has to serve. i mean, there is no full lyrics even though you paid for the premium one"
Its really good and UI is awesome just needs more customisation options for homepage...like what to show and what not...(eg i don't like recent column) Some customisation options for homescreen layout should be added...besides many albums are also not available...Besides its really a one of best music streaming app. Thankyou.
"I like the fact that you can listen to full albums on this platform, but I wish there was a wider variety of artist from more music genres such as Indie, R&B, and Electronica. I wish the personalized playlist that are suited to my interest were updated more often."
"I've been using this app for a few years, and have always had premium. In the last month or so, when I'm connected to bluetooth stereo at work, it stops playing music, then I have to open up app, and song starts to play again? Why is this happening? Its happening quite frequently?"
"90% Love this App BUT OMG please move the hide song button to the bottom of the list, I have hidden so many songs I actually like and some I can unhide and some I can't even find them to unhide them. Whoever thought that placement was good hadn't had their coffee. Just move it to the bottom of the list please! Also might be an idea to have an area all your hidden songs go to instead of searching several playlists."
"Moved here from Google music. The UX has a few quirks (queue management is harder than it should be), but overall, it does what it needs to."
Favorite music app love it but i would really appreciate having a shuffle button to shuffle all my playlists together I could use that randomness somedays or maybe be able to throw a whole playlist in my cue something like that to mix my many playlists. Lmk thanks!
"Its amazing all the music you csn ask fot you csn turn off your phone listening to it to! The only promblem i have is that like the first day i got it it let me choose the song... Its stuck in shuffle play... I love this app a lot but i dont like it how its stuvk in shuffle play and i have to skip to my song, also when i skip all the way to my song sometimes i run out if skips.. Because i dont have premuim."
It's a good platform for music but if you choose not to or just can't afford the premium the volume of the ads fluctuates from quiet to loud and using it to drown out the machinery while I work the high volume can hurt
"I've been a happy and loyal user for years but the new ui has killed it. at least pick a look. every time I flick from a normal song to a 'popular song' with a video, everything flashes and fades black - slow, not intuitive, and very disruptive. not to mention distracting while driving."
"I love the app, overall very clean and easy to use, but I would love it to have a full lyrics button so that we could choose between seeing only the lyrics or the fun facts"
"It's a great application tho! One thing that bother me is why there's no lyrics option in my Spotify although I'm # premium user and it's already the latest version? Does the lyrics option requires several conditions, i.e android10?"
Love this other than for some reason every time I turn on the play offline button itll load my songs (with the wifi) and then the next time I turn it on it has to re download all over again. That part is dumb. But love this app so much
This app is amazing! I use it so often and me and my friends love making collab playlists. They recommend music depending on what you have listed to recently and it's very accurate. I have found some amazing songs off my recommend. All I would say is premium is quite expensive and I don't really want to spend that much money on it. I would love to be able to listen to the music offline although I will say there is hardly any adverts.
"The app is amazing, I'll give it that. But the problem I had was this: I got off of Spotify for a bit, then when I got back on my playlist wouldn't work, so then I tried another playlist but it wouldn't play either. I pressed the play button multiple times and even closed Spotify out and opened it again. I hope someone knows how to fix this."
"It's time you enable the option to continue playing even after I press on closing all the apps. Besides that, it needs to continue playing after a list of songs ends, or when I search and play one song. Don't stay silent, find something and play! These are the things that I find that are missing. Besides that, I guess it's a good up. Can't say I love the UI, but it's fine"
Really annoying .If you are not a premium customer then you shouldn't download this app the ads would simply ruin your whole mood. And the worst point is that the adds are same every time which makes it even more annoying . If you can purchase the subscription then it is worth it tough.
Love this app. Premium is nice but not required. My only con is that occasionally the app will crash or stop responding to drop down controls while in the background.
"Easy to use, great UI, tons of music to choose from, but can be a little laggy. May just be my phone but I can't confirm or deny that theory."
I love the music quality and the collection... However there are some parts in the app that needs working... Like the payment portals and overall user experience ..
Spotify is quite satisfactory but not extraordinary. I personally want it to be more advanced with varities of more new songs (according to the user's choice )
"Loved it, there could be a little improvement. In android we can't triple click the mic button for previous song, I have to constantly remove my phone from my pocket if I want to play previous song. This is a bad user experience, can you guys please fix this? Thank you."
"When trying to add a song to more then one playlists, it should probably be a lot easier to have to keep going back, clicking on the ""Add to playlist"" button and then having to redo that however many times for each playlist. I love this app, and I've been using it for years, but this is one major flaw that has not had a solution yet."
"A very good music app, both the PC version and Android version. The UI could use some beautification, so to say. Love the music quality."
A really good music app with all genres of music. Shuffle play is also good. The only feature missing is in built lyrics.
"Fantastic music app. But it is absolutely garbage without premium. Like shuffle play. It was annoying enough with the adds, lower music quality and inability to download songs and listen offline, but shuffle play is pushing it too far. Ruins the whole experience."
I had a good start to the app listening to playlist and now it won't play a song right it quickly pause and when you hit play it will do it again. I hope this can be fixed because I really enjoyed the app. It helped me get through a bad night at work.
"I do very much enjoy the free flowing music, informative & insightful pod casts. Oh, and quite easy to navigate even for a luddite like myself."
"It's ok when you can get the right voice to the right song. I mean when I'm listing to rock mostly 80's & 90's stuff the voice does not match with my memorys, an hes sound, range is limited to a voice moddullater program. Digital Dave Duffy and his air guitar band is able to hake Spotify. I have 2 Spotify logos on my phone. Gettagettyagettyagetu."
"Good streaming,not sure if quality is the highest possible (I have it at the highest setting) nevertheless quite pleased. Software has issues, eg after 10 minutes of playing it decides to pause. Also, when I am without wifi it asks me to download again the songs already downloaded before, therefore forcing me to go online and eat up mobile data. Despite it's been around a while now, there seem to be some problems with the stability of the app. Also, some albums are not complete, missing songs..."
Overall the app is quite impressive but would appreciate if you would not put 2 ads in a row cuz i dont like my songs being interrupted but if you cant do that its fine cause i understand that you put up ads to make moneyüòÅ
This is really a super cool and useful app. I really enjoy using it and it keeps you up to date with the latest music and trends. The only downside is that you have to pay R60 per month to get premium which is add free. R60 is quite expensive for me personally but I guess if you have R60 a month to spare it is not that bad.
"Spotify is good and all (except it tragically doesn't play an Indonesian song in Indonesian region), but it's really annoying that the like button is right beside the play/pause button. When you just want to pause a song and ~WHOOPS~ the music got disliked, and out it goes from your playlist of liked songs. please do something with it Spotify..."
"Near perfect. Unfortunately, the file size and bugs ruin it. Apparently, if your SD card is too small, the app repeatedly deletes all your downloaded songs."
"It pretty good, but how do you turn of shuffle these days, and also it won't play the music when I press a song, it just gives me a play button to play and it just goes random and I can't change it. Can you do something about that."
"Good app. Needs to be redesigned for podcast shows, it's hard to find what I've listened to and what I haven't. Castbox has a better design but uses too much battery."
"Excellent. The audio is perfect and I can listen to all my favorite songs, but I can't rewind the songs. I've heard that it's a premium feature and I don't have money to pay for premium so maybe make the rewind button accesible to all."
"Recently this app began to be unable to tell when it's in online mode and I have to go into settings, put it in offline mode, then turn that off for it to acknowledge it's online, which is why I took off a star. Otherwise it's been good, I can access new music, my playlists, it does all the Spotify algo stuff for radio stations or suggested songs. I do wish it allowed for organizing my playlists, but that's about it. I have a Samsung and put it to launch with my Bixby button."
The recommendations for songs and playlists are quite good and the app also runs quite smoothly even though it takes quite a bit of space. 4 stars as there are selectively few songs and if you do not have premium then there will be about 2 to 3 ads after every 7 songs maybe but overall it is the best app for music and podcasts
"HEY, I enjoy using Spotify very much. But the latest update had made the control buttons so small. it's ugly and not easy to use. is this a bug? Please fix it."
"This is the real deal. It's intuitive and versitale. I gave it 4 stars because of the annoying ads. I had the full version for awhile, but couldn't justify the cost... So I deal with the ads now."
"It's nice but kinda weird to manage the random playlists, mainly the songs that already played and you can't see them till you find the right screen, rich is not an intuitive interaction."
"I give Spotify 4 out of 5. Let me explain, I have used 4 - 5 music streaming services; Spotify is the best one among them. Spotify has the best user experience and recommendations. By the way I am an Indian user, I listen to three languages English, Hindi, Malayalam. So, content vise spotify is missing some albums. Hopefully in upcoming days they'll be adding it. I am disappointed with discover weekly which doesn't recommend me malayalam music. So I am giving 4 out of 5."
Well I purchase the Spotify Premium and it'll be playing a song and it'll just stopped so I have to go back in tap on the pause play button sometimes that doesn't even work and I want to know why it's doing that because I paid for the premium so it just randomly stops playing during songs and podcast
"Yo Spotify! I have a few issues about this app. On older versions, the app isn't very optimised, so it can be quite slow. Secondly, the reason I prefer using an APP like TIDAL over Spotify is because it allows users to swipe up from the bottom tab that says the currently playing song. I've seen this implemented in many apps and Spotify would be great. the now playing needs a refresh - it looks dull! Finally, could you consider the desktop version and let us stream any song with ads? > Shuffle"
"Spotify is pretty good and it's worth ¬£10/month for me to use the premium version, as I do hammer it. But it is quite short for more underground music, particularly electronic and dance from the 80s & 90s. This is despite many more mainstream artists having many versions of the same album available. That eats a lot into the promised 30 million tracks. Hence I can only give it four stars until they load up."
"Downloaded this to my tab like spotify normally it's on my phone. But it has been a nuisance to login, use or open on my tab. It refuses to cooperate on any level past the login page no matter what email's given."
"This is great app for music, but recently the ads pop up way more often, before the recent updates I would be able to listen to 6-8 songs without getting an ad but now it's like 4-5 also ruining the ""30 min ad free listening"""
"The application is working fine. I noticed after some intense search and play a crash of the application. It's possible to send you somehow the logs (if you store those)? Also after the same search and play use case, the UI doesn't respond as expected. Seems like the request to the backend is made only after some time and in this case the song is played with delay."
"I have given fair and equal consideration to Apple Music, Pandora Premium, Youtube Music, and Spotify. Regardless of my criteria, Spotify ranks superior. Most significant to me--due to our current musical landscape--is discovery of new music. Spotify creates personalized Daily Mixes for its users, each one synthesized harmoniously from tracks in my library and tracks unknown to me. Just make lyrics available consistently, and add a 'play next' button (or tell me where it is). I üíã Spotify!"
Switched from YouTube music to Spotify and I am happy. Playlist function is awesome. Filled my library with awesome albums. One thing is disappointing me - library space is limited. Couldn't add more that 10 or 12 thousands songs. But it can be handled by listening daily mixes. Fresh and juicy music every day.
Awesome music app with a GIGANTIC selection of genres. Only downside is excessive ads but for free can I really complain. Just hit that watch button as much as possible for 30 minutes free if ads.
"Great music and past streaming app. Love the ui. but since last update when i ask Google assistant to play a particular song on Spotify, it is now playing wrong song every time, which was not the case before update!"
"I love Spotify, but why when I ""click to watch a short video and receive 30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" do I immediately get 5 back to back ads after the video is over? This happens quite often"
"I love the list of songs Spotify puts together for me. I also like the ease of building my own song lists, and using my favorite songs as a song list. Great app!"
"I truly believe the only thing stopping this from being the best music player software of all time (windows media player, napster, QuickTime, winamp, iTunes, etc) is a higher end in app equalizer. More bands than my phone or truck. For the best playback possible!"
"I love it! It's good to have all your fav songs on one platform that doesn't take up that much space rather than downloading tons of songs that take up much more space, i only have one problem with it which is that not everyone has the money and the ad's ruin the vibe."
"Spotify's a great app for listening to music whenever and wherever. The only problem I have is that once they've made a proper UI change that improves the quality and ease of use for the app after a while, they later on remove those improvements and make it worse and much more complex as well as time consuming to navigate the application. You get used to the changes sooner or later but it still subtly annoys you every now and again."
"I love this app but hey nowadays when I go offline, the songs I've downloaded suddenly stops playing and I don't know why, like after 2-3 songs and then it'll stop mid-way again. I have to manually play it and then it stops again. Idk if it's a bug but it's been going on for me quite lately. Pls fix this."
"Adding the ""Hide this song"" button to the top was the worse idea they could've have and it makes adding to playlists frustrating, especially if you're grabbing songs from bigger playlists."
"Just amazing app I listen to on Spotify but I want it to allow download feature as I don't want to pay subscription and the ads are quite annoying at times, otherwise it's all good"
"being a student with chaotic moods, this is a good companion. ive started using premium because ive been guilty of pirating vids into mp3s. besides, it's good to just search for the songs straight from their albums. i also get to find playlists other listeners have to try. although, sometimes i wish there's multiple select when i'm adding/removing them on a playlist."
"Love it but the UI is a bit clunky and podcasts lack functionality, neither of which prevent me for using it as my go to app for music and pods."
"Naw, Spotify, put the repeat button back where it was, please - easily accessible from the main ""now playing"" playlist menu, the minimized playlist menu AND from the lock screen."
"It's terrific except once your past the 7 day initial use period they start to censor your access to build out your ""likes"" and the app will not wait for you to touch an accept to get the 30 minute bonus periods. Otherwise I'm thoroughly enjoying this well conceived app, although it does tax your process speed."
A perfect music app. Very convenient to use and especially its interface. Just happy with it. It requires some tweaks but other than that everything is completely fine.
"The Best ! The design and song recommendation is excellent. Please add : Number of songs in a playlist, same like desktop app. Also need an option add multiple songs to a playlist."
"would give it 5 stars if it had its own custom full screen music player when the phone is locked, take for example the Naver music app. I don't like this tiny strip, I'd much rather have bigger buttons and I want to see the album art clearly, not just a tiny square... Biggest pet peeve that I have with this streaming service."
I love this app so much. However I accidentally hid some song that I love when I didnt know what that button ment. I cant find a way to unhide them and it's kinda annoying. If you could fix that please that would be great.
"This app is good if you have premium, of course. All my favorite artists are there and all the songs I like. But there's one thing I absolutely hate: the hide this song button. So many times I wanted to add a song to a playlist but accidentally hid it because this hide song button is at the top. Why at the top? And yes, I wrote this review after I accidentally hid a song again. It feels like biting into something that's supposed to be soft and suddenly you hear a crunch."
"I love it. Easily worth premium imo! My only nit-pick with it is that the hide button is right above the add to playlist option, which is a bit annoying since I accidentally click the hide option since they're so close to each other. Besides that, I love it"
"The sound quality could be way better. I don't care for some reason that some songs are quite then other songs, ( why is that ? ) On the other hand I like the very wide selection of this app."
"I really loved the button next to the setting option on the home page to go through the latest releases, by the followed artists. Please bring that back."
"The UI is a bit wonky when you want to mass edit your collections, but other then that when used as premium it's spot on. Useless when free."
"Great from the very beginning. And you can tell this app is the best when the competition compliments your work but then has a little problem with it but it compares it to their own app that way if people read the review they will check that app and download it, being a crappy app and from India, but from experience don't do it, simply, their app suxz soooooooo much you be wasting your time. Keep up the awesome Work SPOTIFY team you have gone and left your mark on this world and we love u 4 it."
"Best music app. Just some features that could be added. The one that I would like to see most is an ""add to queue"" feature for playlists. Currently, if I want to add a playlist to my queue, I have to add each song individually and it is quite a time-consuming method. Otherwise, the app is amazing."
"Top app 4 tunes. Not too many adds, just annoying enough to force you into a premium account. Nothing like some INSURANCE sales to ruin your jams on a chillout session. yeah learn when I'm crashing, then bamm.. that add you love so much.. cranking at least a %20 volume increase (Legal in aus? Not sure. TV & radio only get %10, I think) I never checked? Worth upgrade not have to hover over volume constantly. Grumpy neibours don't like the free version..üòâ"
"Great music collection. One of the best user experience. Also, one recommendation, improve algorithm behind auto playlist collection."
"Love the ability to save playlists of songs I like. But with the free service the commercials have gotten stupid. They make you push a button for 30 uninterrupted minutes. No big deal. Except that if say, you're driving, or working , and can't reach your phone they take advantage of that by making you listen to 2 or 3 minutes of commercials. This is especially lame when it's the same commercial (usually for Spotify no less) 4 or 5 or 6 times in a row. Give me a break! Otherwise it's great."
"The Library feature needs to be more comprehensive. This app is so much better than Apple Music, but when it comes to library management, Apple Music wins because you can add individual songs in the library, but if you want to discover new music, I think Spotify is better with its algorithms at work, and the app is also very well built and is uniform across platforms."
"I've collection of 50K songs in my hard drive but Spotify takes you to another level. You can get customized playlist, very high quality Music and podcast! It has in-built feature that normalizes audio according to your choice. But there are many bands from 80's and 90's are missing. I hope they add them soon!"
(Resolved) I remember using spotify before and it would never play songs that weren't in the playlist. I find this quite annoying because I have a preferred taste in music. (Resolved)
"Overall you guys are tops at what you do but there could be some improvements in your selections ie, more deluxe albums and remixes free offline even if its a limited ammount. Say twenty. Bren having difficult downloading songs and even accessing artist info to add new songs to my playlist."
This app is quite reliable. It's all good and feel good app. Plus there are different playlists which you can choose according to your mood. I recommend.
"it's easy to use, you can even let it go to your homescreen for quick accessibility. Although, if you go through the shuffle, sometimes it will or won't add random music that isn't on your Playlist and it makes it inconsistent."
The expectation with this app is more than I thought it had. And the premium packages are also economical and are prepared as per requirements which is a very good development. But the only thing I feel missing is old categories of songs either it may be albums or movie oriented. Otherwise its all good!!!!üëç
"The app is great, but i give 4 because i find something odd. The song plays as if someone is throwing a ball suddenly on u. It should have a little build up. Plzz consider it if u would likeüòÅ"
The stream quality was quite good but I wish the downloaded quality could be better. More bass and clearer in high notes. It would be much better if users could make adjustments to dB. Like an audio tuner or something like that.
"Most suitable app. I love listening and singing the songs. But sometimes I don't get that song that I want to listen to. But very cool. But one problem that it does not play songs offline üòí For playing offline you have to pay. I hate this rule all else everything is fine and YES!! This app makes my mood calm, emotional and romantic üòçüòç üëèüëèüëè"
"I wish there was more functionality, like being able to set custom order of music within Playlist. Another thing is stuff like Google Assistant controls, you should be able to add songs to Playlists, not just like them. Furthermore, the menus and ui is a bit clunky and simple things like searching within Playlists is cumbersome."
"Anything you can do on web or desktop, this app offers too. Doesn't crash, looks good. On the other hand, still a Spotify product thus a total nightmare to navigate around, a huge operate-and-drive hazard, a disastrous song queing logic, etc. Basically a user experience fiasco. However wouldn't be fair to drop more than one star as it delivers in all other aspects."
I just fall in love with Spotify music! And Spotify is one of the best music platform i found! Gradient UI is one of its best practices to distinguish the UX from other ones
Best you can ask for nowadays. Spotify eliminated the need for keeping music files anywhere. I do have an issue and that's not being able to turn off or remove any recommendations of the country you're in compared to the one you want. Arranging the playlists is also kinda of a pain. Doesn't feel very intuitive.
"The UI could be better. I think there should be a search bar at all times in the Liked Songs playlist. Plus, when you look at an artist's page, you should be able to swipe to the left or right to go to the songs that are in your library. The app experience is pretty good, but I think more could be experimented and improved."
"Intuitive, easy playlist management and good download quality in general. Lack of configuration options tho."
"This app is great, and is definitely worth paying $10 a month for premium. My main gripes with the app are that it frequently updates the mobile ui which can sometimes make it difficult to find what you want, and it doesnt have an alphabetical scroll bar in your library like it used to, which makes it inconvenient and annoying. That being said, these are only minor inconveniences, other than that the app is great."
"The music selection is quite extensive and the sound quality is also, quite good. Trying to work your way round the system can be difficult, for example, setting up playlists using spotify albums, doesn't seem to work. Try adding podcasts, you get the recommended, but how to add your choice, so that they will then be available on the car system."
Few good and famous songs are not available. The app is amazingly good and the UI is easy to browse songs. It is a good app for playing music.
"been using for a very long time. also on premium ever since but the last update literally ruined my mood. my downloaded albums, playlist won't stop loading until i connect back to the internet. it felt like i need to go online just for the list of downloaded songs to show up."
"Good music app. Nice UI, but the thing is, the ads are far too long, like 30 seconds or so and having to go through a long ad just when you're favorite song is about to come up, makes you want to close the app and listen to the song in some other app. If it doesn't bother you like me, you'll really love it!"
"This is genuinely a good app. There's some songs I really wanna listen to like ""Wishing Well"" by Juice WRLD but it's not in there. I also suggest there's a exploit filter. It's gonna be a whole lot better with that."
So you should improve the hidden song function so I was listening to the liked song and my play list ended and random songs started to play I like one of the songs but I mistakely press hidden songs button and automaticly it switched to other song I never saw the name of the song properly and never see it again so pls can you make a folder of the hidden song so we can know where to go is we click the hidden song button by a mistake
"I like the app. Not much to complain about, but I accidentally hide one of my favorite songs. I looked up how to unhide, but when I went to do it, the unhide button wasn't there. I just hope it would get fixed."
Awesome. The fact that it can run while I do other things on line at the same time is great. This way my life is in happy mode whole working on line. I am a new customer and I suffer from life's experiences but need music to save me from deep migranes from thinking too hard. I have lived my life listening to music and doing chores all day uplifts me and lightens my load off my shoulders. A tremendous therapy for me to be able to saved upbeat songs to quicken my pace at work is awesome. Thank you
A little tricky trying to navigate through the menus. Not super intuitive but once you figure it out it's good.
"I'm paying the premium subscription to listen in high quality and without any ads. Now, every now and then an ad pops up for me to acquire a duo plan. I really don't like that."
Has most of what you want to listen to. Can be a bit slow if using it through voice control. Easy to use app though that is quick and informative.
This app is really good but it doesn't have all playlist of many other famous artist that's quite disappointing about this app.....I would like to tell you to reduce some ads it has way to much ads in every half an hour....this app is really good you guys can use it
"I use spotify a couple hours everyday. At this point its my sauce of entertainment, all sorts of playlists I dive into depending on the scene, and as I write this, I'm gonna play a sleep playlist to help me nap. I listen to podcasts on there as well. The Linux desktop App could use some work. Takes a good minute or 2 to load up and start functioning"
Four stars are only because it doesn't support going to the previous track by pressing the headphone button thrice. Please add this support. I really need it!
The app is good it serves its function for which it is built like listening to the music online.It takes its time to understand your liking but once it is there it's playlist are very accurate...n you'll love it within a few days
"Latest updates have bugs where music pauses randomly and the play/pause button on the android lock screen doesnt work intermittently. Confirmed it is not the data or battery settings. Other reviews here say the same. It wont stop me using spotify since i only listen here and on Triple J, but dammn its annoying!"
It gives good recommendation and I suggest it over other apps. It works on multiplatform But the problem is it gives a lot of ads which ruins the mood that's why I deduct one star
"I love this app but I want to know if it will change the search button on top instead of settings like Spotify web, this is much easier to search song into the playlist."
"Overall Spotify has been a really good app for when I want to listen to music. I would give it five stars but there is something that annoyes me quite alot while using the app. I don't have Spotify premium and whenever I try listen to my playlists I make, it plays one song the goes onto recommend ones and never play another song on my playlist! It's really annoying but apart from that the app is great and my go to music app! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Initially I had issues but after several reboots it works. My favourite feature: block crappy artists. Catalogue can be improved, even though it is already quite big."
"Playlists need folder ability. sorting UI needs work. There needs to be the option to store playlists in folders for quicker access and sorting. It gets a bit out of hand when you have 50+ playlists on the go and there is aassive need to easily comprehend your own sorting attempts. Please make sorting and adding songs to playlists better. I hate having to retap add to playlist 13 times to add the song I'm listening to, to 2 or more playlists. It's so agonizing. I can't be the only one üòì"
"Difficult to get Spotify to plan on ChromeCast even when done before; button just doesn't show up. A lot of the music I looked for ain't on here (metal, punk, heavy stuff.) Other than that, pretty good."
"I had issues this past week with the app droppin/cutting out so I logged out, had issues logging back in and also with password reset. So, I un/reinstalled app. My email to support was responded to very quickly, they sent the correct link for reset and got me back to my podcast. Thanks Spotify team! Hopefully the app shutting down will come to an end now..."
"Great app, so easy to use and the playlists are awesome! Sometimes it even seems like the app gets my mood when listening to my liked songs on shuffle lol The only issue is when listening to my discover weekly playlist the like/dismiss buttons won't work if im not in the app itself (like on my lock screen, or in my pull down view), it happens also on my iPad (atm I'm using an Android device)."
"Crashes when I try to listen to podcast The app is great but after i upgraded to premium The podcast that I listen to at work won't load. Its specifically Last podcast network podcast who are fulltime spotify exclusive now. Shows like ""wizard and the bruiser"" & ""Abe Lincons top hat"" both crash the app whenever I load the playlist."
"To me it is the best app for listening to music. However there is a small bug when connected with a PS4. When you press the button that plays the music in random mode(the two crossed arrows), it shows a completely different song in both the phone screen and the PS4 monitor, that prevents the feature from working properly."
"It does what it says on the proverbial tin but there are a few songs that, for whatever reason, do not exist and it closes down quite often. I'm giving a four star purely for the fact it closes down more often than I would like."
Cool and fun to explore new music in this app. You can listen to songs depending on your mood and more. Can listen to podcasts too. But sometimes just stops and disappears and I have to open the app and click play button again which is annoying... Yeah but it's cool other than that.
"We subscribe, and it's a nice system for listening to the stuff I like. Docked one star because of ""rating system"". There should be more than a like and a never button. I want the program to know what I ""like"" without it being placed in my favorites"
"(Premium user) Exceptional app for listening to music, the quality is remarkable, and the variety is surprisingly big. However, there are some playing issues with the shuffle button, the driving mode results somewhat troublesome in order to find a particular song, and sometimes the tracks stop randomly at certain points."
"It was fine earlier, but recently when I'm doing stuff on my phone and spotify is running in the background it sometimes stops and it shows that it's playing, but it isn't. So, you have to press the play button, which will reset the song and when you go into the app itself, it shows it is at zero and you have to listen to the song again if you don't have premium or any skips left. So, I hope this will be fixed."
"Its a good music searching app. But there aint some songs available on spotify that I find on some other app. And can we have an option or a button sort of to disable vulgar words because some songs may have vulgar words no doubt but some people wont like hearing the lyrics but they like the music produced. If spotify can fix this, then I'll rate it 5 stars"
Have been using Spotify for quite awhile now just one problem with it in the recent update now it pauses the song randomly when you finish a playlist instead of repeating the playlist or playing other songs related to your liked but that's it
"My phone is samsung s7 edge, i know its quite old but i still get dissapoined when sometimes i dont see ""instagram stories"" choice to share my song even when my ig and spotify has been updated, i need to re-open the app times to get the option show up"
"It was really good till this latest update. Everytime I press shuffle, it plays the first song on my list, and the button than says ""pause"" instead of shuffle. Why aren't the songs shuffling?"
"I love this app. It has everything i want here. The music plays very smoothly and there are no ads or anything that is annoying. Despite everything, there is something i dont like: the premium. I understand that yall want money and stuff but like some of us cant afford it. That is quite annoying cuz they r very biars to their premium users. If u dun hv premium, you can only skip a few songs and you cannot choose the song you want to play. Plus, the premium is very expensive."
"Nice use of available devices, tv, etc Makes the experience easily portable. Nice to be able to play full albums, a must for old geezers like me. On that subject, some albums and songs are missing, like DEVO's ""Oh no, it's ..."" and songs like Knock Boots by the same group. Fix that and I'll give it 5 stars score. Also, as opposed to the desktop app, the mobile version UX leaves a lot to be desired (hearted an unheated icons are the same, c'mon) plus it forces you to listen to albums in shuffle?"
"The Overall UI experience is great, specially when all the UI is in dark theme. It is very useful as I listen to music at night. The only problem is that there is only a limited amount of music present based on regions."
"Spotify is great. The app is great. My only issue is that it often downloads the same songs I've already downloaded and it's quite frustrating. You would assume once it's downloaded, its there for good, but that's not the case. Please look into that. Otherwise, great app."
"Good app but still a few recurring bugs: - When switching wifi > 4g, there's a quite long period when the app is ""offline"" (other app such as browser can access network properly) - Since latest update the widget isn't loading (android 10, Nova launcher)"
App UI is good. Sound quality is good. I have reduced 1 star star for increased ads and some missing songs. Please update the songs.
Cuts out sometimes to connect to my airpods when connected to my Jeep. But a quick disconnect and reconnect gets it working again. Only complaint that I have otherwise it would be 5 stars.
"Good UI and individual song control. Can use a channel page for playlist creators. Btw I don't hate ads, but three in a streak are annoying."
"Good music app. Wish it had a ""dislike"" button to get rid of songs from reappearing on your suggestions. Otherwise, use it everyday and love it"
Overall a great app but this most recent update seems to have made it so if I open up anything that plays a video or sound instead of pausing my music it quits out of the app entirely.
"It's great but could be better. It's the best music streaming available though, I've tried quite a few different ones but always come back to Spotify! I've had the premium for about a year now but lately it's started doing this weird thing where I'm out somewhere and my playlist that had been downloaded doesn't play and suddenly says it's downloading again. It never used to do that. Also I so hope we could get the Spotify kids in the UK, it launched in Ireland already do when do we get it??"
This is a great app i use it all the time. But i am done with the same spotify premuiem ads. I dont have the money to do that every month but i really just want to listen to my music without 5 spotify premuiem ads after every 3 songs.
"Essential app, but still unstable. Works fantastically right up until it crashes. Quick load time, though. Probably your best bet right now."
"Love it alot BUT really wish I could have the old format back... today ruined the way I made playlist and dated them/ named them based on what I was doing, sorta like a music journal..I can't even see how many songs are in the playlist I made easily, butter either way... loveeee it"
The ux for adding currently playing track to a playlist is very bad. Its hard to touch 3dots button then add to playlist especially in large screen phones.
"Quite good, no complaints albeit not having a certain sticky fingers song on there, but y'all need a feature inwhich geolocates artists nearby so you can follow and find all the local and up and coming artists! Also, if you could sort playlists by genre that would be absolutely unreal!"
"It is a good app I almost got every songs I searched for, but the advertisement comes quite often which I didn't really found good in this . Others may not have problems with this advertise but when we are not in a good mood and just want to listen songs without any disturbance, the advertise sounds really annoying though I don't have premium account."
This is the best app to listen to music. Sometimes i would listening to my music and then an ad interupts it. Thats the only i hate and i dont have the mony to get spotify premuim.
"One of the best music app source out their. And yes there are advertisements to as well often.but it doesn't show the whole album of songs on it like you want it too, to know that its suppose to be playing all the required songs on the album."
"It works fine on my Android in general but somehow I was not able to use the Chromecast feature. Whenever I choose the ""Devices Available"" button, it only directs me to a page where I can see a selection of devices that I can connect to. When I chose ""Chromecast"", all it does is pop up an instructions window. I have made sure that both are connected to the same network."
"I'm very thankful for having free premium for thru sbux. The discover weekly is very awesome. I just really, really wish you can look up your history. Bc I'm left with feeling stupid for not liking or screenshot a very good week's playlist. Like seriously make this happen. Plzz"
It's a great app and provides most of the songs...few songs are not there but during the play if the music there is no later and required very own data...
Some songs are not explicit but appears as explicit. Quite sad that not many songs from a particular singer is available either due to the songs being explicit reported by users.
Been a pro sub for many years now quite easy to navigate and is good if you have a family account wide variety of songs and quite easy to set up playlist only draw back is that if you want to delete playlists you won't know what songs your deleted unless you like every single one.
"I love the app. Organizing my music is nice, however the last couple days my music has been cutting out when my screen is locked. I'm not sure if there was an update or if anyone else is experiencing the same issue but its quite irritating."
Everything's all right but I guess you could improve those visuals and layout designs? Otherwise I love this app as it gives me the daily dose of free good quality music streaming!
"It's good and all, but it sometime loads forever, I don't know why. And sometimes music stops playing, but it shows as it is still playing, it's very weird. Last thing especially happens when songs are being downloaded. P.S. I'm living in Russia btw. And Spotify on Linux (or Windows) works way smoother and snappier."
"Love the app, I use it all the time. However i dislike that I have to go through a menu to find the ""search playlist"" function. Please put the search bar back on top of the playlist (right below shuffle button). This is the only reason I'm giving the app four stars instead of five."
"I'm not sure which genius thought it was a good idea to remove the search function from Liked Songs and put it into the main playlist folder, but it no longer let's me search for any songs, meaning I have to trawl through all my songs if I'm offline. Please fix this, its been an issue for at least 6 months now and is a UX nightmare."
"Great quality music, big selection. Should have been a 5 star review, but the music gets louder when I open an application and quieter when it's just playing music."
"Been a Spotify customer for quite sometime now and it's a great platform for music lovers... However it's not perfect. I feel that the EQ function should be available across all platforms (PC, android, ios etc etc). Daily playlists, even though fairly accurate can be quite predictable and very samey. Other than the things stated I enjoy using the app! Thanks Spotify."
"Nice experience. But the color of the control button on the notification bar changes with the background image. It's interesting, but sometimes its merely visible. So its better to give a user friendly color, white would be appropriate..."
"I love the app, easy to use to a point the odd updates cause slight confusion... Use to be able to ""remove song"" now everything's based on the üíì Like button... So I'm unsure if it deletes off my account or not, and the current issue is when downloading, the song count will freeze at a number and the songs will stop downloading now ""waiting to download"" resulting in re-installing app to fix. Still love and use it, this new issue is just tad annoying. So many bands I'm trying to add but cant."
"app is amazing but there a few things i wish were added to the android version. it would be cool if we were given a button option that says ""remove from playlist"" on each song instead of having to look up the song, bring up the option menu and remove it. also, it would be cool if we had the option to edit the playlists description on android. the app is good like i said but it could be so much more customizable therefore more fun to use!"
Only reason I didn't award a 5 star rating is because lots of playlists have missing songs. I do use the app quite often and find it very convenient for varied listening. Not bad at all!
So good so far but if you add this feature the app will become 7 stars app: in the notification bar you have the song slider to return it back and also a button to return 5 seconds and you can cutomize those features in the app
"Steps away from perfect. Spotify has the best interface among all of its competitors and its an amazing service. But, the only thing that I don't like about Spotify is that they differentiate between Android and Ios in terms of UI and overall stability. I have an iPad and spotify has a much better experience on it than on my Android device. Also, there should be an option to remove downloaded songs from a particular Playlist."
Only problem with Spotify is the fact that there are many other music apps that dont require you to pay for a membership in order to download songs for offline use and have no ads.
"Pretty good - works fine, has everything I want, easy to use. Only criticisms are the search mechanism is a bit shonky and it's easy to hit the wrong button by mistake and stop the track you're listening to. But maybe that's my sausage fingers. I'd give it 5 stars if it was free, but it's not."
"Ok I have been using the app for quite a while and have had a pretty good experience with Spotify. However, I just wish it would work in all network connectivity conditions. Please work on this. üôÇ"
"Great Music selection 5 out of 5. HOWEVER the user interface needs work. Shuffle features are mediocre at best. From Spotifys own community forum, they don't seem to reach out or have real solutions to customers complaints or concerns about the user experience. That's really ashame considering that this is a paid service. That is why I had to deduct a star *"
It is one of the best music streaming apps (if not the best right now). Though four stars are just because it's been a while and you guys have still not added a lot of tracks from some renowned artists which should have been added quite a long time back .And it still says 'we are trying hard to bring music to your region ' and it's quite disheartening to see that message still.
"I am grateful that for a small monthly fee but no fixed contract you can get a whole genre of music suited to the individuals need. I was surprised at the range of music as I am a music lover, and believe in a Good Range of music aswel as of Good Quality is needed for a Positive Mind. In the past I have had Vinyl, Cassette, CD, Minidisc, RW/R, But who can carry their whole music media collection with them? Welldone Spotify! It would be great to allow users to change the colours of the display."
"It's great. Has a great UI which makes it easy for me to find my playlists, favorite songs, etc. but I do have one problem: Whenever I use spotify, it's always guaranteed to crash at some point while I'm listening to music. It's annoying at times."
"It's a great app, easy to use with lots of great functionality and love the personal mixes. App stops mid song quite frequently- very annoying otherwise I'd give it a fiver!"
"All I can say is, it is a great app. Although it has a lot of room to grow and adapt more settings and options related to music technology. Also something should be done about payments. For example my bank card require 3D security and I had to use another card to pay for my subscription."
"Spotify is a great app for music, however it does required certain fee each month if u want premium features. I think this is fine but not for me personally. One thing I dislike about is ads, but in the end of the day, I enjoy Spotify and had got used to the ads."
"Great web interface with a neat design that's easily navigable. Music selection can be a tad more limited than on other platforms, but there's still a decent variety of music from different artistes for the choosing. Not a bad app wholly. Worth the download."
"There are more or less all artists on Spotify, yet there are some international artists like Alec Benjamin, Coldplay, etc. that I am not able to find. I hope you're able to widen the song collection in Spotify India. All in all, I absolutely love the UI and the experience. This app made me fall in love with music, again."
"I dont the layout and the lack of control of your liked songs. When I started I had trouble differentiating between downloaded, liked, and following. Gets too complicated. WITH THAT BEING SAID, I love Spotify premium and the value is amazing. I'm yet to not find a song on here even from my childhood. Podcast are a cool addition, I would like to see better videos or graphics pkaying while a song plays. Flipping between the same 5 photos is kinda lame. Equalizer ü§ô cool beans. 3.5 stars totalforme"
I just recently gotten spotify premium and since then the app has been glitching quite badly. I've made plently of room on my divice and SD card to download music and it's just not doing it. Please fix this or at least tell me of a way to it. I love the app and I NEED my music.
"While the app is great and the music acceptable, there is NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT!! The website runs you round and round to avoid giving you support and then unloads you into the ""community"" pages. I'm having security issues in my account but I can't reach anyone at Spotify! Epic fail. UPDATE: Much higher rating. Once I *did* actually manage to reach customer support (by accident almost), they were extremely helpful and responsive. Got the issue resolved extremely quickly. Thank you Jenniebee"
Sometimes it doesn't load as quick as it should and it messes up with the experience. The service is great but the app has its problems.
"RE: Ongoing opportunities for the beautification of Spotafizle Dear Spotify team, Please fix the bug where the pause button doesn't work on the lockscreen (Samsung Galaxy A5) it pauses for a millisecond and then resumes playing. Please make it possible to back-track a song on a playlist from the first song in my playlist. (i.e.: If: I back-track on the first song on my playlist, Then: play the last song in my playlist. <3"
"Can anyone help me get Spotify to recognize my SD card? Followed a lot of guides on the internet but to no avail. Tried moving the cache folder, reinstalling the app, etc. but the option to choose where to download songs under the storage tab still doesnt pop up for me"
"Good overall experience. Sometimes it has connectivity issues with Google homes and streaming over multiple Google home speakers. Also downloaded songs still require data unless you turn on offline mode, should be a no-brainer, but it still does it."
Wish you didn't have it automatically shuffling the songs when we play it and quit playing songs that aren't part of the album. I actually like to listen to the songs in order.
"Obviously the best music app, but sometimes it tells me I'm offline when I'm not, and sometimes I have problems linking my desktop spotify to my phone's Spotify. Could definitely be more intuitive"
"I appreciate the amount of ways you can sort and edit playlists and the amount of songs. However, I think the UI on Xbox can be greatly improved"
"Love it so far , wish there was a button or something when it asks you watch this video to get 30 mins of free non ad that you check it and it auto plays the ad video so you don't have to click it."
"Plus: Good quality audio, Minimalist dark design, Easy to access for premium user, Can add local music. For the Minus: Accessibility for free user are bad, Free user always anoyed by advertisement, Can't add local music on the phone, There is no selection for theme because i think not everyone like dark theme, High price for people that want to get premium."
Spotify as a streaming music app simply works. The latest changes to viewing your playlists makes it really difficult to listen to songs and only displays a preview soundbite on mobile. I enjoyed the UI when you could sort and filter but the FAQs haven't been updated since September to reflect these changes.
"Spotify has a large variety of songs. Is there a way to add songs from outside the site? Without having to upload them? The only other feature that needs improvement on the phone and pc, is the ""add to playlist"" function? Perhaps make it an easy button to press like the ""likes song"" and ""shuffle? I recommend the student discount."
Looks like I am experiencing the same as others. I thought it was me hitting buttons by mistake. But yes it keeps stopping when it wants. Only happens when I'm on the road. And the one person who is going to say that's why. I live in a huge city. To find a dead spot is almost impossible these days.
"It's great, I have a premium account, but lately every time I try to press the options to a song or album or anything, the app freezes and I have to reboot my phone. Can't go to an artist from a song, or share a playlist, or anything that involves any option button."
"The app is great, way cheaper if you get your family to join you on the family plan. They build customized playlists at the end of each year which are usually really good."
Provides a great user experience and a vast genre of music (special mention for EDM's). It would be great if we can tap & hold to move a song up/down in our playlists permanently.
"Overall the best app for music, however not being able to see the number of songs on a playlist is quite irritating. Will this be brought back ever?"
Think price is a little bit high So I settle with free with ads but sometimes there to repetitive but for a tenner is rather have adds 5 99 would be a more suitable price since we could all be downloading our music free but choose to use this app
"I have experienced unexpected stops when I'm listening to music and when I listen to music and pause it and leave it there the thing on the notification box that helps you have excess to skipping and pausing quickly,shuts off and I have to go back to the app to listen to my music.Please improve your app."
"Intuitive to use. Great selection. Just wish thete were an option when listening to a playlist, to delete a song from your list and library."
"Sometimes the application gets confused about whether I'm connected to the internet and I have to force close it and open it again, but aside from that I've had a very pleasant user experience."
"Song database's quite complete, most of my musics are there. Playlist recommendation also very helpful. Just lack of lyrics. should has lyrics so we can sing a song if we don't remember the lyrics"
Would be better if you didnt add songs to our playlist so i can listen to what i want to listen instead of music you added based on algirythms to better suite our taste and add a user friendly service
Ux could be better. Would be great to have more flow. So many clicks and screen changes for what feel like intuitive paths.
"App does tend to lag a bit. Major annoyances include it not recognizing when wifi is available even when it is not set to offline mode, the app displays no connection. Time delay when play button is pressed. I have an s10+ so I am doubtful that it has anything to do with my O.S"
This app is pretty good but in order for you to download music you have to be a Premium Member which requires you to pay a certain amount of money. Offline mode also is useless cause your downloaded music is sometimes undownloaded . Otherwise it is an amazing app .üåùüåùüëçüëç
"Very nice selection of songs. Wish it would recommend songs more based on your ""liked"" playlist or ither playlists. It tends to only go by genres though. I ""liked"" a bunch of Indie songs, so all the recommend songs are about Indie music. Needs to be more like the style of song. Dance, rock, folk, etc. It just recommends random Indie songs not in the style I like. I loved Pandora because the did this and got it right. Then they changed everything and ruined it all. I still like spotify better tho"
"The only thing I hate is that the app doesn't have a play next button. Guess you do it on purpose, but it's bad. I shouldn't have to scroll from a queue of 100 songs for my desired next song. Please fix that."
I like it but I hate when I make a Playlist and they Add 1one I'm like Seriously! Barely This app knows My favourite Music Please make an option when we make a playlist that says : Do you want us to add some for you . And there's a button that says : Hmm Not sure or Sure! . because it's Making me Mad!
"Solid service, lack functionality So i have spotify premium, its a nice service and helps the singers, BUT, it lack a function that even the most basic music player have and should be mandatory, you CANNOT tripple tap ur headphone button to go to previous track, u can skip one by double tap, but not the previous? Fix this men, it infuriates me everytime, i have to take my phone out every 5 mins. For an app ta offers paid service and basic service for freemium users, come on."
"It's good at intuiting your musical taste, but it's not human. Sometimes it gets boring and you just have to manually mix it up."
The big UI update a few months ago was an annoyance. My entire artist library disappeared and so I had to 'follow' every artist individually to restore it. Hate how liking an album forces you to save every single track to your library so you have to unlike the album itself and instead 'like' individual tracks to discard of the filler/remix tracks Bit clunky and needs a rework. Minus 1* for both causing this annoyance with the UI update abd because it took me 3 months to figure out the above
"One of the best music streaming platform. Fast response from their Customer Service. The only thing is, I hope that Spotify has an UNLIKE button for the LIKED songs. So we could edit the playlist. Also i need to move on and i want to forget all the songs that reminds me of him. Please.. üòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠"
"I use spotify a lot and i do alleviate having any song i can imagine right at my finger tips any time i wish. Though i realize that it is necessary for the company to make some money, i wish it was more affordable to get a premium account. that, add maybe not have quite so many ads so often"
4 stars since it is not quite as intuitive as I like. Plus the volume controls disappear from my lock screen (galaxy 9) when I pause the music.
"Very convenient way to explore new music. Compatible with a large range of equipment, including my Novafidelity X40, unlike Amazon music. It is a little more expensive than Amazon, which is why I only gave 4 stars"
"Wonderful app but the design updates are making it less and less useable. With the latest update I can't even pause or skip songs in the apl, I can only do it through my phones notification board. I use it a lot but they're slowly pushing me away."
"Been using this for a couple of years now,and I find it decently reliable. Not many issues besides some functions but those are build in and can see how'd they help others."
"This is the best streaming music player, I've ever used.The interface is very intuitive and the design of the app is outstanding. This makes Spotify stand out from the crowd. Other apps don't look that nice compared to this guy.Then, we get almost 50m+ songs. But, however this app doesn't have some of the songs from artist like Coldplay, Linkin Park etc. Prosüëç Awesome design and interface Daily mix Wide variety of playlists Consüëé No wide variety of songs No wide variety of artists Costly"
The only thing I don't like is how the set up is for podcasts as I am used to Apple and recently switched to android and I am now using Spotify for podcasts but not finding it quite as user friendly.
A wonderful service and app that after a year I'd find it hard to live without but full of annoying quirks. Like the inability to add playlists to the queue and wonderful but weirdly limited clock integration which makes it easy to select a playlist but not a single song.
"Great app overall however, since the latest update it has become quite unstable with multiple crashes and frequent lockups. I hope this will be resolved soon."
Brilliant app and really loved it's UI but this app automatically download songs again and again. Really frustrating sometimes. Hope you'll work upon this.
"Great music, some technical difficulties. There's a ton of great artists and songs on this app. I love the options and how easy it is to make playlists. Sometimes my Spotify will not connect to the internet even when I have mobile LTE. That can be very frustrating, especially when the playlists I've downloaded are suddenly no longer downloaded. Overall, I love this app. But recently the above issues have made me question continuing to pay for it."
"The app is great but could use a lot of work. The built-in music player is horrible, only if there was a way to play audio through my Samsung Music App"
"I miss some more advanced settings. It's too user friendly. (Same applies to PC UI UX) There is space for improvement. Otherwise it's cool like you can sit in a bathroom with your phone and see what's playing on the PC next room. Search is very fast for mainstream songs. Easy to create playlists. Everything works more or less very quick. Anyways you know that already, as - everything I'm saying."
"Solid app, only flaw is it closes down in the background quite quickly which can have odd effects if casting or playing on Sonos or similar. Didn't get this issue on other music services"
Mostly good. IMO they should give the thumbs down option in all the screens and learn from user feedback. It is an option in some screens and not others. Quite good at picking what you like but nothing like as good as Last FM.
This app is great if you subscribed to Spotify premium. There are however a few issues for me that's quite annoying like: - Opening the app and suddenly finding my downloaded music/playlists not being recognized as downloaded so I have to connect back to the internet and redownload them (the good thing is that you dont really have to redownload but the app just has to re-read the existing downloaded files and it only takes several seconds) - Volume control unavailable on active mobile device
Its mostly quite good recomendations are useful but the whole skipping songs being a privilage is stupid like i shouldnt pay money to skip or select certain songs if you dont have premium it can be an extremely annoying app
It's cool. It's a good music app. Lots of music. I might have confused it because it can't quiet pin down what kind of music I like. I just wish when it said 15 or 30 minutes of add free music it meant 15 or 30 minutes. I timed it. It does not. I still highly recommend.
"Finally, Spotify is in India. I was feeling so guilty to use their app for free by using cracked versions for over a year now. Thanks Spotify, I love you guys. You make my day happy everyday. Edit : Giving 4 stars now because of the following reasom, still love the app though, but when is the Warner catalogue returning to Spotify? Most of my favorite artists are signed with Warner Music/Chapell. At least give us a date or something Spotify."
"In terms of catalog and quality of music available, it's probably best in class. The android app, and by extension probably also the desktops apps, have a pretty terrible UX. Trying to figure out how to do something pretty straightforward can be quite difficult at times. The family plan is good value though and is good to be able to disable explicit content for your kids. One feature I'd like to see is content whitelisting for my kids."
"Very amazing app have been using premium for quite a while, would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that some music that used to be there, I can no longer listen to, I can still see it on my downloads but I cannot play to it as it's no longer on Spotify I guess? it's confusing and sad."
"It's a really nice and neat app with good UI and nice curated playlist recommendations. However there are some songs that aren't available in my region (India) and that's kind of a bummer to have to go to YouTube for one song. Also, I think they should rethink their prices if they actually want to sell premium especially in India"
Everything is great except when I pay for premium and download songs it still uses y data to listen to them unless I specifically go into offline mode. Just bad design.
"I love it, but quite a few songs that i would like to play aren't on the app or are just unavailable for me. I don't quite know why this is. Overall I'm happy with Spotify."
"Great app but it seems to have slowed down quite a bit. Searching, playing songs, everything. Same experience with LTE network and on my WiFi at home (fibre optic)"
"Hey spotify.. The app's super cool with around 99% of songs being covered, ever been recorded.. Appreciate that! But i would like to bring a glitch into your notice.. Whenever you listen to songs while you device's screen is locked, and an app pops out.. (non premium account).. Tha plaback stops, until and unless you really unlock the screen and open the app.. This interrupts the seamless flow and is quite irritating.. please see through this.. except that... Stupendous App! :)"
"Spotify has a pretty wide range of songs of good hearing quality, but it's biggest flaw is it's awful UI design, the rest is absolutely fine."
A awesome app that is able to search for any songs you are looking for. Would prefer if there is a section or button to allow us adding our lyrics into our own playlist.
I've had Spotify premium for quite a while now and I love that I can download endless amounts of music as I drive all day and don't always have cell service (plus those data rates would be insane!) however there is no longer a widget for Samsung and it's not possible to sort the artists you have downloaded in alphabetical order like you could a few months ago. Why Spotify? Why? Let me sort my downloaded artists so it's easier to find what I want!
Great app. Think the interface could be more intuitive. Things are hidden and buried too much. also many features of Pandora app are better imo. Still great tho.
Updated to 4* for bringing back the android widget. Leaving off the last one as a reminder: Don't waste your customer's time having to downgrade and disable updates to keep a necessary feature. I bet the developers knew there would be backlash and a manager thought they knew better. Replace that person with someone who understands UX.
"Lately, especially with podcasts, if my phone screen is locked, Spotify with stop playing unless I unlock my screen. This is quite annoying. Otherwise, it's get a 5/5."
"it's good in the sense that u can have a wide variety of songs, which are of good quality. (the ads are actually quite tolerable). however, can Spotify pls fix their shuffle play system? like it doesn't even shuffle play, more of repeating the songs that you've heard already in your playlist. pls fix this Spotify üòï"
"Love love love this app is the only thing I dislike is if your premium ran out to you have to deal with all the commercials and you only have so many skips but that's why I pay for premium which is definitely worth it especially the offline mode I have yet to find a song that they do not have, actually quite the opposite I have found many, many many songs because of a Spotify!!!"
"Pretty fast, but UI has shuffle pay button too prominent for premium users and switching to other songs by same artist is much harder than with web player (which is disabled for mobile users)."
"The new UI design needs work, some of the functions are basically hidden such as Podcast and a the to access music genres. The music algorithm also requires improvement, the playlists displayed on the main tab of the app should be customizable, ignoring genres you don't listen to and showing accurate recommendations of something that you might find interesting, instead to adding list with ""hot"" music that's is not related with the music you actually listen to on the app."
Good app. But search is not untuitive. A slight spelling mistake does not show intended artist or song - even one character out of place messes the search.
"Best music app I've used from Apple music, tidal, SoundCloud and play. Occasionally they have bugs but fixed quickly and the recommendations are always spot on. Easy to navigate and to find the music you want. One thing I will mention - if you have a Samsung phone and have optimise battery usage turned on for the app in settings - the app can cut out when the phone locks - this bug showed up for me a few months ago and was annoying until I turned off the setting. App works perfectly again now."
Only worth 3+ stars if you have premium. One thing I do have to complain about is the terrible song suggestions and auto playlists. The app is otherwise convenient and quite enjoyable.
"The fact that they removed the widget in the newest update is absolute garbage. Obviously they can have a widget, obviously quite a few people liked it. Skipping songs is now a lot more work. EDIT: added 2 star due to widget return"
If anyone could please add a add to the queue feature directly from a playlist otherwise it's quite annoying finding the album of the song then adding it . Besides that everything is good.
"Songs will stop playing sometimes when playing with screen off. I've downloaded the song, so it's not buffering. Please fix this as it's quite annoying."
"One start less for not including lyrics üò¨. Besides this the app is fantastic. I love music and this is the perfect app for me. I love its UI, its very smooth."
"Getting worse and worse. i havent been quite happy with the different changes over the year, but since i mostly used the widget it was fine by me. now ut has been removed and i can't for the life if me understanding why. i guess this gives me a gokd reason to really consider using Google Play Music now since I'm paying for both anyway i may as well use the one with the better experience even if it's not seeing updates anymore. Edit: it's back, I'm happy again"
It's been about 2 years since I used Spotify for the first time. I started with free the changed to premium and it's been good for every purpose. One thing I would like you to add is a search button in the playlists section. (The one that's in the options)
Everything is great except the fact you can't block a particular artist in general from ever playing at all on any station. For example. I absolutely positively HATE & LOATHE ENTIRELY with every atom in my body Taylor Swift her voice is enough to make me suicidal and her lyrics make me hate her mother who should of used a condom. And yet it is the main thing I miss from my old music app that you can choose to NEVER hear from artists again even if they are just featured in a song.
"Very good app for music on the go. Only thing is the user interface is not intuitive. I have difficulty navigating it. The LIKED button should also give us an option to place the song in different albums we created. As when you have 500 favorite songs all in one folder, it's difficult to sort them into individual album subsequently."
It was all good but too much ads. And this might quite big request that I think we all should be able to listen to any songs that we want that might not be in our playlist. If you understand me
Initial sign up Trial version highly rated. If you need a stream to entertain at a gathering then get the account and divide with 5 others will be worth the ¬£3/month. Utilise the mixing option in settings= no track gaps.. Build your playlists in logical order as moving them around after isnt easy at all... Sound quality adjustable and differs with different devices. All in all a great non speaking auto DJ set can be run by Spotify..
"It's the best music app on this planet. although, the past 2 or 3 weeks, it pauses whenever i lock my phone... it's quiet annoying and idk how to fix that."
"Meticulously designed and fast app but is missing music, especially if you dont just listen to recent English pop music. Usually doesn't even show you missing music (greyed out or whatever), just pretends songs don't exist, when they damn well know they do. You should add the ability to stream torrents."
Been using Spotify premium for years. Never really had a problem except the native/web client doesn't work on Linux. Apart from that I like building playlists and being able to share and collaborate with friends
Awesome!!!! Loving it. Got the widget for Android but it lacks Equalizer so proposing a Poweramp type amplifier inbuilt into the native app or the option to play spotify premium through poweramp unlocked player.
I think that multiple profiles in an account will improve the application. A common problem I experience is that when I give someone my phone to put music in the car and he puts the songs he wants it ruins the algorithm. Someway to disable the algorithm when needed will be good.
"Very wonderful way of listening to music. Very intuitive, I just wish there were a little bit more features"
"The app is pretty good, but I have few things. Firstly we got family mix, which is premium, but I still get spotify premium popup ads and it's kind of a pain. Also the hide this song ban button has disappeared (although I still have a list of songs I've previously hidden) and that's also very annoying. Please fix."
"Great music streaming app with one of the best UI, and much faster than any other app that I ever used. Waited for so long to get spotify and it didn't disappoint me, good collection and lot of new genre's to discover."
"It's clean and simple to use, and has a huge variety. I'm quite impressed by that, actually, because I wasn't sure they'd have much of what I like, but I've found a lot of my favourite songs on here. They handle ads pretty well, and though I wish I could download without paying, I think that's fair. My only complaint is that sometimes it's hard to find songs unless you know the exact title. But you can easily just look that up elsewhere before looking for the actual song here."
A truly great music streaming service. I love the ability to create my own playlists and being able to listen to new musicians. Spotify passed my standard test of having lots of classical music by Ginastera and the two discs released by the young singer/songwriter and bass guitar player Tal Wilkenfeld. My one grumble (hence only 4-stars) is that there are only MP3 files to download and no FLAC files.
"It's a good app, but why don't you put the settings button at the Your Library menu too? It's such a hassle to always go to the home menu just to go into settings. And also please put the swipe to add to queue function like on ios!!! Why do we have to compromise with all the features? Shouldn't it be the same??"
Fantastic ui and even more personalisation settings are in user's hands but i think you should include more languages than just indian ones like korean for eg. Also inclusion of lyrics in all songs will be great.
I love this app. I have Premium and I love it. I love features like live lyrics and storyline but the UI is very clunky. I know it's difficult to design and program an app this complex but it needs a new design.
Lost a star. Recent update has removed the quick option buttons in the discography that was great for adding albums to playlists without having to go into the album.
"I'm loving this app all my music is here. I am a premium member and I am asking for an update where get themes, I like the color but it is getting old. You can have Spotify designed themes and also let the public design it and you can decide to put in the app. I really want to change the color please make it happen."
"This could definitely improve. Random stops, UI confusing somethimes, IE heart and unlike/ skip not consistent. I realize some lists/ radio doesn't have unlike, but the heart is on the opposite side then? long time paid user and every update over the years just doesn't end up with just a simple solid pleasant experience. If it is supposed to be a learning algorithm then i don't see why like/ dislike is available everywhere. And with dislike please have the algorithm figure out artist or song."
"Comparatively better apps, but need to improve. In android no preview of songs of album, so you need only forward button to see next song. You can't play the desired song directly from album. So need to update. Songs collection are very good. No radio station preview in android phone."
"Love the app! BUT PLEASE bring back the on/offline button in the notification bar with Android! It's very useful! Also have troubles connecting with Alexa, seeing forward to a solution :)"
I love this app and use it literally every day; but im not the biggest fan of the last update's redesign of how to find specific songs in my library; i liked just being able to scroll down and have a search bar!
"Superb music app!! Only change which SERIOUSLY needs attention is the placement of the ""download"" switch located right next to the shuffle button. Horrible!! I have undownloaded my songs several times already. Please fix this! Thanks"
"Its great and all but they should make it like on pc. Because whenever I want to play a different song it doesnt let me, and on the pc it did. And how do I not play recommended songs, it can be quite annoying."
I had to download an older version of Spotify because you guys messed the app up so much and ruined it in the last update. Saved me from switching to another music streaming app.
"Pretty good I'm on the free version currently, and it's really good! With the exception of a large chunk of game music, it has all I like on there, and I like niche music. Really good, no issues. Recommended Edit: now on premium (perfectly fine, no ploblems) and have suffered through 2 different design changes, this is fine but having the option to switch back would be nice."
"I love the app! Best music streaming app to my experience so far! There are so many genres and specific playlists, absolutely recommend it. My only problem, since the last update, keeps crashing for me. It happens when the app isn't open and music is playing in the background, when the app is open, when I'm connected to a bluetooth speaker or just using the phone's speaker. This is quite annoying and apparently quite common. Please fix this in a next update!"
"Loads of songs, lots of podcasts. Interface could be updated and missing features like auto download and smart build playlists"
This is by far the best musical streaming service out there. And the app is well designed and function's without a hitch. I give it 4 stars as they took away the Spotify widget which was very convenient to use.
"Sometimes I try to intuitively select a song and make it play, but for some reason I hear another song. I would like to have an ad after 5 or 10 songs to suggest a song based on my favorite ones or something and not like the current process."
Overall a good app. Smooth UI and good selection of music. My one complaint is that when you make a Playlist Spotify adds their own recamended songs.
"Spotify is great. One suggestion: if you guys adjust library tab to be more compact and quicker to access, it will be great. Great job anyway."
"Love the app! The free version is more than enough for me. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars, is because I can't change the home ""landing page"" from music to podcasts. Other than that - I have no complaints. I love the fact that you have the ability to create a playlist for listening to podcast episodes from different shows in the order you want. The interface is clear & simple, yet intuitive. Overall - brilliant app!"
"Great collection of songs, playlists, and beautiful UI. But please add more Indian songs as other music apps have, especially the old ones which are sadly missing in your app."
Personally I think Spotify is the best streaming option in the current market. The app design can be a little wonky at times though.
The app isnt super intuitive and sometimes featurs you use will disappear. The service works pretty well though and the integration with podcasts and rxtensive music library is pretty great.
"A few bugs, such as the music stopping when the screen is off for some time then continuing to play and the widget of spotify going woosh. But really worth it"
"I really like Spotify and it's support of so many plattforms (IOS, Android, Windows, OSX, Linux). I don't listen to Podcasts but I do enjoy listening to new music; ""Discover Weekly"" and ""Release Radar"" are perfect for me therefor. The only thing i don't like is, that I can't configure or edit my ""Daily Mixtapes"" e.g. renaming or setting a genre for this Mixtape."
"the settings button isn't were it should be (Library) (I also would like a way to select multiple songs, Playlist or albums so I can for example download all of them without having to kick on each one)"
"Absolutely love this app. However, wish you can remove a song from a playlist easier when it comes up. Such as a ""remove from current playlist button"""
"Even with the limitations on their library in my country Spotify still manages to deliver a great listening experience that's pretty satisfying overall. However, there are a few UI elements that I find annoying. For example why is the search option under liked songs hidden instead of having it directly above the list of songs like it is in the iOS version of Spotify. Hope you guys make that change soon."
"It is a very good app but I have some issues with this app and there are some songs that are unplayable like BTS ""ddaeng"", & Red Velvet's ""Peek a boo"" was not there that's why I'm soo furious that I can't play my fravrouite songs. So please I have a request that please fix the issues."
"The premium app is great: good sound quality, offline listening and the huge song database. However I gave only 4 stars (which is like 3.5) due to the fact that this app lacks a lot of gestures - you actually have to tap the song that is playing instead of swiping up to bring the song, same goes for minimising the song from fullscreen: you have to tap the icon which is on top left corner or press the back button - instead of swiping down like it would be normal (a pain for users with big screen)"
"I really wish that they added a quick easy way to queue songs. For example, on iPhones you can just swipe right on the song"
The big update was not optimal but I've gotten used to it. I still miss my 'Recently Played'. The app still has a nice design but I miss the old Spotify.
"Great app. You can listen to music anywhere and create your own playlists. The only problem is the ads. Some of them are quite long, and it keeps pushing you to get premium."
Its a little hard to get around. Still not really that intuitive. Great playlists though. The moving backgrounds are really cool.
Overall great app but please bring back the widget. Quality of life has been greatly decreased. I can still use the app but removing the widget removed my ease of access. It is the equivalent of pooping without toilet paper. Functionally you can still poop but you will have a hard time trying to wipe your butt. üí©
"great selection of music. simple and easy to use interface. would give 5 stars if they just fix it being quiet over bluetooth. 3rd phone with spotify, every one same story I have to turn up my volume to about 30% higher than any other app."
"the service itself is excellent. It's not quite 5 stars though because Spotify does not have live stations like Apple Music, which would make it 6 stars. Get ON IT Spotify!"
"I love this app, it's absolutely brilliant. HOWEVER I'm a bit frustrated with there being so many explicit songs ... adding the radio edit/non-explicit versions would earn 5 stars for sure! With having young ears around, and quite honestly the preference not to listen to the explicit versions, there's quite a few great songs we can't choose üò¢"
"The app updated itself while i was asleep and in the process, it removed its widget from my home screen and there is no sign of it anywhere to put it back. After logging a live chat with a very nice operative, it seems this might be an android issue but being caught early gives them a chance to hopefully fix it quickly. Other apps would benefit greatly from following their quality of service."
"Great app. Fluid, smooth but very difficult to find songs in search bar. Suggestions are just irrelevant."
"I wish that I could say that the app is worst and boring as M very ctitic abt any app but to my expectations and experience the app is very great in music catalogue; with ample of options you can customise your listing features, etc beyond. Best part is that youre having the advertisement for less than 15 sec for free versions which may be aftr an hour or so.. But this app can do better by (a)Premium version are very heavy on pockets(b)GUI improvements(c)offline in free versions(d)Battery saver."
great app. great selection. great features. TEDIOUS to build Your library. time consuming to build your library. needs more sweeping selection methods to add or remove albums or songs into and out of your library. similar to a PC being able to select multiple files(songs) or folders(albums) @ a time
"So...I never liked spotify and I thought it was pointless , but after I bought the premium it's much better , you can do so many things and you can listen to so many songs! I didn't give it 5 stars because I can't see all the songs of an artist (unless they have ""This is..."") and it's kinda annoying. Also , sometimes when I open other apps (like Instagram) Spotify closes you need yo fix that quick it's so annoying!! To sum up it's a very good application if you buy the premium!"
"Loading times can be retro-legth on some devices, taking you back all the way to the 90s. Otherwise mostly well designed app."
"Great selection, smooth UI, ads are annoying if you don't have premium, and for some reason this recent update got rid of the spotify widget? I dunno."
"From the last update I'm having a issue, if I reply with a txt message or answer a call the music doesn't come back up quite frustrating to reopen the app and play it again."
"Awesome, but where's my widget? I just recently updated the app and the widget for Android phones is gone. Did Spotify get rid of it? Other than that, i love the app. so easy to navigate and get to music quickly.. even without my widget."
"Don't remove the widget. It makes changing songs quick and easy while working, cooking, bicycling. I use it all the time. That's the only reason for the 4 stars. Or I would have given it a 5"
it gives quite a wide spectrum of songs to choose from but there are songs that are available in other country's version of Spotify but not India's.
"The new update which messes about with the ""your library"" section feels disjointed and unpolished to say the least. It is bad enough that this redesigned area basically removes the recently played section but what it replaces with it is functionally inadequate. It now defaults to displaying playlists rather than the saved music library which adds unnecessary friction to the experience. Also, this update is incredibly poorly optimised, and slow. True garbage. Don't role the change out."
I just have one problem. The Instagram Stories share feature is not always available. It comes and goes as it pleases which is quite irritating so please fix this issue. Otherwise the app is amazing!
Somewhat better music selection than Amazon music. Not quite as intuitive as Pandora. More usage time will determine my go to music streaming platform.
"Spotify is great! love the personalised recommendations the app throws up based on my listening preferences, that's cool. Good to see the vast library Spotify has built over the years, but has to be said - the Indian collection is rather poor. You need more, Spotify, you can't take over the Indian market with your current collection."
"love it discovered so many new bands! only complaint I have is I use it in my car a lot and I keep getting "" click now to watch a short video. and get 30 minutes of ad free music"" kinda a hassle to have a push button add when driving."
"The app is good but the volume is quite low. For example, if I watched a song on YouTube and I listened the same song on Spotify, the volume is way more less than YouTube. Please fix these if possible & tbh, I downloaded this app because of it's peer pressure. Otherwise I was pretty used to my regular playlist on my phone's default music app."
I've switched from IOS to Android and one of the few things that made me regret the most is the fact that I can't swipe to queue on Spotify. Like this fact alone made me very upset as such a feature made life so easy with Spotify. Please hear our pleas as Android users who wanted to seperate from Apple's design redundancy and grant us our wish.
spotify is so great. nearly perfect. it seems like the shuffle button doesn't truly shuffle your library. I have thousands of songs saved and usually hear the same two or three hundred.
"this is the best music app i have ever used ;the recommendations and radios are awesome, but i have recently encountered some issues if there is an advertisement and we multitask with the button the ad wont go away even if we click cancel and it would instead controll the background one other small issue is that when you flip your phone it will go to landscape mode and pop right back to portrait mode spotify lite has landscape mond so why not the standard version?"
"Great app, great service but the UI could be more responsive and the new search(with recomendations) kind of sucks, because you have to click one more time to get the actual search bar The UI is changed too often. Followed artist aren't categorized alphabetically."
I would give five stars but there are quite a few remixes and covers that are very popular and spotify does not have them. This may be due to a liscencing or copyright issue but if it is a simple oversight i would love to see it corrected.
Great music app to find new spirit rising music of different genres across various artists... It has a nice intuitive UI w/ dark theme... Creates a nice background when sharing our favorite music through stories... NIFTYüòÅ
"Samsung S10 : the videos are annoying (does anyone actually use that feature, no one I know does), frequently requires me to unlock phone so spotify can reconnect to internet, but still the best music/podcast app out there"
"Everything works properly and the ""Daily mix"" makes everyday just perfect for me. But I can't find the repeat or shuffle buttons though it's available in other countries."
I've had spotify for a very long time and I love it but it recently updated and i no longer have the button for 30 minutes of ad free music. Im also a little dissapointed that there are so many ads now and when you get 30 minutes of add free music its a lie because it plays like 5 ads then after 4 songs it plays andother add if my issue could be fixed that would be great
Great mix of music. One thing I would like is a way to export listening history (e.g as a csv or spreadsheet). This would allow easy collation of podcast listening for things like continuing professional development.
"App is great, battery consumption is quite high though even when not in use and putting it to sleep doesn't allow for proper background playback."
"Just started my premium subscription today after a few weeks of continually using the free experience. Satisfied so far. Good work Spotify. I do think $12 a month is slightly higher than I'd really like to pay. Let's see how many playlists I can make during my trial I guess EDIT: Can you add a ""play next"" button. So it adds the item to the start of the Queue rather than the end. This would be a perfect feature for Spotify as I am someone that constantly queues songs and albums all day long"
"Pls bring back the option where you can search the song in the album or the Playlist. I'm lazy.. Okay.. The filter search, I think thats The one... The search bar in the Playlist so you can search the song in that Playlist. Bring it back.. Cmon... But this app is good. The juicy stuff.fantastic.... No problem with. Execpt the search bar, the one I'm saying before"
"I haven't had quite the issues other users have but removing the playlist count was a big misstep. Also, adding your own playlist photo should be allowed. Another big name streaming app allows it"
"You remove Radio, my playlists can't be sorted on mobile and my recently played can't be found easily. Moreover, there's no quick option to enable Private session."
"app is great. Being in india cant find this much english songs at any other app so its great, uses less data, UI is ok not that great, there should have been an option to change sequence of song in your playlist like if the song is at 10th place in playlist we could change it to 1st or any other place,Thanks"
"I used spotify online, which lead to the correct version for linux. If your using linux its not the easiest to get up and running but a decent service when its working."
"Its a good app,tho i cant listen to the music i want when i search it up i can only seem to be able to listen to a preview of the song,i find this quite annoying."
Great app but missing a couple of options. Would really like to be able to search my library based on genre enabling me to make a quick playlist based on my mood.
"As a newbie to Spotify Premium I am agreeing to make an initial review of the application I am quietly impressed with the range of music offered within the genre definitions I have a very eclectic taste in music as a result of spanning many years exploring many genres. I do have a cultured ear, so I am rather fussy So far I have found Spotify to be consistent with such a fussy music fan such as myself"
music good quality and good selection. a better user interface is sorely needed. you need a stop and off buttons. its a nightmare to switch the thing off !! f
"I love the recent change to Loved songs and albums! I regularly experience UI hangs that aren't freezing, nor do they seem to be related to data connection, as it happens on wifi and cell. Sometimes clearing cache helps, but not always."
please make it more seemless to use the library by giving back the pull down to filter/search bar. having to go look for the search function is poor app design at its peak
"Good application and service, although it has rather confusing UI (also on desktop). There is a list of songs being played, but the is also a separate play queue. at different times these have different priority, which means is sometimes hard to play the song you actually want to hear..."
the new update kinda sucks. I wish they would go back to the last layout. My artists arent in alphabetical order and it's difficult easily find who I'm looking for quickly. I have to slowly scroll through reading every name instead of just scrolling quickly to the first letter of their name and them being right there
"Fantastic application whether on desktop or mobile, however it's very tiring when they basically do a full makeover of the UI. It's really annoying that I need to re learn where to find everything. Pick a layout and stick with it please."
"Really liking Spotify, but the new UI sucks. As long as I can listen to all my songs though it's fine, and I don't really care."
"It is a great app, with better UX than most apps (including the most popular apps). It is easy to get a hang off, and easy and quick to use. The inability to quickly save songs and queue songs (like when on the run), at least on Android, does make it a lot more annoying. In general, I wish the Android widget wouldn't be so awkward, and it is hard to find previous songs you've heard on all the different versions."
"Discover Weekly is usually good once the app knows what you like. I find a song or two almost everytime, but the UI needs improvement. Spotify also needs to find a balance between promoting new acts, the classics, and popular mainstream artists. Too much mainstream music sometimes."
"Excellent UI, Excellent Sound Quality. Purchased premium on day 1 of usage. But I loved the previous logo of Spotify without the black border. The newer one is not as attractive as earlier one."
app is good but it's better when there are basic options like repeat button available in free version and plus music from all artist are still lacking I'm spotify if these problems were resolved then this app be the best free music streaming service across the globe
Amazing app but the UI needs a lot of work to make the UX better. And you guys really need to listen to the suggestions of the users on your feature message boards better.
amazing app however there is a requirement of adding more songs asap although they have been promised. One can discover more artists on Spotify as compared to other apps. Therefore 4/5.
"I've been using Spotify for over 5 year. It's very intuitive. Although I'm not a fan of the new layout, I will continue using it. I also wish that they would work out a deal with Jay Z so i could listen to his music on this platform"
always found any song. think the GUI could be improved for finding tracks seem to be swiping alot maybe smaller icons or a flow chart approach.
"Spotify app (paid) is better than the others I feel. crashes less and or easy to navigate. The suggestion engine is much better than others (such as tidal/deezer/apple/youtube for example), it's a fun experience to check out new stuff. The overall audio quality is okay however the spotify applied pre audio sampling isn't really built for heavy metal. I was hoping for flac quality though, or the ability to stop the minor fade-in with tracks."
"The app is great for most devices, but sometimes there are technical issues when you connect it to your car via Bluetooth or other apps designed for it"
"Manually turn Car View ON I love that there's a Car View mode. Makes navigating through songs so much easier while driving. But the problem is, why isn't it available for AUX cable users?! That's pretty absurd if you ask me. So only cars with Bluetooth can drive more safe? Please include a manual toggle in the next update. For safer driving! I've suggested this already in Ideas too so if anyone is on there, do give my idea a vote up! üòä"
"1. Sometimes, after the ad is over a pic of the ad is displayed on top of screen of app and it freezes with the buttons showing 2 buttons(""Watch Now"" and below that ""Dismiss""). If I swipe or click or do whatever on the screen the screen works for everything except the ad. I can swipe up/down playlists, click on the now playing tab The ad does not display when Im on the Now Playing screen, but on moving to Home, it displays. I can't remove it unless I restart the app! 2. Add a queue Please help."
"I really like the weekly personalized mixes, the genre separated daily playlists, among the fact that until now there was no song that I couldnt find on spotify ( direct linking with Shazam is great ). The things i dont like are: 1. that the button to save songs for offline mode is sometimes really hidden 2. with locked screen ( Android - S10 ) the buttons should be bigger, hard to switch songs."
spotify has almost every song i eant to listen to except for some japanese anime songs which i like to hear now i can't even access my music anymore due to whatever you did to my songs it was alot easier just to push library button hit songs and my music played pls fix problem by morning need my music
"Overall good experience. However, its missing 'Shuffle' option in playlist. Its the basic required feature in any music player app."
Love how the new functionality came through. Still would like some updates to the UI for one handed friendly use. The options menu while in a playlist or on a song to be relocated to the bottomof the screen. Can be switched with the device option that's bottom left. That isn't used as the functionality in the options menu list.
"I really like Spotify. Quick to access, very nice quality and a broad range of music, theme songs, and even old radio shows too an extent. I recommend it!"
It's a very good streaming service. it seems to have a few over sites in its design compared to the iOS version of Spotify like you you need to use a menu to search through a playlist rather than scrolling to the top of the page but has been steadily getting improvements over the last few years
"everything is good, music base, UI, everything, just add one thing in it. thumbnails beside the songs. it feels very cumbersome to identify songs when i want to listen ASAP"
"Would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the new UI. Also, artists can no longer be sorted alphabetically. Just made Spotify look so complicated. i hope they fix this. The previous UI was sooooo much better and is very user friendly. was expecting an upgrade but boyyy was that a downgrade lol"
"The only issues I have a quirky things. Like clicking on an artist and it goes to the screen with nothing showing, or I switch apps for half a second and it shuts down, then takes a while to reboot. Overall I am very satisfied."
"PLEASE FIX!!!! i have premium and my downloaded music keeps undownloading, where i need to keep connecting to wifi for it to re-download. I'm connected to wifi every day so it's not that 30 day thing. it's quite annoying and I'm travelling soon and don't want half my music to disappear before my flight. I've got a samsung s8+ with all updated software."
"the the only reason I'm not giving this app five stars is that once you have a lot of songs in your library, it is rather difficult sometimes to find them alphabetically they are stored in the order in which you acquire them, which can be cumbersome."
"Its a great app to use for music/podcasts etc. I had an issue with my login but the customer service team sorted it out quickly. The only 2 annoying things would be that not all types of music are available (may not be spotifys fault) I have also have had issues where my downloaded playlists are ""not downloaded"" out of the blue, which means I have to redownload them which can time consuming. Other than that, I have been a customer since 2013 and I use this app almost everyday :)"
"Great!! Love the ability to download music, and use this on any device! I just wish it had the lyrics of the song in a drop down bar, that would be quite nice"
"The ""offline"" status toggle in the android pull down menu has disappeared. It was such an easy way  to change to offline mode for a brief periode (e.g. When someone at home started listening Spotify on Google home or when on a train,..). You just had to pull down the notification menu and in the easy acces buttons there was a ""offline"" button. Now it's gone. Anybody else having this issue?"
"It's really good,I enjoy listening while reading watty srories but something change and I don't like it.My playlist change and when I press the play button,only the chorus will play."
a Good Listening Experience and I can Discover new songs that is considered under my taste of music. It's great overall just needs a few tweaks in the UI to make it more Appealing
Is there a way to toggle Car Mode manually? My app won't toggle to Car Mode automatically when it connects to my car's Bluetooth. It's not a car with built in Bluetooth. I'm using the Anker Roav Bolt.
Good app even without premium you can build playlists and listen to the music that you want it does not have all of the groups that I would like but it still is a good app.
"Good for discovering new music based on what you like, otherwise it's not that useful and inconvenient. I want to play my list only without random music being thrown in it,that would make me much happier.The ads definitely ruin the experience,as they're badly placed"
"Intuitive and easy to use. It converted me, an aging vinyl dinosaur, into a digital diva within days. I know now what all the young folks were making a fuss over."
"as a premium customer, i really love the simplicity and user experience of this app. However on downloaded songs, would love to have filter by language and genre options."
I love the app itself. The UI is uncomplicated and it's easy to discover new music. One star deducted because on Android the app is glitchy. There is constant crashing and the music will stop playing at random and require an app restart.
Great if you have a premium account like me but the ads quickly ruin the whole experience especially when it makes you watch an ad for 30mins ad free music and then it plays 1 song and another ad. A nice large selection of all types of artists however you may find if difficult to find some classics and such and the playlists share is diabolical and don't get me started on the basically none existing ability to find a friends playlist even with the playlist name and your friends account name.
"Listen to music through Spotify all day every day. Works great most of the time, but sometimes disconnects when I stream through cromecast. The design of the latest update is hard to get used to, and I would love to be able to customize my view."
Excellent app. like the app very much...my suggestion is add refresh button so we can interact to our song that we've searched for. Thank you. user interface is amazing ‚ô•Ô∏èüëåüèº
I'm really enjoying this app a lot with all the default playlists to suit every mood and other stuff. It would be great if it displayed the lyrics too along with every song.
An awesome app. Its UI is the best for any music streaming app. Would've given it 5 stars if it could buffer less in areas with slow networks. Cheers!!
"This app has the most wide ranged songs and the playlists are great. However, in the Indian version there is no shuffle button for specific playlists."
"The only thing I can really think of to add is that when I put a song on repeat I want that to carry over to when I go to the next song instead of having to hit the ""play on repeat"" button again."
Almost the design and User Interface is very good and High Quality Songs too. but there is no Lyrics option. I hope that feature will exists in the upcoming update. ü§©
"I love spotify. it's the go to music app. be careful if you have a play button on your headphones or earphones. if you click it and you currently aren't playing something, spotify will start playing music. that is the only reason why I'm giving it a 4."
"Generally a good app but not always intuitive to use. also, I wish spotify would state what the changes are in their updates instead of just saying making improvements, bug fixes etc."
After the last update the design of the app has been improved significantly but some usability changes are horrible such as I need a 3 step process to search for a song in liked songs (on IOS you just pull down the list and a search bar appears) on here you need to push a 3 dot menu then push search for a song and finally after that type the title. This is just time consuming and not user friendly. Please just change it! Also I feel like that app start been more sluggish...
"playlist creation and downloaded songs removal could use some work, all I want is a ""select multiple"" button. but overall wonderful app, the best actually."
Great BUT... I hate the fact that the free user UI on Android looks way better than those who pay for premium like myself. I would suggest the same or a better interface for us premium users.
User friendly. I enjoy but wish the premium account would allow you to use on multiple devices. At home I use my tablet at work I would like to be able to use my phone. I made an inquiry more than 7 days ago and have yet to get a response from Spotify.
Everything here is amazing. A UI change would be great. Please add the animation on the lock screen plus make it landscape again. Thank you!
One of the best UI's ever used for music apps. Would be wonderful if licence issues get resolved quickly and we can stream all the artists like Clean Bandit and Muse.
The application is very intuitive and is good. The only issue I am facing is that the hidden songs on a playlist are still being played for some reason.
dont understand why I can no longer remove an artist from my artist list????? a little irritating but other then that pretty good app. love that I can listen to shuffle or a single album but the normal volume us kinda quiet with my phone turned all the way up. but great app!
"Well worth the money! The app features are a bit difficult to use. Seniors, particularly have a hard time using the app; a basic feature button would benefit those who are not computer savvy. How do I reorder the songs in a playlist? otherwise app deserves 5 stars."
"excellent generally. just a few slightly annoying niggles, such as constant little updates on layout and not as intuitive to delete queued songs."
Life changing for someone stuck in his collection of 80's cds and who hates listening to radio. Love it. It would be awesome if there were skip controls on the shuffle play page and option to create playlist from queue page. Also it would be grest to be able to skip songs with double click of volume button on phone. Then it would be 10 stars.
"Been using this service for years as a premium member. Recently upgraded my plan to include Hulu amd couldn't be happier about that. The interface can be a bit cluttered on mobile platforms (hence the non 5 star review) but this doesnt ruin the experience at all, in my honest opinion."
I have had Spotify for quite a while and I would recommend the product from a consumer standpoint but not from an artist standpoint. I do admire the service and I do frequently use it.
"Canvas Idea, please add an option or a button to disable the canvas for the current song. Like somewhere in the current song interface/screen that we don't have to go to the settings and disable canvas affecting all songs. I want some canvas for some songs but not all of them."
"for some reason, it stopped working on the lock screen (Samsung s9). I have to drag down the notifications menu to manipulate the buttons in THAT menu rather than the lock screen menu. idk why, I'm reinstalling to see if it'll fix it."
"Once you go premium, this is the best music app in the Playstore in my oppinion. Vast selection of music plus a free Hulu account. Without premium it's hard to listen to what you want sometimes, but the adds aren't quite that annoying. Most adds come from spotify themselves."
"the only things i would change are 1) quit adding to the playlists being created by me... most are songs i dont even want cuz yall dont know me. 2) i was under the impression that this apo wiukd continue to play while working on other apps, which has hold mostly true...it stops when the camera is open, and during the use of most of the social media apps on my phone. Overall, better than pandora and youtube for sure."
"please try to include a simple WiFi only feature alongside the offline mode. i'll have to restrict background data until this is addressed. we shouldn't have to take such aggressive options to safeguard data usage. the offline feature is too over-encompassing. most users require the app to feed off hotspots, not their data plans."
"I love how I can find almost every songs that I want to listen. Also, loving the premium features especially listening offline. It saves my internet data, just download it once and then you can listen to it offline. The only downside is that the price for premium is quite pricey. Anyways, overall I am satisfied."
Love spotify. But it does get very annoying when it buffers. I'll press the pause button and the music is still playing in the background. I'll close spotify but the music is still playing! Gets old after a while.
"The mobile app is way worse than the desktop one, please make them the same, or bring them both to an equilibrium. Maybe rebalance the free version. Instead of shuffle only and not being able to play a specific song, add more ads. You get it. Otherwise epic app."
good music. easy search for songs/artists. i hope they bring in an optional feature like including the lyrics per song as they play (with an on/off button).
everything is good but it doesn't give lyrics to the music (as in 'ganna' app) . lyrics help us to make or sing properly. wish u could build that feature.
very good app . . better sound quality . . .and some songs are still not available in our region . please make them available soon! its been quite some time since the app was released in my country üòëüòï
love it! love that I can control my Computer speakers with my Smart watch! don't love the UI. kinda hard to just see all the songs an artist has posted without having to go through all the albums.
"i have the new update for the Galaxy S8. When my screen in locked, the pause, skip, and rewind buttons do not work. please fix"
Spotify is an excellent service. The playlists and AI curated playlists are vry well made and seem to always to get the right mood. the quality of the tracks are superb for digital copies. The UI is complete garbage however and seems to get progressively less intuitive. This is easily fixed and would make the experience a 5/5 one at that.
"Good app. Some original versions of songs are not available though, mostly revival. And sometimes, search button takes a long time to load"
Best app and personally my first choice for songs but the non premium users might face frustrating things such as limited number of skips or not being able to play full songs but only a few seconds and ton of ads on UI and between songs.
Not able to find a lot of English songs. Hoping that it would be fixed in the upcoming updates. Good recommendations for Telugu and Hindi songs. But need to increase the library of songs. Price for premium is a bit high. Understand that it is required to break even but would expect the prices for the premium facility to be reduced in the forseeable future
"Solid app but everytime I update, its a chance. The UI gets changed almost everytime and it gets annoying since I have grown accustomed to an older versions UI. You guys either gotta have an option to revert to an old UI or just pick one and stick with it."
"Exceptional, but needs search function update. Ive been putting off getting spotify premium for a long time. Being a YT Music user, i enjoy the quickness and accessibility of YT. But with Spotify i get more personalized stations, and also Ps4 access.. Only problem is how lanky it feels to search a song or artist. The search funtion just needs an update to make it more user friendly. Will most likely be canceling other subs for this still."
"Very good app, unfortunate that you can only choose what song you listen to in the desktop app and premuim. 4 stars because sometimes on the mobile app it adds other music to my playlist."
spotify is a great way to listen to and catalogue music you already know and love. I rarely run into issues with the app and any kinks are usually worked out very quickly.
Great but...of bcs i rate it 4 stars...when I press the top left button looking like this (V) when I press it...it shows an advertisement and I pressed dismiss it goes back to the song I am playing that's why I hated it *hmph*...(I hope Spotify sees this)
"I'd go for 5 stars except for: car mode in landscape is really random... the timeline bar should be further from the like/dislike buttons because 9 out of 10 times it's a miss. Can't find an easy way to go back into car mode if I exit it for any reasons. Can't ""unblock"" accidentally blocked songs in the playlists. And finally, Private Session should be more easily accessible."
"the only problem i have is related to spotify premium offer! I did all that was required of me to get one free month or 30 days premium promo. from spotify, but never got that offer to materialise for me yet may-be i did not clearly understand what was requested of me in order to qualify? Can someone tell me what i did wrong...?"
"Great experience yet the new update has a few hitches. For example, I wish the new player UI could work landscape like the former design, and when swiping album covers to skip, sometimes it displays ""you need premium to peek at the next song"" despite me already having premium."
"This app has been excellent until a few days ago when 5 of my daily mixes became cross contaminated with each other and the 6th one was filled with tons of bands not like anything else I listen to. I was going to go in to dislike all of the bands on the mix but the dislike button is gone and only the heart button remains. the dislike button is still present in the release radar and discover weekly, but not daily mixes. whatever happened in the last update is what caused this."
this last update (as of 4/3/2019) is all I could have asked for. 4 stars because i personally hate the car mode and wish i could turn it off in the settings vs having to hit two buttons every time I get into a car.
"Could be the perfect music app, if not for a terrible UI on Android. Who needs the stupid hide button in plain sight, and where are the repeat buttons?"
"really not fond of the new UI, the menu thing for a song (if you wanna see the artists details) is way too far up the screen. also, the heart is a little goofy as compared to the plus (you knew what the plus did intuitively, and didnt need goofy messages to tell you). Also that cheeky message that appears when you remove a song from the library appears everytime. gets old fast"
"I love this app. It's a great tool for finding music, building playlists and finding music that's similar to what you listen to but may not have heard. I would give you 5 stars, but I do have one issue. PLEASE pay artists more for their royalties and plays. They work hard and dedicate their lives to making music for people to listen to. Unless they a mainstream band, they are NOT making very good money."
"I'd like to see a much better interface an UX for podcasts. the potential is great, but at the moment i have a two key bug bears: 1. can we have the option to mark an entire podcast as played, rather than just individual buttons, sometimes i snooze a podcast and take a break, but the blue icon is difficult to then remove and be able to understand where i actually have new episodes 2. the ability to rate and review podcasts!! i want to see if a podcast is good, not presume just by its tile image"
"Everything about this is great. Very convenient. however, I'm in the beta program and the canvas option automatically switches off. please fix that. otherwise all songs sound amazing, UI is slick and most of all the song recommendations are amazing."
"Fantastic app, great UI and UX, pretty much any music you can think of, but need to pay artists more for their music. ‚Ç¨0.0006 per stream is ridiculous."
"Wish they kept more ""detailed"" info on what they do when they update and ""improve various aspects of the app"" i had trouble with this app for about a month. Since my Galaxy S9+ updated UI android 9.0 (or also called Android UI One for some reason) my bluetooth became unresponsive i really didn't want to Uninstall and Reinstall so i tried everything possible troubleshooting besides that but low and behold ONLY the Uninstall and Reinstall worked. THANKFULLY it worked just wish i new thata month B4"
"It's amazing easy with a simple design lesser ads, but the size is too big and exhaust's a lot of data and i think adding some playlists of new songs up a lil more to the front would be nice."
The application is really smooth and having access to all officially released content of the musicians I like is great. Spotify has a very intresting algorhythm for music suggestions; features like the Radio of a song/album and the Daily/Weekly Playlists are great and helped me find out some new artists. But however I like it's features and design there is a clear bias in what music genres are represented and promoted. Therefore it cannot be used as an exclusive personal music library for me.
"you know you're good. I love the application, but just if the UI(including the theme or not your choice) could be a lil bit better then the 19-20 would become 21. but no compromise with the sound performance; it is what i really love about your appüôÇ"
Everything is perfect except when I click on a song it opens the interface and whole UI shifts up for a sec for lyrics which is so damn irritating so hope you fix this.
"it really is amazing how much they can offer for such a cheap price there are some bugs now and then, like missing album art, spotify continuingly playing after closing the app or new released songs not being listed in the ""new releases"" even though they are already on Spotify But when they manage to fix those bugs, the app is flawless and recommended for everyone enjoying music"
"I've loved spotify for years now, it's my go-to app for music. Unfortunately it glitches quite a bit and in one of the updates they got rid of the search function in a playlist, now you always have to go to the settings of the playlist and then press 'find in playlist'.. It's a waste of time imo"
"Lots of songs are missing like Linkin park, SYML and many other artist so this is my request to you guys please put all the songs from various artist. And rest of the things are very very good and interface of app is so beautifully designed, color of the background is so good.. Great job guys love from india."
It suits me for almidt everything I loom for in music. I just wish i could have more access to underground tunes. But you can't really want more than that . it works wonders.
"I'm not a fan of the new UI. It really feels a little unnecessarily dumbed down. Otherwise, I absolutely love the service Spotify provides over other streaming services."
"works ok with Note 9 it has glitches and sometimes the songs can be skipped having the premium of course been waiting for a fix quite some time, the only fix is restarting the app sometimes."
"more like a 4.5 but would be on the minimum end of 4, has latest release except for some music like mixtapes like datpiff but has the more radio music hot mixes plus ultra extra. lets you save downlod to offline,. . . but only a limited amount so cuts down on playlist made and such. but with awesome internet and aweaome gb bout 1 gb you can play online recommend playlist that suits your music need or learn a new language, or maybe get into a serious talk on podcast. anyways ps4 has it. golden!"
"Makes one Fall in Love with Music again. Uninterrupted Music, Quality Sound, Beats all the Music Apps out there. UI/UX design original and very smooth to manoveur. Highly Recommend üëå. Would want to see some fitness app integration!"
There is a bug on the app making the music stop on its own after the latest update. the music stops and you need to reopen the screen for it to play. as well my lock screen spotify buttons do not work. please check this
Basically it is ok but there are 2 things thst i miss comparing to ios: 1. Searching song in playlist. We should be able to search it way easier as there is in ios (by scrolling up search bar is shown). In android version you have to tap that three dots and then go to find in playlist- too complicated! 2. When i want to remote music from my headphones i can only pause and play. Headphone button can not play next song by pressing button twice as it was on ios. Add this 2 features will be 5/5
this is a great app i became a member but since the first day of march theres been a problem where the music stop even tho its showing the option to stop the song plz fix this problem as soon as possible because its ruining the app and I know I'm not the only one experiencing this cuz I've seen alot of forums about this on Google plz fix!!
"The free version is a nuisance with all the ads. Premium is fairly affordable for what you get (offline mode, higher quality streaming, NO ADS, etc). The catalogue is also slightly limited in India - I noticed certain tracks grayed out when I switched locales from US to India. The free version could definitely do without annoying ads every few songs. It previously used to play them for a couple minutes every hour, why can't it just revert to that?"
"App could still be more responsive, and a lot more intuitive. However they have recently ironed out some really annoying bugs, for example I can now see my albums again! phew! Also the built-in wireless speaker / play through device support is beyond handy if you have a sonos system. I just wish when they absorbed groove they also kept the option to use the groove interface, as that app was visually 100x better."
"Only three stars not that i don't like the app, I love the tech and design. The four star rating is only because of the availability of music. Most of the Indian artists and some of the international labels are unable, which puts me off. Hope this scene changes, if it does will re-edit the review and give a Huge Thumps Up!"
"ads irritate a lot and user can't able to enjoy listening songs and it need to also add more songs which are quit popular. It just need to remove excessive ads, which seems important in this version, for making happy users."
Spotify is great overall but the new UI for the 'Now Playing' tab is rather ugly in my opinion. Now the text and symbols all have their size and even colour changed and it isn't too flattering. (for that I give 4 stars instead of 5)The previous design was slicker and fancier.
It's pretty good. Most tracks I've looked for I've found. Only really had trouble finding quite obscure music. Not perfect but pretty good.
"I've used the UK version of Spotify and it's the best music streaming experience out there no doubt. This Indian version has great potential... but there's loads of International songs missing, no family plan etc and that's a bummer. Hopefully Spotify gets their issues sorted out quickly so we can relish the full experience üî•üôèüèº."
"Losing that one star only because of songs that are not available in the Indian version. Amazing UI, amazing song recommendations. Everything is pretty dope. Loving it!"
Lost the heart symbol after upgrading to premium so can't like songs quockly to keep track of it. Is a pain in the ass to add to playlist. An easier playlist button which remembers the playlist you last added to like youtube would make everything so much easier. Anyway they have game ost's so that's awesome.
Still needs some polishing.. Like swiping animations and smooth ui.. But overall best music streaming app. This is the best.. Add some more features for music playing like adjusting your queue.
My only complaint is that Spotify India couldn't acquire all the licenses before their launch. A few artists and albums are missing. The experience is still great and this will turn into a 5 star rating after I can stream ALL the music I like.
"The service is really good. Seamless integration on separate devices. However, would like to have more Indian playback singers on the list. Its quite limited as of now."
"Take the trial then decide, but do take the premkum trial. I've been a spotify fanboy for years so might be a bit biased but the UI on this app has been far better than any other at the moment. That said, the music collection is still slightly limited. Hopefully it gets fixed soon."
"Spotify is Spotify - nearly every song I want to listen to available, easy to handle, etc. The fairly frequent layout/design changes can get a bit annoying though. And sometimes, out of the blue, the app has strange quirks (like stopping to play music with locked screen). Other than that - all good!"
"I got tuned in to Spotify by my daughter, and although I like a lot about it, I'm miss how Pandora makes suggestions of music based on my interests. I have to admit that building my own playlist is what brought me into the Spotify world."
"The service is great, but app is far from perfect. It often requires me to restart an app in order to control my playback from my mac. As said above: I would rate the service by 5, but not the app."
"This app is great! Unfortunately, after the latest update the pause button doesn't work every time. I'll have to poke it a couple of times before it'll pause, which is annoying when your toddler starts taking to you before you get it paused."
"Mostly everything one could wish for. Even a native desktop app for Linux. However, I would appreciate more customising options for organising the library, particularly tagging, collections and lists, possibility of adding playlists and podcasts to meta-playlists, and bookmarks or shortcuts in the library menu. In addition, the podcast section could be better arranged, not only into general categories."
"in india, the only issue is that the app doesn't have a repeat button for which a particular song can't be played in a loop. it's kind of shuffle play. and thats annoying. the only bug"
love spotify but I'm getting ticked off at the fact that I skip and the same song plays still so I press the skip button again and it skips twice I do not pay but please fix this it's been going on for a week and is very annoying. and yes I do wait and it's not lag
"Spotify is really dope! No doubt about it. I am still experimenting with other streaming services and trying to get a feel for what suits me and Spotify is right up there with the best of them. Just can't figure out how to que my podcasts in the order that suits my different tastes. Don't call me stupid just yet... I'm sure if there is a way then I will find it, given enough time."
"Your newest update isn't really working very well with me. The problem I'm having is that i just want to play ONE SONG but it now requires me to play and ENTIRE PLAYLIST to get to the song. If you were to downgrade it BACK to before this update, that would be great. -Ray"
"It's nice but sometime I don't enjoy it when I press the ""like"" button for the songs b/c it will play the same songs and will not generate different songs that are similar to the ones I ""liked""."
"Great app, great features, fairly intuitive. Missing some artists I'd like to have included, and higher sound quality would be nice. Overall well worth the money."
Nice and smooth. Student discount is a nice touch. Some tracks are missing which might be available on YT. Overall better UI than Apple Music.
"I like it so much, but I would really like you to improve a ""Sleep"" button, Google Music has it, I dont get why you don't, so I could listen to my music and fall asleep without having to wake up again to stop the music üòÇüòÇ"
"Please help, my offline songs keep getting unsaved when I phone restarts. I have to keep downloading them again every time. I own a Samsung S9 on Android 9 One UI"
when I travel overseas and occasionally in the USA I'm unable to play some of my music groups. I was told the maximum number of songs were 3333. therefore none of my songs should require redownloading because I am under that number.
UI & UX is good when we opt for Premium Version it gets bigger and so good to use. It's like a Netflix for Audio Streaming but tracks are not available give it soon.
"UI can be better, the app is a bit slow so needs to be corrected by making it more smooth. And the main thing it lacks a lot of songs.... like a lot and also the song updates a bit late in this where as other platforms have already had so this is quite disappointing."
"Great ""free"" platform to listen to music and build a comprehensive library in the process. The ads suck but it is free and easily rid of said ads by simply buying a subscription."
I love Spotify premium. i use it everyday and i am a very diverse listener so saying they have almost all the music i listen to is saying a lot and they even generate playlists of music that u like and frequent with music uve never heard or they hit u with a throwback youve forgotten about. and they tend to be more on point than other music apps ive had. only complaints i have are that they dont have Tool and they are missing quite a few underground colab songs that gey dropped but overall loveit
"Songs not available in my country is a bit of a bummer, they appear greyed out. Also, app should allow transferring downloaded songs to the SD card, as sizes can become extremely big and unbearable for internal memory. Overall, good selection of tracks, good quality, offline play is great, songs stream quickly so if you lose signal for a minute you're not bring interrupted."
I LOVE the app dearly but i HATE One thing the most!! THE ADS!! It pops up whenever you are listening to good music and chilling. The ads are so annoying and you can't even skip it. I throw my headphones whenever it pops up. Really Pissed up. For that I have deducted 1 Star. Please bring some change in ads like make it a musical melody or just give us the SKIP button. I'm sorry. I'm not up for Premium.
No doubt its best app but few issues are there. 1. Main song screen has resizing issue. not the main app screen but when on the Song Playing screen we transition it glitches and does resizing every single time. 2. If i pause the song for more than 30 seconds or something app gets killed. i can no longer play the song back using headset button or Samsung Gear Sport smartwatch. I have OnePlus 6T with the most recent software.
it doesn't feel like a proper version .. i saw a better spotify app in the us version.. need to improve the UI.. make it feel like us Spotify.. regards.
"been using mobile app, and desktop app for a year and half now. Mobile is reliable but still lacks the ability to edit playlist description, and photo, the ability to sort/organize all of your playlists is not possible on mobile. In overall the mobile app gives me the feeling of ""application abandonment"" by Spotify, as you need to have the desktop app to to access features that should be available on the mobile app, and after doing a couple quick searches apparently its been like ths 4a cple yrs"
Whenever I open my playlist I can't find my shuffle play button. There is a heart and a minus sign but no shuffle and repeat button. Please fix. Also i cant link spotify to Google assistant.
"In my opinion, spotify is the best choice for music streaming. period. The design is clean and the way it functions is very good. There are some downsides though to spotify. The app can be really glitchy at times and that could get a bit frustrating. Overall, its a good app and service (with premium because with free theres lots of restrictions)"
"Not bad overall. Good UI, good sound quality. As a free user, I sure don't mind ads, but on mobile version playing the desired songs should be an available function. Playlist problems: adding the new songs to the top of the playlist and set specific persons I want to collaborate on a playlist with are needed."
"I have been using Spotify since the servicd was in Beta and have never since then, not had a premium membership. It is a fantastic service. The app however does still require some fine tuning, not having features like searching in playlists, friends section to find their playlists or what theyre listening."
"It is really easy to use and have a good design. However, I still have to download songs all over again when I install this app from a new device or my premium runs out (I used giftcard once). Despite this problem, this is such a great music app and I suggest you to use this."
"I love Spotify, however I'm using a Huawei P9 lite and when i search for a band in my playlist e.g. The Wombats. I play one of their songs which is great but when the song ends, it should play the next wombat song. Although, it doesn't, I have tried messing around with the settings and buttons, had no luck. Any help would be appreciated"
Is there an option to remove the videos? its ruining my experience of this app. I just want the artwork not MTV. It also stops you from viewing and editing the queue. It's a really poor feature.
"the app briefly lost a critical piece of functionality, ruining the user experience for me. It has been restored, and once again Spotify is my running buddy. It still acts weird with play queues, but I can deal with that, since it's clear the service's focus is on playlists and radio stations."
"No problem for songs so far, but I found out that sometimes when I am trying to play a downloaded podcast episode, the episode fails to play. It is quite easy to take care of, just by erasing the episode, force stopping the app, then redownloading; but still it is annoying."
"Spotify is a classic, they've been in the game for years and played it well. for the most part I love the app, the ability to seamlessly switch between devices while continuing the same playlist is something I've used to great convenience and all the buttons are in places that logically make sense to me However, a recent update - involving moving gifs on songs - occasionally removes the only access button to the play queue during those songs with moving images, which is incredibly infuriating."
Good music app it is the best one out there. Some useless ads which are annoying but they're just a minor nuisance now and then.
I have found just about everything I want on here so far and i love the organization of it. The only reason its not 5 stars is because they have some kind of feature that keeps the music quieter when I Bluetooth to my car or head phones.
"App is fine, but it would be great to have a folder where you could access the music you've downloaded to your phone quickly without having to go through your playlists/albums!"
"Every 30min. or so they'll show a short commercial U have to get through,but to listen to almost anything anytime with only a cell is pretty cool. My data does seem to vanish pretty quickly though."
"love it. designs playlists based off what youve listened to, has almost all the stuff i listen to. the music is limited to mostly english music only. add music in other lsnguages (french, japanese, spanish, etc) ill rause my rating to 5 stars."
"the amount of adds is a piss off every 30 minutes so you only get about 3 or 4 songs inbetween adds and they go for quiet a while, and not being able to download the music unless u r a premium member is wrong. I was a premium member but I was being bill for 3 subs because i had it on 3 different devices and didn't realise for over 6 months so it was costing me close on $ 45 - a month. I was pissed off to say the least but was unable to contact spotify to inform them and possibly get premium memb"
"This is a great app. It works with your PS4 & puts mixes together based on what you listen to & like. My only complaint is they just simply don't have the amount of music that an app of this magnitude should have. There are quite a few songs I have tried to find such as Freddie Gibbs Sellin' Dope, (for example) that they just don't have."
"I've been using spotify for a while now and to be honest i really love it and been using it everyday.But there are still many problems,for example,i noticed Spotify drain my battery a lot even when it's offline,Spotify UI is amazing but i don't know why there are some features on the pc version is not available on mobile especially karaoke mode and i think the search bar in playlist should be always on and more importantly some classic songs that i search is not available."
"I'm a huge fan of this app, the only thing that keeps bothering me every single day is that some songs are way louder than others, they almost feel distorted (eg the whole Album Hot Fuss by the Killers). The ""Normalize Volume"" button in the settings does nothing about it unfortunately."
"great service, great app, very nice UI. but not without its problems. last versions have been causing huge battery drain on my phone. also, it got very slow. even on 4g connections. also, it makes you wait when you want to listen to downloaded music on slow connection while it's loading"
personally I love the app great selection and all however... I cant use my debit card to pay for premium and it's quite annoying. I'd love to get premium but dont have and dont want a credit card sooooo... yeah. again I'd love to get premium but I cant....
"As an avid music content consumer, I was almost immediately sold on the concept and have been a Premium customer for a number of years. A few UX suggestions: ‚Ä¢ Please look into the ability to remove a track from a playlist, while ON the track card. Currently have to either sieve thru the playlist, locate it, then remove; or use the search bar ‚Ä¢ Stop advertising new music on a pop up screen for artists (who are mainly irrelevant to my playlists) - I have Premium to avoid obnoxious popup Ads"
"intuitive and simple application. however there are a number of gaps. for example, I am unable to add podcast to a playlist"
"spotify has a 50% off for students that go to university which is great but what about highschool? highschool is one of the most stressful things, and the worst thing happening is that its finals week and your parents wont pay $10 for premium!! bit frustrating? sure university/college students need to pay for taxes and mortage. but maybe highschool should be saving up for future school tuition NOT $10 for premium. thanks premium please update"
"When I tried to play music in Samsung Music on Spotify tab, it opens Spotify apps instead of playing directly in Samsung Music. I love both Spotify great song recommendation and Samsung Music great UI plus edge lighting so true Spotify integration would be great even if it were limited to premium users because I'm a premium user myself. As a premium user, ads are of no concern so true integration without redirection to Spotify wouldn't hurt right?"
"i review spotify with 4 Stars because I face a unsolvable problem with equalizer. If someone have faced the same problem and and solved it,please read below and help me .When i use the application from my car's source the volume is really low , while coincidentally , when i change to FM , without any change to the options of equalizer, the volume is higher about 40%. The same problem appears also while i connect AUX. I tried to change the loudness from interior menu of spotify without any result."
"The app is okay, "" upgrading to premium for seamless streaming of my favorite songs and artists.. I can get with that!"". My only issue is when i stream my spotify to a gaming console Via wifi; It seems to cut out or fade when the bass plays in most songs. 4/5 stars seems a little gratuitus."
I highly recommend spotify to anyone trying to find a music app. Free to listen to songs. One suggestion though. Having a play button as well as the shuffle would be nice. I know this is possible with spotify premium but making this a possibility without spotify premium is one of my top suggestions. Great app!
I used Deezer for about 6 months before this. Spotify has better playlists but there are things that the Deezer app did better than the Spotify app. I quite like the feature of being able to pause and play from a different device over the internet (even if I never use it).
"Annoying that you have to pay for it, but I guess all good things must be earned! Regardless, quite compact to store and carry my music wherever I travel."
it's great I have premium so I get offline music which is great for snowboarding but the only con I have is the sort button they need to bring it back instead of going through a menu.
"The interface is a bit clumsy on the app (compared to the desktop version). Searching by criteria (geography, genre etc.) is a bit difficult. Integration with other devices is often unintuitive. I do enjoy the recommendations."
its a good app with premium but wothout premium there are songs you cant listen to and quite a few adds but other then that it is a solid app but if your not looking to spend money go to soundcloud there are less ads.
anniversary 1 yr premium. much love üòç spotify. found a lot of joy in music in 2018 with you. suggested enhancement : visualization for casting to television. ( love the mobile enhancement with visuals on select songs.) main suggestion... improve UI for edit of Playlist on mobile. not easy to search track in Playlist or remove or move. yuck. must fix.
excellent app and library. needs more equalizer options that are quickly accessible. shouldn't need to dig through several menus to access it. otherwise app works perfectly
"I had android and Apple and I can say the Apple one is way smoother then the android one and it doesn't make sense why there not the same.the android on you have to always go to the top and press the menu button and press find in playlist if you want to find a song where as Apple you just swipe up and boom the search bar is there, kindof feels like there holding out on android.. Just my 2 cents still a solid platform for music one of the best of not the best but they held out on Android"
"The best user experience music app out there, But without hi res sound can't compete with the rest. Waiting for this to happen asap!!!!!!!!"
"Using the app for almost 2 years. Overall good user experience. Only came across one minor glitch, which was fixed. There is some music from certain artists unavilable on Spotify."
"very good, but the ads need to be toned down a bit, playing two 30 second ads (sometimes up to 4) back to back really ruins the experience"
One of the better music streaming apps. I enjoy how seemless it works cross-device (ie. playing a song on your computer from where it left off on your phone) and the auto-playlists are quite on point. My only gripe is the lack of Widgetry - refer to Black Player for a how to on that front.
Love spotify but i hope one day they will add an alarm button so u pick a song and the time wait for the current time and boom the song u chose will ring bc some people find it hard downloading songs for ringtones on their phone so to me the alarm button would be helpful.üëçüëç
its great but i dont undsrstand why it skips through the song when i tap the power button.... this just started about 2 weeks ago and i dont know how to fix it. i will rate 5 stars for fix in next update
"Artist deep dive during sign up is extremely interesting and found some real gems that hard to find and even harder to remember, but when you see them it's like meeting an old friend again. Wish the mood selections were built more like theme genres then emotional moods (montage theme for desk job vs happy at work). Decent derivative shuffle so songs do stay in same vein well together. Wish it co-existed or paired it's strengths with Google Music because they both do good in the others weakness"
"UI is mostly great, I only get confused where to find stuff every once in a while. The download to device premium feature has been amazing and is the reason I purchased it."
"It's a nice app for you to listen to music on, but I can only shuffle play when I'm on my phone, which can get in the way. I may be missing a setting but I think the original setting should have it to play in order first. If I'm listening to songs that require to listen in order to get what it means (like musicals) I can't listen to them in order, which gets in the way sometimes, but some songs I just like to listen to in order if they're from a video game that I like."
Great UX! Just really wish there were an option to use the 15 sec forward and backward while listening to music (this can be done when listening to podcasts in this app)
"Great app and can mostly find the music I'm looking for but my only problem is that when you're listening to a song in the ""All Songs"" part of Your Library there should be a button to press that takes you straight to the song in that playlist that you were last listening to when you closed the app or you just get taken straight back to that spot in the playlists once opening said playlist"
"i love this app! if you dont wnat to pay for premium, you can get the app on your labtop and skip, go back a song, and pick the song you want. you can do almost everything that has premmuim on you computer, ezcept to doen lode stuff/songs and you do have to lissen to some ads"
It was a great app until they got rid of the search bar at the top of your own playlist and instead replace it with a 'Find in playlist' option in the menu bar! Also the scroll button being at the very top of the playlist is null as it always open the menu unless you scroll down a little! Annoying!
"Basically happy with it, but there's always room for improvement. Like building a true Randomizer for shuffled play. Too often you hear the same songs..."
"For some reason the song listed on my notification bar isn't the song that's actually playing, and this is an issue that's been happening for quite a few days now. Other than that, the app's great."
"exquisite. Weekly and daily, different songs in recommended playlists. It's good, for people listens to other songs that isnt trending, it's like-new,even if its already out in the market LoLz..PeAcE!"
"Good app. Only problem (yes I have pressed the shuffle button) my playlist is not shuffling, it is so frustrating. I press shuffle play, does not shuffle either."
"Great app, such a nice and easy way to get to all your favourite artists. There are some features that might be better though, it is quite difficult to make playlists. It would be nice if you could turn your queue into a play list"
Excellent app but PLEASE dont erase the quick option to search songs inside playlist. Now you have to follow three steps to search a song. Two weaks ago you had the option of searching above your playlist.
"I love this app. However, when given to get 30 minutes of ad free listening for one ad, hit ""No thanks."" Apparently 30 minutes is equivalent to two songs."
"I love Sporify, but the app is not intuitive for me to use it. Also ot has problems with connectivity, often shows that it is offline, but the internet is on."
"Why it's really often that the song stopped about 1 or 2 second before the song completed and then the song wont next unless we press the next button by outself? It reduces the chance we can skip 6 song in one hour, please fix"
"Suggestion: You should add a Download button for a single song, instead of saving the whole playlist or album for offline streaming just to acquire that specific song."
Its a really good app just make it more clear hoe to download individual songs and not the entire album lake place a small tick next to the song to download rather then a save button hidden away
"I like the app quite a bit but the whole paying for premium to get skips is kinda stupid, and the adds like boi chill with the adds. But if you do pay for premium it's a good decision."
"Well designed, get what you pay for with a solid catalogue and good playlists and radios. Well-designed options and settings, and the 'very high' quality is decent. Would get 5 stars if would offer access to at least some live concerts at least by major artists - TIDAL are much better in this area. Thus, I like this app!"
"Good app with lots of musix variety, but please fix the randomise feature! It never gets through an entire playlist without recycling the same songs mutiple times. Atleast add an option to manually slide songs up and down your own created playlist, or a button that randomises the full playlist so you can then listen through chronologically, ensuring you hear all your songs. When I'm paying for the full version, these request really should be standard"
"Good but missing quite a few famous, well known songs which I'm surprised about as there are kareoke versions of the songs on spotify. Could certainly be improved."
"Nice app and easy to use! The ads are understandable for the free version, but the only suggestion is to make them more suitable for the type of playlist people are listening to. I was listening to a ""sleep/relaxing"" playlist and got really annoyed by a noisy and loud ad."
"Spotify is a quick and easy way listen to music for FREE. However, ads can pop up, but not very often. Definitely a good place for music!"
"I love this app but the new ui makes it harder to find new music! I understand the drive to simplify everything in modern software, however you've just limited the app. All I can do now is scroll through genres or use the browse tab to find fresh beats. Besides that, great app. I use it on the daily"
UI needs work. Distinguishing between downloaded and non-downloaded songs / playlists still isn't as easy as it should be.
"I really like Spotify but after a few last updates ""now playing"" notification doesn't work at all. Maybe it's caused by 8.1 android but hey, please fix it. It's annoying when I have every time when I need to pause or play music go into the app, Bluetooth headphones buttons doesn't do anything....in previous versions it worked well."
Free is for me. Ads a bit annoying though pruce is right (free). I will stop listening immediately if charges are ever required. Diverse music and wide variety.
Pretty good. I switched from Apple Music. I think the selection of playlists is one of the strong points. I also like how podcasts are built in.
Just difficult to change albums when teaching aqua aerobics!! I'd like to have button to tell me how to do these things!! a helpful hints area
"I side it all the time, and I love it. But I really wish it had a built in sleep timer like Pandora and Audible and other streaming apps. I'd give 5 stars if they added it. But we've been asking for it for years, to no avail."
"It's great at suggesting songs! You don't get unlimited skips with the free account, but i haven't even cared lol. Would give it 5 stars if 1) you could access settings from any screen, and then return to that screen with a tap of the back button. Currently you have to go to the home screen, then re-navigate back; 2) if you guys had gift cards!! Like Google Play; some of us don't use credit cards OR PayPal. If you guys had retail gift cards, i would absolutely switch to Premium, and make it my primary service over Google Play. Other than that, excellent app"
"Nice. Works well. Although I have found that many artists complete works are not available. Found more on old MS Groove. Plus user interface needs some work, clean up, simplify, make navigation more intuitive, and add more artist background info."
"How a company deals with problems is a good reflection of how good the company is. The 8.4.75 update that was rolled out mid October made the app unusable on my Galaxy s8 with constant app crashes. I contacted them and was pleasantly surprised in how quick and responsive they were, e-mailing me back and providing feedback on how the fix was progressing. Once the 8.4.77 update, which solved the issue, was released I was offered a refund on my last month's subscription. Well done Spotify. You made an error but how you dealt with it more than made up for what happened."
"This app is great for listening to music and making playlists. However, I wish that phone app's podcast features worked better. I wish for: automatically downloading X# of episodes (on/off wifi only) ""mark played/unplayed"" button, and retention of the ""sort by"" and ""show only unplayed""."
"Love Spotify, best decision I ever made when going premium. However, there are quite a few songs/bands I like that aren't on Spotify, I don't know why that is, but I've no clue how to do anything about it, if possible at all."
"I have enjoyed this app a lot through the years. Though what has happened to the ""browse and radio"" buttons on there. Its confusing and less ease of use"
"The music selection is good but not as full on some areas as Google Play or Bandcamp for more independent artists. Overall it is a great player though, nice streamlined UI and quick to use"
"App is slightly glitchy. Sometimes says it's in offline mode and I can't search, but it isn't and I just deleted the app and redownload it. Happens quiet frequently on my Google pixel."
"I like this app but feel ¬£9.99 is a little too much to pay for Premium. I recently had a problem with my account & the customer service was excellent, the problem was sorted out very quickly"
"I love Spotify but please, when I click 'no thanks' on an ad - don't make me watch 2 full length ads. Seems a bit counter intuitive to say the least."
"Spotify is my favorite music streaming app. It has some falses such as very limited downloads (trough having premium, which is definitely worth it), it doesn't support Siri, Google Assistant... Spotify is slowly improving user experience and over app functionality. I think/hope many today's issues will be resolved in the future."
They told me they would never try to charge me for use of this app then told me I had to uninstall it from my device after they tryed to charge me. But that was when I was in Alaska. We shall see how it works in Louisiana. Great selection of music. If you can remember the name of the songs your in luck. That or they start you out on someone else play list.
"Now I can listen to great songs while pooping, and I do mean it. I normally poop for a long time because of, I don't know because I'm not a doctor. I should have become a doctor if I study a bit hard, but everytime I got anxiety, I wanted to poops. You know how anxiety you'll get when you see blood. I can't even stand blood from a mosquito bite. And living in warm tropical country doesn't help much because there are alot of mosquito here. The warm weather made it hard for me to sleep at night, so I listen to Spotify then also..."
"It's quite difficult to get premium by using the app, I'm sure it's a bug on the app since my connection are fast enough. Other than that it's very good"
I prefer the ads over the inability to skip more than 5 songs on free version but I guess with premium you don't have either problem overall it is good to listen to music on I also quite like the podcasts
"Could use a few more features like easier ways to get to artists without having to click through so many menus, and new filtering options. Something more modular would work better I think because it's a very text heavy UI, but overall it works good and there is huge selection"
It is a very intuitive program. I do wish it was better for android users to create playlists and edit the sequence of songs in the playlist. I also wish it was easier to save a song you like. Maybe just adding a check mark next to the title instead of the three dots to the menu each time. But I like it . I am discovering lots of new music. Thank you!
Great way to listen to music. Either build your own playlists or have them recommend music based on the bands and genres you like.
"For the most part, I like this app quite a bit. I signed on when it first opened years ago. I only have one big complaint: Maybe this has been fixed recently, but a couple years ago when Spotify got hacked, my account was destroyed & I could not get anyone to help me for weeks because I couldn't find out how. Eventually I lucked out & found out a place to email people and they did eventually help me. But my advice is, they need a customer service email and it needs to be common knowledge."
awesome app! would have liked it more if it was easier to add songs to your library or playlist with the click of a button. Because its a process now and i just dont have the time to sort 2k songs into a playlist by tap holding selecting etc.
"I use alot of music streaming apps, but i like this one because i like Mexican regional music and Spotify since its the more mainstream one gets them way before anyother app. I also quite enjoy the ps link it has, i can change my tone in gaming without leaving the game screen"
"The app is great. Has quite a complete music list. Very enjoyable to be your running buddy. Great sound. Great vibe. But, sometimes you need to manually shuffle the music even though you have put it on shuffle. Maybe because I haven't gone for a premium account. I am not sure. Overall, it is a great app!"
I love spotify but I often get quality drops that ruin the music session. Like the music is suddenly off key and sounds like there's an underwater type of effect. I thought it was my mobile network but It also happens when I listen on PC or tablet. Wonderful appoutside of that.
"It's good, some of the settings are not as intuitive as I'd like since I prefer not to stream constantly. I'd like easier ways to select downloaded songs and create playlists"
"If they could get a built in equalizer tied specific to the app, it'd be perfect. I know license issues are a another story but, premium handles that perfectly"
Please do add some of the new features like a timer that we want to stop the music without play/pause the button and reminders to play by itself with selected times that we want. That'll be perfect!
"Im a constant Spotify user for quite some time already. But until today, theres always an error where Spotify wont detect my internet connection. I always had to force close my app and reopen it in order to temporary fix it. Spotify, please help me!"
Great selection with lots of hard to find artists. Easy to sort types and likes of music. Find myself building and listening to playlists more than I thought I would.
Wide range of music that doesn't have many ads that ruin your music time so you can listen to music without the premium service.
"I like this app, but I really wish there was a ""song preview"" button that could be pressed and play the main chorus of the song. That is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5."
"Good app, but pauses for no reason sometimes. Not sure that I'd call it a crash, but I can't continue playing music again but pressing the play button on my headphones, have to open the app and press play. That's my only complaint."
"It's great, we pay for the premium version with no ads which is worth it in my opinion! Sometimes the ""shuffling"" doesn't quite shuffle properly but not too bad. I like browsing through the alley created playlists - found some great music that way!"
I bought the premium and for some reason my music will just stop. Never paused it or hit any button's but it will just stop randomly. Dont like that after I paid for music to not stop. Other then that good app and has all my songs
"It's a great app because you can listen to any music for free, but it requires data. However, if you're looking to play a specific song in Mobile, this isn't the best all unless your wanna pay $10/month on Premium."
"I want to download some playlists using my data but when I go to settings and try tapping the button to change it so I can download using my data nothing happens.. and yes my data works.. when I tap the button it remains grey like its disabled, it doesn't switch to green like when I tap other options... there is nothing I can find for support in the app for this matter.. I will change my review if fixed because this is a very good app otherwise."
"Would like to be able to play songs in order rather than being forced into shuffle mode. Otherwise, the app is good. Not too many audio ads (the pop-up ads are a little intrusive, though), and a fairly intuitive interface."
Wish it would quit stopping out of no where. Stops playing at random times. And its not just me or my phone. Happens on all of my devices and my friends all experience the same problem. Other then that I enjoy the app
"Over all I love Spotify. The only gripe is the search function which after several searches stops working, requiring you to close and reopen the app which is annoying"
Some random but semi frequent bugs such as songs randomly stopping (requiring an app restart to fix) stop me from giving five stars. Premium is great value for money.
"It's a good music app but it has a lot of ads though it has is 30 minute ad free thing but you have to have 2, 5 second ads and a 10 to 15 second ad and you have to stop your music and you have to reactivate it to get that luxury"
"The interface is pretty bad but usable. The redeeming factor is it works quite well with Google Assistant devices (Google Home, Chromecast, etc.) But this app is pretty bad and not as good as the iOS one. Marking playlists and queues is a pretty big pain that can be undone by an accidental key press (in comparison to Google Play Music)."
"Good performance paired with tricky, hard-to-find, and ever-changing settings. Offline mode surprisingly hard to use. Squirrelly music quality settings."
"Generally good, sometimes gets confused about whether it's online or not, and even worse sometimes forgets what it has downloaded, requiring a reinstall and redownload."
Overall been great. Wish UI worked as well on adroid as it does on Apple. Adding things to que and removing songs from playlist bit more time consuming.
"As with any software there are a few bugs and probably some compatibility issues with certain devices. For example, I be had a few issues with the App's quick menu not functioning properly or at all, but other than that it's a pretty great service."
"Good app, high selection for free, disappointed at the limited capacity to make and enjoy playlists on the free version, but aside from that I'm quite satisfied."
Could be a 5 star rating but you keep changing functions that were good and mess upp quite often with the codeing for communication between devices. Put som more love and recognition at the people who build this platform.
"Perfect app for building playlist, and storing them without using space on your device. Great selection of any genre of music you want and could possibly think of!"
"Little issue with certain buttons not having prompts or the ability to undo, so if you click something, you'd better mean it, but otherwise does everything I was expecting and then some."
"Very good, easy to use... has a good mixes of songs that were built by fans. The only disadvantage that i found was the absence of the songs lyrics"
"Honestly, I find a lot more indie bands and musicians on here than anything. All the big names dislike their pay model, but unknowns get way more exposure than they would w/o it. Listen to artists you don't know then hit the radio button for more."
I love this app but the only thing is that sometimes it crashes and I have to uninstall the app then reinstall. It also won't let me share any music when I click the share button.
"It has improved a lot through the years but could still use a few more features. For example, there's no button to clear the song queue instantly."
Hate the 6 skips per hour system. Also random songs in an album is annoying. And if you skip you can't even find your own song in your designated album and waste all 6 skips.
"Great music selection! Can even find a tonne of not so well known international artists! And discover weekly can have some really good suggestions. However, the app istelf isn't the best it can be yet imo. It has little quirks here and there that can be a bit annoying."
"I like this app compared to most other apps I have used, but the adds and amount is not suitable for my taste, it says 30 minutes of ad free music, then you get an ad after two songs"
"The app seems to have been less well than usual after the updates. My playlist takes a while to load songs (downloaded playlist), and doesn't load all of the playlist. Sometimes the forward button doesn't work so you have to pause the song for a few seconds"
"I love this ap but I think the layout/navigation need updating. When I hit my ""back"" button, it doesn't continuously go back to the last page. After 2 back clicks you end up on the home page of your phone. Annoying!!"
It's Spotify. The app has been quite glitchy recently songs just seem to pause themselves and when trying to play songs on Bluetooth it sometimes goes off on its own tangent.
"I have been using Spotify for 2 - 3 years now and I like. these day there seem to be so many bugs when using the interface, sometime Spotify refuse to close when you exit the app and more. I hope it get fixed. Except these bugs, it's quite good."
Lately I have not been able to search and download new music not sure if they have over expanded themselves and have not built enough data centers to handle the traffic.
"Amazing capabilities, certain UX things just don't make sense and can be a little confusing at times. Still the best app out for this type of listening by a good bit"
"Really liking it, but it's hard to figure out how to do simple things like clearing my queue etc. It can definitely be more intuitive."
"Great app, apart from a few glitches, like the notification song play button not working properly sometimes, and the songs name not tracking to the current song"
"It's quite a good app free, or with premium. However I wish you could access songs you pressed dislike on to undo it. I have heard its quite a common issue"
It's a good app you can't use it as well if you don't have the latest version and can't download music if you have premium on a older version I actually had quite a bit of trouble today to the point I've had to delete and reinstall the app. In general the app is ok but if you have premium it's good.
"Great music app. However, in recent releases it randomly stops playing either between or in the middle of a song requiring you to have to unlock your phone and restart the music."
"I've had this problem, and I know my sister has also had this problem. Music will be playing and all if a sudden it will pause. You have to press the play button again for it to play again. It would play for a few seconds and then it would pause. We love Spotify, but we don't know why this is happening to us."
I've noticed that the music I like which is loud music is making itself go quite with each update to the app can you make the app have an opinion to make the music loud btw I listen to my music at full volume.
"Good, except for one issue. The app is very quiet. Soundcloud, in comparison, is much louder and does not require me to turn the volume to almost max."
Great service but this app is kinda bad. All kinds of annoying UI issues that really take away from the enjoyment. Using for over a year and it never gets better.
"I just wish the payment and family sharing methods were less confusing. My family couldn't get it to work, and when I wanted to upgrade to premium for myself after unsubscribing previously, there was no button for a single account. That is to say that I had only the option to pay the family price."
