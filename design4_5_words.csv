review_description
"Generally a good service, but! I'm a traveler and digital nomad so I change my location quite often and in order to continue using Spotify I have to change my country in the settings if my account. Can't we make it automatically? It's quite outdated to bind people to an adress. While I can understand that there might be payment/currency issues, but even on the free version it's happening as well."
I dont pay for many services but Spotify Premium is worth it to me. Ive been able to rediscover music I had forgotten about and can always find a playlist to suit my mood.
"My style of music, I get what I'm looking for and quickly"
Amazing user experience with plenty of options on music/podcasts
"Yeah what is to add, best app to listen to music. Premium users on family plan, which is quite reasonably priced. Appreciate the music quality options for download/streaming."
"Didn't realize how amazing Spotify is until I used Amazon Music (free trial). This app is far, far superior to Amazon Music. Very intuitive, quick, and does exactly what you want it to."
"Most bugs and requests I have reported to Spotify have been fixed and developed. This is how developers should react to feedback. One bug though remains: A downloading notification for Spotify playlists, remains (when playlist is automatically renewed) even if the download is over and the only way to get rid of it is to tap on it thus opening the app. Then it immediately goes away. Ps. How about a new UI theme choice? :!-)"
"There are other apps too stop pretending like you're the only one out there spotify. Even if that doesn't work I can just pirate music. Other than you insisting that ""you shall bear with the ads or perish"" your service is actually pretty good, both sound quality and ui wise very pog."
"I love this app. I love how it chooses just the right song based on my activy, unlike with other apps that chooses a way different genre of a song I'm playing which sucks. But I hope there could be a button or a feature wherein we don't have to swipe up for the lyrics every single time, just something that would show the lyrics automatically for all songs we're playing. If you get the idea? I'll be looking forward for it."
There should be an option to download individual songs. Could also use an even a quicker way of adding a song to a playlist.
unpopular opinion but i actually like the newer player ui. nicely done spotify team. Try to make it a little less cluttered and your app will be even better
"5 stars, the only thing that annoys me is when you accidentally click the like button on an old song that you liked, so you remove it from liked songs and you can't undo it. If it at least wasn't right next to play/pause button..."
"so many bugs! remote playing basically does not work at all, the UI does often not respond and random playing does not work."
Recommendations are so damn Perfect. Interface is quite good and with the green and black theme it feels sick !
"I have been using Spotify for my family and I since 2015. And I never intend to stop. It is my most used app on my phone. I love having Premium. It is definitely worth the money, everything about Spotify is amazing, and I've already managed to convert quite a few people. Keep up the incredible work. The pre-made Playlists are great for indecisive people such as myself, that only know the mood they're in, and Spotify does all the rest!! They literally have everything you could ask for, and more!"
"Hello, Spotify team, Gives a clear button for recent played Because person to person they changes their mind for listening songs and that's annoying for hearing same songs in different mood or mindset of same person. So pleased, suggest this upgrade to your team leader, Thank you."
"I take this app for granted! Thank you Spotify for making a good app. After using the disgusting app of YouTube Music, I appreciate Spotify so much more! Great UI, good functionality, awesome features! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Spotify something is wrong with my liked songs when I click on the button it shows a blank space
"Good app, love the experience. One small bug I found: During a Remote Group Session, only Iphone users can see the song queue. For android users the button is greyed out. Would love to see this fixed."
I have enjoyed the ease of using the app. It's so easy to build a playlist. I have recommended the app to others and will continue to do so.
"I've had a couple problems with spotify over the years, but nothing major. Recently my Facebook got hacked which is how I log in and I could no longer access my spotify account. Their customer service had me all fixed up in less than 10 minuits through a text service. I was amazed."
It's a really great company. And I have a wide variety of music. I get the gift cards every so often so I don't have to pay a prescription. I really like that option. And also has good sound quality. The only thing I wish they had was a down button like some other competitors but other than that it's a great app. And great customer service I had a problem once and they fixed it within minutes. And we're very professional and polite. Keep up the good work Spotify
Learned my likes quickly! App is easy to setup and use. It's also exposed me to great artist I didn't know.
Latest update made some of my playlists on mobile inaccessible waiting on a fix I need pc just to press play button
"Probably the best music streaming platform...high quality music and very classy ui I love everything about Spotify And yes, the premium plan is very affordable and worth the money."
"Outstanding platform for listening songs , Spotify is the best app than any other ü§©üíï, love its features and UI very much. Very user-friendly (except those unwanted and daily same recommendations üòí) but like this platform should be listening our favourite songs as well as new songs."
Good ui interface
"It's great love this app, I wish a lot of songs were on here. Songs that are from SoundCloud and etc. One problem is when I skip through multiple songs quickly sometimes it'll freeze and etc"
"Awesome platform, but, with all the ads (5 30sec ads at times) and still not being able to listen songs in order sux, even ruin listening to a single artist when the shuffle jumps to other artists you don't want"
"Now that the loading issues are fixed, app is great and even the free version is quite nice(granted you use the browser/desktop versions to create playlists)."
"Efficient, effective honestly one of the best apps I have ever used. The algorithm is spectacular always finds what I want. If you are looking for an app to use to find specific songs you don't know: Spotify is great for that or Shazam. 9/10 still needs ux upgrades and more control."
Good app with a lot of music to suit different music taste.
IOS app UI is better... please make it like that _ atleast add the swipe controls
Its been great as a deaf person i use special equipment to hear my favorite songs the ones i missed when i was a teenager. So thanks for the anxiety relief.
it getsmy style of music quick and authors that i forgot about
I love my Spotify. I love music from classical for Bubble baths ! I listen to Liberace to Rock and Roll for bangin' your head ! Thanks Quiet Riot !!! There's music for every mood ! For everyone ! It's just to bad premium isn't free. I listen to music instead of watching TV. Why watch other people doing something and getting nothing done when I could be doing something myself.
"Let it be the quality of songs, the suggestions or the usability of the UI, all the features are very attractive and lovable. Could have had more collection of old Telugu songs."
Amazing It's a quick and wonderful app . Works in a few seconds to find the sing I'm looking for it's just great
"I love Spotify. I can start with a old favourite like Zep, Floyd, CCR and Spotify gives great recommendations for other artists I might like. From that new artist I get further recommendations and so on. Its grown my listening habits considerably. As for Podcasts, last year I didn't bother with them. Now I have quite a few on the go. Great sport pods and my new favourite The Rockonteurs. With Gary Kemp and Guy Pratt."
Excellent app. I am able to listen all my old songs. I can add songs from one album to another album very easily. Not giving 5 star rating because I can't add few songs in my album all together. That one improvement is required.
Brilliant. Love this app so much. This is all I need to access the songs I ‚ù§ and its all I listen to. I no longer play cds as I have everything at a touch of a button here. Best thing ever.
"It gets the job done. I can listen to my own, familiar music, or search a radio according to how I feel. Family plan works for everyone and the offline listening when there's no internet connection is fantastic for those power outage times. Gives me something to kick back to as long as I've thought ahead to download some stuff. UI can be better, but it's not the worst I've used either."
"This app works really well, would like the non-premium to have more skips though. Otherwise great all round app. Awesome for listening to good playlists and sharing music with friends. Very simple UX and UI which i really appreciate."
Everything works well. UI is intuitive.
"Really what to say other than I've been using Spotify in a major way for the last few years and the experience is pure pleasure for the ears. I prefer having premium, but I have had to go back to the free version multiple times for financial reasons and I still keep my library and have access to all my songs while online which is great. I can even continue building my library for free. This one's a keeper üòÄ"
A reliable app for music of general kinds. Quite reliable and dependable for musical entertainment.
I really enjoy Spotify easy to use affordable easy and quick browse any music of your choice bigup Spotify
"I enjoy Spotify and without it my life would be quite different, however it doesn't have some old or social media songs"
I always find what I'm looking fit to suit my mood.
"Excellent music app. I've been using Spotify for years now and it's really revolutionized the way I listen to and find music, the value for money is phenomenal when compared to buying individual albums, although I do hope the artists get a fair share of the monthly subscription. Most of the time the app works really well but sometimes it does have some issues with queuing & saving songs, etc. Also being able to que songs on Samsung galaxy watch would be awesome. Thanks for the great app Spotify."
Awesome. The best of all music apps out there. Love the data analytics used and the user experience.
"Spotify is the best music streaming service I have used so far. I hold a student account and it gives me the ability to have Premium at a cheaper price. However, if you are not a university student, Premium is quite expensive... Spotify free is quite good when using a laptop (can select songs, unlimited skips), but is very basic for mobile user (playlist order is random, only significant amount of skips per hour, you cannot download, and more). Spotify is VERY basic if you do not have premium..."
The thing I love the most is the discoverability and versatilities of genres. And definitely the overall UI and the always dark theme.
Please change back the play button to where it was! ‚èÆ‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚è≠ The new design (‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚èÆ‚è≠) is neither practical nor aesthetically pleasing. Update: it's back to normal :D
I love this app and have been using it for quite a bit now. It's a cool app and is cool how you can listen to your favorite music for free. I really recommend getting Spotify.
"When it has to load (which is a moderate amount) it takes a while, or it just stops and you have to press the play button on whatever your listening to (exept for podcasts). Also usually when it plays an ad that should give you ""thirty minutes of ad free music"" it just plays a song or two then gives you more ads. (Free user pov) Edit: i now have premium and 4 the past few months its been where it just stops in the middle if the song and then just starts up again or it takes like 10 min to load:("
Amazing for streaming music reccomend you buy premuim for the ads to go away
Guys there is many bugs in miui version plz fix itüò£ because I use Spotify everytime I can't live without music üòçplz fix the bugs üò•
"I am enjoying the music on spotify it is wonderful to have a whole new music experience, more wider variety of song request which is absolutely brilliant. I really like spotify and i wouldn't like to be without it. You deserve five stars from me because you are brilliant. Keep the good music coming, and thank you so much. I am having issues using the back button to play the same song again especially if i like it. The forward arrow is lit up but the back arrow is not which is quite frustrating."
I love Spotify. So much. I pay for premium and recently for the past few weeks Spotify was not working. At all. The app wouldn't even open. I emailed Spotify and they emailed me back very quickly and worked with me to get everything working. I did have to email twice to get it to work but it's fine. It's working now and I am so happy! Thank you Spotify!
"I like this app very much. There are quite a lot of adds but still, their music is the best. Love it so much."
Spotify is great would be 5 starts if the enhance button didn't appear and then disappear
"It's a great app, but ive just found a little bug on my Redmi 7 at least. So, when i try to put a song from the beggining using the minute/second bar, it just gets stuck on a certain minute/second but the song keeps playing on the background, idk why, but then it gets fixed by using the button of restart song. Id give 5 stars tbh."
"Believe me.Spotify is the best. The best of spotify is It's sound.Literally no any audio app can beat spotify in audio quality.In ""Very High"" or in ""High"" it's sounds are heaven! And the second best thing is: It's UI. This is one of the best. Literally the UI is so user friendly.and here comes the looks of the UI.It's too good and looking great in a simple look,with no hazardous thing in the UI. And the another one is: It makes a playlist or remix type based on your played list.This is good."
"I love the Spotify app, Ive been a premium user for years. I would LOVE to see a feature added where if you have a playlist/album downloaded thru premium, that it would default to playing the downloaded version rather than using data. When my cell service is spotty, my music wont load. When I toggle airplane mode quick, it loads instantly. Can this be fixed? Thanks!"
Overall great! Downloaded music stops at random and will not start to play again until 'play' button is pressed.
It lacked count-down timer for shutdown. A key feature required at bed time. Thank you Spotify for adding the function.
"Somewhat better now, the ads have lessened to some degree afaik, and the songs that I'd otherwise not want to listen to are actually quite good in terms of the overall selection of songs. The audio quality and other existing elements within the app are definitely still the same (or I've never paid much attention to them), and currently I don't have much issues with Spotify as a music platform. üëè"
I've only started used this app.along with my new phone and I'm finding the music available quite good thank you
I'm giving you guys 5 stars for not cancelling Joe Rogan. And also because your streaming service is quite good üòÖ
"Great app. Also love the fact that one can listen to any song for free if one isn't ready to upgrade. And the app does well to recommend daily mix and albums that are more personalized for the user. And by the way, the UI is great. Keep improving."
Great... fantastic...SPOTIFY was designed especially for me (With me in mind). Thank you.
"I really love the app, i get to explore more music and quite a number of podcast without any hinderance"
They ruined the app you can't play the song you want to play because it's randomized and you can't play songs on repeat anymore dont download they wants your money(edit) never mind you just can't be poor I bought premium worth it
"Brilliant thanks, I love using Spotify. It is so easy to use and adapt quickly to my laptop, mobile phone and Fitbit watch. My music everywhere with me. Peace and love"
Bad update. The play / pause button is not available you can't stop podcasts you just have to play another one or put your phone on silent. Pretty much made it un usable.
"very quick on search and low data usage .. ,üëç"
"Pleasing UI and mainstream catalogue, but need more video game ost catalogue and hifi option"
Amazing versatile app. Totally suits my needs for my work as breathwork Facilitator and for my personal use.
"Love Spotify, easy access to all my favourite artists at the click of a button."
Queue button is blurred out. Why?
Pause button works again as of today! Happy with the app again.
"It works, seamless, pick a song or build a playlist, change it up."
I love it I play alot on it but I wish that if you don't buy permeuim it doesnt let u go hack one song and it only plays the songs u want in Playlist so uh yea it rlly is good but I think it needs a Lil more work/improvement
"Quite musical EDIT: Could you put the update log on the playstore, I'd like to know what I'm updating"
"I'd say it's a good app My 2 issues with it is in the library section it doesn't stay on downloaded button. It is lost when you exit app would be cool to have a leave where you left off setting. Other issue is if im watching shorts with no sound it now fades away. I didn't turn Spotify off. Understandable when I click on a whole video, but not for the stupid shorts."
"Beautiful graphics, lively navigation, refreshing designs, and sound clarity. I've been using Amazon Prime Music for over a year because it doesn't have ads but I abandoned it for Spotify; you could imagine why would anyone drop an ad-free app to come back to a limited service: quality!"
My most used app. I love sleep mode and being able to change playback speeds. The only thing I wish would go away is driving mode paired with maps. It never is intuitive or helpful for me with my Samsung. It's more distracting.
"Had Spotify premium for a while now and love it. Especially the lack of censorship to the podcasts that don't quite follow the mainstream narrative (if you know what I mean) Recently had an issue on the Android app and Spotify were amazingly quick at helping... Thanks guys for the help, thanks for not censoring like everyone else, you have my money"
need to upgrade to hi-fi quick!!
"Amazing interface, by far one of the best designed apps out there. It feels like every small aspect has been properly researched and tested - excep for adding an album in the queue, pls add it to the end of the queue not in the middle of the album I'm listening to. However casting really sucks. No I'm not listening to the 6-hour version of Imagine! Also I get that you want to add new songs in my playlist based on what I've liked but that screws up the queue and repeats song played before"
"Great clarity,easy navigation and useful buttons"
Please test your ui in dark mode time slider is not visible. Overall app and your service is best.
It's not without occasional quirks but I can always find my happy place with the amazing variety of music!
"The new UI is awful. Put the play button back in the middle, please"
Has a quite good range of music
"When using android auto, the next track button on my steering wheel skips two tracks instead of one. This is not a problem when I'm playing music through the system directly (not through android auto)."
"I love Spotify,It has let me build my library of music back up in digital format.Very Cool App.Highly Recommended!"
"The music player buttons disappeared after the last update. I love the app, please fix!"
Great app but please fix the bar the shows what song is playing and has the pause button! It keeps disappearing and the only way to get it back is to uninstall the app then reinstall it. Been going on for a while now and it is super annoying.
"Love the musics, the applications ui and ux are awesome"
"Best music streaming service period. The best UI for both mobile desktop and TV, that makes it great. Also, all podcasts are there. I did test out tidal, youtube music and deezer but this is just the best."
Quick and easy to get songs and artists
"Music queuing should be more flexible. ie, ability to queue songs up next and later like apple music"
"Service is good, app has some bugs. Play button doesn't change state after a click. I have to close the app to stop audio playback. Occasionally playback stops without any input. App installed on a Galaxy S20+."
"I like the app until, when I go offline and play my downloaded songs. It pause itself when it reaches in the middle of every 4th song, I keep clicking play and then when it reaches 4 songs again, it pauses it self again in the middle of the song. Please fix this. PLEASE FIX THISSS üëÜ Additional, I didn't turn on my shuffle but the song keeps on shuffling even if I turn off the shuffle button."
"The premium is definitely worth it! Quite inexpensive as well for students :) P.S. Very disappointed that the preview songs option while creating a playlist is removed. Just why would you do that! It was so good, now it sucks! If the changes are reverted back in a month or so consider me unsubscribed. It's not like there are no alternatives! Please fix it! Else you risk losing a lot of your listeners for sure... P.S.2 Thanks for giving it back!"
All great muisc in one place.. Very nice
"So buggy at the moment, always freezes during songs and quits the app or won't show you want is currently playing... Going to try uninstalling and reinstalling"
"Very good, little to no issues. The only problem I've had is that the now playing bar dissappears every now and then but that just requires you to force stop it from the settings. (Pretty sure this affects only Samsung users, but don't quote me on that)"
"For me Spotify is perfect. Is quick and easy to use. You can listen to music online or offline, just download the music and volai! Spotify has basically every song you could ever want, though they are some mashups and remixes that don't exist here but instead on YouTube and SoundCloud. But otherwise, 5 out of 5 for me"
"Best recommendation system, best UI best streaming service on premium if u don't have premium it's bad"
Love being able to build a playlist of my own.
Great app quickly adds new songs I like it I recommend my friends also
"Often times the app screws up by playing music without displaying the button function and album display. This means the app will play a song you select, but wont load the ""now playing"" display. Music plays for a song and a half and then it crashes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, and it still happens. Great for making playlists; not all music is found."
"The desktop app's full screen mode leaves a thin gap between the taskbar and the bottom part of the app. Also, there is no way to change the video quality inside the desktop app. Apart from that, it's great. Especially the UI."
Odd little tidbit: the player disappeared when I hit the back button and the music was still playing :/
"This app is SPOT on. (no pun intended. Well, maybe a little) As an audiophile, I really appreciate the ability to fill my ear holes with whatever suits my mood at any given moment. The side Hulu subscription is a nice bonus. Keep upthe good work and kudos for locking down Last Podcast on the Left."
"Good for designing a playlist, bad for c sides you can't find anywhere other than the tube"
I do say it is simple exquisite and I was in awe that it played more songs than my Gucci cassette player
"Quite a few commercials which is a bit annoying, but then again you can skip them!? LIKE WHAAAT LOL got to say that's dope lol . Anyway I do like Spotify overall I switched from YouTube play music to Spotify recently n my oy regret is just not switching sooner"
Great app! The enhance button was the best thing ever to find new music. Bring that on back now ya hear? üòÅ‚úåüèΩüíö
"A fantastic App.... transported back in time with a push of a button, where the whole world was open to opportunities, freedom and excitement. I miss those days üòáüëçüèª Only negative is...the App turns itself off every ten-fifteen minutes."
"This is perhaps the best music app But it lacks the feature of editting order of songs in playlists according to our choice.We have to first remove all songs and then add them again.In contrast to youtube music has this feature, we can do so by a button on the right side of each song by which songs can be moved independently according to our choice."
Good app for hearing music and podcast. I love hearing songs and I always use this app. Premium subscription rate are quite less and there are many offer though with you can subscribe.
"What's up with the button positions, who decided it was a good idea. I get it if it was on Android auto or something but on a phone seriously. Sometimes the decision you guys make baffle me. If this keeps happening you will lose customers."
Facing issues after Android 12 update in miui 13 after closing the Spotify app music player not going from notification sectionü§®ü§® and in the player song album art not showing in so many songs.. please provide a fresh and bugs fixes update for Android 12 users its sooo irritating
"I love this app because I love to draw while listening to music before I knew this app existed I always used YouTube and I couldn't listen to music while looking at my images in my gallery so this was a really big help, I just wish there was a loop button so I don't have to keep restarting it over and over again"
Amazing app. Love the design and sound quality. Premium is 100% worth it.
"I'm a new user and love it so far! My only complaint, as a free user. Is the buildup of ads played at once."
"Spotify has definitely improved a lot since I started using it a couple years ago. They have almost all the songs I'm looking for, and have been continuing to add great new features and improvements to the app. Sometimes it's a little buggy on my Galaxy A71, otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
"Spotify is the best way to listen to music on mobile or tablet. Search for any track, artist or album and listen for free. Make and share playlists. Build your biggest, best ever music collection. Get inspired with personal recommendations, and readym"
I build lists of the music I love and explore new music without limits. This is my best music buy in years.
"I've been using YouTube Music for 3 years but a few days ago I bought Spotify premium edition to see which one is better, To be honest Spotify has better playlists so it's a better app to find your new songs that you like but YouTube Music has a part that mixes songs for you but it changes every week so I think it's not good as Spotify is, But to be honest again YouTube Music has a better design for its app and if you won't spend money for Music application YouTube music's free edition is better"
"The UI is super intuitive, the premium features are cool, it just great overall. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is how it doesn't really pay artist well."
"Spotify has become smoother since my last review, so I have to clear the app out of history a lot less. I'm not a big fan of the new plus button in the bottom right corner. I don't need to make a new playlist so often that a dedicated spot in the menu is necessary and I don't make podcasts at all. This button is functionally pointless for me and moved the other buttons that I used slightly to the left. Overall, still a great app. I'm just nitpicking the constant changes to the UI."
"Hi, I updated my app to the lastest version but I still have problems on lyric sharing. Can't seem to find the button on it even after restarting my phone or clearing the data of the app itself. It would be great if you could help me on this one. Thank you!"
Spotify is the best music app ever. It give only one ads of 30 seconds and you can listen uninterrupted song for 30 min.‚ù§Ô∏è And this app has quite smooth experience üôÇ must download it.
I've used Spotify off and on for quite some time and I like it but if I had to say one thing negative I would say turn the volume down on your ads and that's it!
Very good app for listening ads its been 6 months i am listen to ads but there is some issue sometimes it play songs that ruined my mood of listening ads
I enjoy Spotify and have been using it for quite a while. My only gripe with it is that when listing to an artists mix I wish they played more of the artist and less of the similar artists.
"This is the best music platform, I admit to that especially when the user subscribes to it. But certain problems I'm not so happy with is that it doesn't refresh and show recently released hits. I'll have to see them in other apps them download them on Spotify or follow the artist. I'll still give it a complete rating, 'cause the updates lately are good. It'd be satisfactory if I hear an artist dropped a track and I see it quickly on the home page. Please work on this. It'd be acknowledged"
"New UI with the play button in the left most just feels weird, please fix it to the standard button layout."
Would be great but the 5 30 second ads kinda ruin it
Best music streaming service I have ever used. UI is simple and sophisticated. Spotify also features many personalization options that makes the app feel like it was built for you.
"Can't listen to music, playlists for ALL are showing empty. Tried Uninstalling, clearing cache, rebooting...nothing has helped. I have a paid subscription and can't use the service. Update: Customer support was quick to address the issue and offered an easy solution to the problem. Thank you."
"Great music,all the songs l grew up with at the push of a button."
Found quite the songs I like. I was hoping to get others based on my choices. Great app though.
New update... Why shuffle play button dissappear in liked songs? I want to get random music. There is only play/stop button and second button to loop playing. Please return it back!
I've been using Spotify for quite some time already. And in general it's cool. But recently I started experience problems with playing songs and podcasts in offline mode. And in general I have an impression that app became more laggy. Hope this is temporary.
Good UI but too much ads. Mostly cringe ads.
Amazing i would say I'm not premium member but I didn't give it full 5 star because sometimes the ads are quite often to the point that there would ads after every song and other is that sometimes it just stops working it doesn't show me which song I'm playing so they fixed that i would rate it 5 star without being a premium member
"Gapless playback doesn't work between end and beginning of albums, it ruins the experience of certain albums, especially Nonagon Infinity which is meant to infinity loop. Otherwise it's perfect. Also really good for learning lyrics to songs."
"I Love SpotifyüôÇ they have every song in the world, love graphics and lyric option"
"The shuffle playlist has to be improved. It keeps playing almost the same song over and over again regardless of the huge amount of music I listed in the same playlist; ultimately the reason why I get bored with my favorite songs too quickly. I hope u fix this, cuz I need a shuffle option‚Äînot selective."
"It's more money than I'd like to spend but the ad free unlimited version is worth it. Do wish they would be more understanding with the address verification with family plans as my children travel between my home and my husband as we have been separated. Sucks they don't recognize my son on our family plan bc he's only at my address part of the time. I'd also love if the playlist feature was a bit more intuitive to navigate considering I've had some from back in the ""starred"" era"
Simple to use...suggestions are easy to use and easy with a simple üëå play button
"I love the Spotify has Personal he designed playlist, That it releases weekly helps me find good new music, it's a great app"
Spotify has a large library and you can almost find every 9 out of 10 songs quickly. Spotify has become my favorite brand because of the service and overall experience. I've Premium Service so I never get hit by any ads while enjoying the music in very high quality. üëå
Spotify is a very good place to listen to music but it's not the best without premuim. But on the bright side premuim is not very expensive and in fact quite affordable it is a clever business method to earn and I'm down for it
This is the best song recommendation app. Also you can listen to podcasts which are very well designed.
"UI looks amazing, and listening experience is also good when compared to other apps. However, ads keep increasing on every new update."
"I love how the app does not require downloads, but the fact you cannot put songs on repeat without premium really sucks"
Great user experience with a cheap premium option that make listening very enjoyable without ads. The AI is fantastic and suggests songs I have never heard of that match my music taste
"I am fully satisfied with the musics heard during my work, actually not listening to the words but encouraged with the rhythm for continuing my work....."
"No adds, loads quickly, and all the music I like!"
"Most recent update is the worst yet. Extreme lag, constantly having to restart the app, and the new Library feature is 10 steps back from the previous UI. Please address these issues or I will no longer be paying for this service."
"Phone remote to tablet to stereo(s), excellent programming. Excellent entertainment. Spotify is so good you just might quit watching tv...Fantastic playlist generator, and perfect operation with only 2G of freespace. And You, You will have fun-guaranteed-and thats just the free version. Home cache clear."
Great app for streaming. Except randomly stops playing and I have to push the play button to get it going again.
Outstanding music streaming. Even obscure music can be found. Rarely issues and when they occur they are fixed quickly.
"That last couple update have systematically broken the app. Connections to devices are buggy and intermittent. UI has broken a dozen times a day and won't respond, play anything, and when it does the wrong item will show as playing versus the sound. Can't skip what it doesn't know it's playing!.. Reinstall and restarts are no help. ""No internet connection"" even when I am on the god damn wifi and in a city. Straight up broken at the moment."
"Perfect -- extremely well designed, seamless across all my devices, fast/responsive, simple interface. Kudos to the development team and UI designers."
"Hi,I love this app but when I play my playlist it as songs I didn't put on it also can you add a loop button I hate that I can't hear my favorite song over and over again I'm sorry if I'm sounding mean but I just want a loop button and not listen to songs that I did add to my playlist please that's all."
"Was reading some reviews and im quite disapointed, so many complains about skiping or ads or songs added to a playlist, please upgrade to premium. The COMPANY and the ARTISTS are not making any money from free accounts, and then you hear most complains from these individuals, if you cant afford it yet pls dont give 1 to 2 stars to an app that you are freeloading from. Our plan is spot family, P214($3.8) for 6 fam members, that is P36 ea person/ month. Doesnt even dent ur monthly income friends"
"This app is great. The only problem that I have with it is that it is really laggy. Some of my songs won't play will use my skips. Also, I'll use one skip and the app won't let me use any more of my skips. This was all a while ago but I thought I should let you guys know. I have premuin now and it works great."
I've been listening to music with Spotify for well over a decade. It's been really cool watching it grow into the app I now know and love. It's super helpful that I can search for songs by lyrics and song recognization. I do wish the player would automatically show up in my push notifications like it used to on my old phone but I think that's more of a design flaw in my new device's software.
I like it but now there is a bug now when I press the repeat button the app crashes that's all I have experienced I will up fate you guys more but still this is a great app!

Personalization is their Forte love having Playlists designed just for me!!! DAILY
"It be pretty aight if you don't skimp the premium downloads go by quick on not the best internet so you don't need a GOATED or God CPU ETC, ETC bing bong ¬£u‚Ç¨k ya life‚Ñ¢"
"I love it the only thing is that I wish the UI/UX was more fluid and less boxy, and I wish that I could DISABLE lyrics instead of always having it on"
Love this app.. but why is it everytime I'm in my feels listening to sad music a ad comes on atp I don't even wanna cry anymore u ruined it. U guys are like listening to me cry it seems like it üòª.
Gives great music at touch of a button
Very useful in a quite time
"I want to know what happend the collaborative button because now i cant add songs on others people's playlist. I updated it many times but the collabrative button wont pop up, and also can you guys put a spotify chat system on there its gettin really boring trying to talk by putting songs on other people's playlist Overall its great."
The app was great until it changed my play/pause button from middle to left. I asked twitter support for help but they couldn't rectify the problem after multiple attempts. they changed back
"It's the go to app for music. The swipe gesture was a long awaited and great addition. It would be worth 5 stars, but I have unliked songs too many times accidentally due to the position of the like button. If it were only visible inside the player it would mean less accidental touches."
Love the quality and availability of my favourite by a push of a button
"Spotify changed my whole world after my son told me about it years ago. What? They have full albums? They have albums from the 70's?? Tears were shed as I would have a musical memory, do a quick search, and bam! The Best of Bread, Twin Sons of Different Mothers, Rumours --it doesn't get any better than this. Totally worth it people.üíóüíóüíó"
"App crashing of recently , and the search bar gets masked partially by the top indicator panel of the ui , in pixel 4a"
"Thank you for returning back normal position of media control buttons. Please, avoid this kind of experiments in the future."
"I just wanna recommend adding the music search quality like ""Shazam"". The one where we can know a song name quicker"
"Hello! I'm new to Spotify and this is my first time using it. I'm loving it so far! I just have a few suggestions, 1. In the music player, we should be able to swipe down and up without having to use the arrow. 2. A double tap to seek for about 10 seconds would be really nice to add. 3. In the mini music player, we should be able to swipe down to get rid of it. 4. More animations when you click the pause and play button would make Spotify better. And 5. Sometimes the app will crash after opening"
very good with all types of music to suit everyone.
One suggestion: Add shuffle and repeat buttons to the mini player in lock screen
I think that the app is great it works well and has atleast 99% of the songs I like saying I'm a k-pop fan but it glitches pretty often I don't know if it happens to other people too but it happens for me quite often please fix this.
Pretty easy to use and organized UI/UX
Exceptional application and exquisite terms of use.
"I don't if it's just me or what, but I hate it when the share lyrics button removed on my spotify, I'd suggest to put that feature again."
Doesn't have streaming issues n it quite entertaining and you gotta get it if u don't already have it
"Quite easy, not at all what I expected. But, as they say never expect have hope."
Why does the lyrics share button keep disappearing?
Please bring back the notif button for offline mode. Huhuhu. i'll give you 5 stars if you do that üòä
"this app is good, but sometimes there are bugs, like recently the buttons are kind of not in their right positions which is weird lol."
Been with Spotify for years now and love it the app is amazing especially on tvs great services üëè really impressed with it done a good job especially the premium listening i to offline where ever i go its amazing 2022: recently with the new update the sound quality has gotten quiter and idk y it must be to due with the update I compared it with sound cloud same song and on sound cloud its louder. Spotify can u please fix this.
"Quite cool and interesting,so far good I can recommend other funs to install it"
"The overall experience is good. Asian songs, especially Chinese songs have less resources. The UI of the lyrics display module can be more beautiful."
"It's alright, I just don't know what to say but I know something isn't intriguing me. I don't know I think old Spotify is better ü§î"
"One little bug where what was playing wouldn't come up, preventing the ability to pause. Fixed quickly, and been absolutely great otherwise."
All in one service that allows me to access my library across devices. I love the UI as well as the easy to understand functionalities this app comes with.
"Later edit: Ok, this was fixed, after some updates.Please leave the + and - buttons near each other, in my list (library) for adding/removing proposed songs. Also it would be nice we could have some filters or a way to arrange the songs in the created lists"
Every update requires that I reinstall the app in order for it to work properly and it will mess up any alarms linked to the app. Stop making things that already work worse!
Very quick and easy. Love it!
I love Spotify so much. Although I would like a customizable UI to make it better.
"So far, so good. Good design collection as well!"
Great selection of music and the ability to quickly create your own playlist that can be public or private.
Spotify has always worked just fine for me just wish premium was free but hey Rome wasn't built in a day
Love the intuitive play lists.
"Everything is really good. easy to use, good design, big community and song collection. Hope for better sound quality. And maybe some social features, could really raise the time spent on app. More widgets please."
"Awesome!! Thank you to the creators of Spotify!! I fu ki' love it!!! You guys have introduced me to the most wicked singles and subsequent albums. Truly, emphatically, I'm virtually certain I will never require another music platform. (Perhaps the integration of artist videos would be appreciated by many of your 'loyal subjects'). Again, Dear Spotify constitutents, THANK YOU!!!!!!!"
Good app but quite laggy when moving the audio time.
"The easiest music player I have ever used....original and cleaned music and songs are there...You can create playlist as your preference and list manually....especially in laptop web version and for tablets, it's fully free but cannot download music....there are ads available but which is not much annoying...So, newcomers why are you still waiting here...just tap the install button & explore the unlimited music universe..."
"Please do include ""Add to playlist"" shortcut as a button.üôÇ"
"Finally Spotify has matured into a decent app worth paying for. A few issues remain: (1) no indicator on playlist screen to show if sequential play or shuffle play is active. Imho there should be two separate buttons, ie a standard play button and a shuffle button with suitable colour change when active. (2) should have an ""AI"" button to play more songs like this based on past listening history. (3) Need ""hey Spotify"" voice commands, especially when driving. Keep up the innovation üëç"
Great app honestly but sometimes when you choose a particular song it plays a completely different song and that's quite annoying but otherwise it's great and highly reccomend
"I personally love this app! The UI is good and the app itself look kinda cute. The music quality is really good. The best part is that it gives my daily mood mixes and weekly mixes too which is very accurate to the kinds of songs I listen. The discover features isn't for discovering random songs but of genres/styles you prefer. The reason to give 4 star is because of too many annoying ads. You can at least remove ads in certain playlists like ""meditation"" or ""study"" Overall it's pretty good!"
Recent update has ruined this app. Good UI and app was great before. Now music constantly stops and app crashes or doesn't load.
"Good app, but it's been quite annoying lately sometimes when I'm playing a game while listening to any music it randomly stops and I have to go back in to fix it, Why does it even do that? It's annoying.."
"Idk what are people on. Awesome app as always. Just pay 5 bucks or just stay quiet. Five bucks is nothing and by paying it, every door opens up. And no, there are no adds on Spotify Premium. Never was."
I find the app quite pleasent. It has nice music and it gives you songs you might like according to the previous songs you have listened to.
"Amazing, easily the best UI and music app in general I've seen anywhere."
Excellent app. Music to suit everyone and every mood or event. Love it.
"Love Spotify, but please move the ""heart"" button so it's not next to the ""cast"" button. I unheart songs all the time and it is so annoying!!! Please move the cast icon to the left of the song titles rather than kn the right next to the play/pause."
"All good except ads. Ads are too annoying to be tolerated! The same ads are played in a loop. Now the app have become quite expensive in its way. Previously it used to give 3 months premium free for any premium pack, but now it reduced to 1 month....."
This is really interesting app because this help me as motivation guide
"App has gotten a lot better. Still prefer the old UI, but eh... What are you gonna do."
Best songs collection and UI
"Generally works great. But many times I've used the app the screen freezes, or control bar desappears and I need to quit app for it to appear again. Also, doesn't work well while traveling with google maps directions... it attempts to share screen and map doesn't work well"
Enjoy the largest collection of music with excellent quality and inbuilt adjustments of the app
Nice and all but there's quite a lot of updates?
"It was a decent application with a lot of advertisement. Less gigabits needed for quick music listening in the background. The premium feature isn't even comparable to YouTubes version, since it is often more expensive for less content and sometimes the advertisement can longer, since you can't skip there and all ads r 30sec."
Great app but songs will get stuck and you can't move on from that track no matter what you do to troubleshoot. Spotify is aware of the issue that's been happening for quite some time but no fix in sight.
"Been waiting for the update with lyrics on phone for quite a while but I still don't see them even though I have Premium. I have clean uninstalled and reinstalled the newest version multiple times, logged out back in twice as suggested in forums but no luck. It works on all my friends Android devices. Desktop version shows them for me. Unfinished/broken features on paid subscriptions is a big red flag for me. Gonna drop the rating to 1 star till fixed."
Great service! And a pretty crisp design
"The coustmer service is the best...they reply the mails quickly and it takes maximum 2 days for them to fix any problem within the app ....well it was 2 days for me. I enjoy the premium, and to be true i loved that they have premium for University students, and it's very cheap."
Thanks for reverting the playback control buttons to their initial places.
The app has been quite easy to use. So far I have had no issues with it.
This app makes finding the music that suits you easy. It can also pair with several devices enabling you access to the convenience that it provides. This app truly is a masterpiece and I encourage the developer's to keep adding more cutting edge software into the interfaces and security aspects.
Simple and easy to use design. Grrat for looking up new songs. Especially for when i need that hype somg for new PR attempts inthe gym. Plus podcasts. Its good.
Hi I love this app so much but there is only 1 problem why I can't open ishowspeed shake song can. U please fix this ;( i can't quit this app I love it so much
"Been a Spotify Premium member for years and wouldn't change a thing. It's the gold standard in streaming music. Quite simply, Apple Music was too late to the party and I've never felt the need to switch. Spotify gets everything right, hands down."
"Seamless streaming, intuitive recommendations and every artist you could hope to find."
Crystal clear quality of sound and quick update of new release
UI is back to normal now but I keep getting a premium tab even tho I already have premium. Doesnt affect anything and just returns me to where I last was but kinda weird
"Spotify in a nutshell: ""hey this person is genuinely enjoying this song/playlist & playing it often. Y'know what, let's hoard it away & put a bunch of ads in it so that if that person has depression or something worse & this song makes them happy, they can't listen to it! I mean, who cares what they want/do to themselves unless they're paying for premium! üòÄ"" Music is power & you're taking that away with this bs. I'm giving this 4 stars since u don't respond to ur 1 star reviews. fix the system."
Thanks for bringing back the playlist button. Now it's perfect.
"Love this app & the team behind it. Once I had a problem on my PC: Arch Linux, Gnome desktop environment and they managed to fix it within a single day! Nothing I would expect from such a big company."
"I love the app but there's alot more music that could be out on there, like ""ballout"" by (juice wrld) lol but yeah all in all the app is great"
"I love being able to make my own Playlists and listen to my favorite music. Amazing ui interface, and easy to navigate with a plethora of options."
Great UI and good Playlists
"Great music App and sharing platform. Menus/ choices are a not intuitively placed requiring you to explore but, works well."
"Music is great, but Spotify keeps asking for Bluetooth access which I already gave and now the play button moved to the left which is an odd choice. Maybe a bug?"
I have been using many music aps in the past 10 years or so... I find Spotify the best one in terms of functanality and ease of use... Still few improvements required like usage in poor network areas... Need to fix that
Spotify has become my go-to music platform for a while now. Really appreciate the work that goes into this app. I got premium and spent 20k minutes last year listening to music on here üòÖ. I have one genuine feature request - blocking podcasts / removing them from suggestions on the home screen. Love you guys!
"Get rid of the "" Hidden"" button. I accidentally hit the button but I could not find an option to bring the song back. Thank God, I was able to figure out the name of the song to add back to my Playlist."
"The app is tremendously great. The features and everything is convenient ranging from category of music, lyrics of the songs, and etc. The only thing that I find odd is the volume of the songs. They play somehow quiet in the Normal volume range. I suggest that you try to make it louder at that. The lyrics also should be downloaded offline also in case you want to sing but do not have available WiFi connection. That is all. The app is wonderful. But some adjustments would be fine."
"Love it! The interface, UI UX, stopped using all other music app... But I am finding it hard to make payment tho .."
I love it but the only thing holding me back from giving this a 5 star is the car UI now being a premium option.
Very neat. Really good UI and very enjoyable
"Wonderful! I would love a bit more intuition for the Android app like the Apple version is, but it does the job. Most of my songs recommended aren't similar to what I listen to, but you'll find a nugget or two. Neat stuff"
Overall good experience nice interface I am totally satisfy with spotify every experience but if you reduce 1 month charges 89 rupees genuinely i am glad and It's become a more good option for music lover and I will recommend
"I love Spotify it is really good to use. Although the shuffle button has been driving me crazy. Every time I go on a Playlist the shuffle button is always there, and I hate the shuffle button because I put my favorite songs in a certain order, and when I shuffle my music it goes out of order and then it plays only five songs and then goes on autoplay when I know I have more than five songs on every Playlist. I want the version where we just had the play button. Not just the shuffle button."
They changed the now playing back thank God!! Old review: Why change the now playing page UI and take away the lyrics button? What backwards A/B testing is this???
Super app it recommended song which suits our mood
"The app is great but sometimes I'm indecisive of what I want to listen to, I just want to listen to something. Can you maybe add a button like the one netflix has (surprise me) or something. That would be really great especially if it plays something related to the kind of music we listen to. Wonderful app nevertheless."
Overall great experience. Shuffle feature could be a bit more intuitive. Would be a 5* otherwise.
Great app to listen to mdu favorite music. Simple and premium price is affordable. Sound quality is fantastic. Its a great feature that we can download songs. Also i have a suggetion to add playback speed buttona
"New UI looks sleek but the lyrics powered by Musixmatch it's not synchronised correctly even though the sync timing is correct on the desktop version and in Musixmatch itself. Adding Oled Dark Mode (Pitch Black), dark mode (The Usual) and light mode (System White) would also be great."
I been on Spotify for years. Continue to build with multiple classics...
Top notch Features with Clean UI. Just Amazing ü§©
"Thank you for fixing the button order, that's the way it should be :)"
Over all experience really good it's just and rather often the app just quits and I'll have to reboot to fire it back up fix that you have yourself a hell of a station Thank you
Thanks for placing the play/ pause button controls back to it's original position!
"Since I first started suing Spotify at the turn of 2021, I have actually been flabbergasted at the range and variety of music that is on here; there is literally nothing that I can think of that I lhave not been able to find boatload's of, it really is mind blowing; I have enough to listen to 24/7, and that for me is a big deal. I rate Spotify as worth every pound/dollar, or Euro, and then some. Angelo GB."
We want only three bottom buttons > home search library . So please remove 4th premium button in Android app thank you.
"Still Great! The new changes, and improvements you have made are stellar. Thank you for continuing to work so hard, to make all the music available, available to all the people. Jam On!!"
"The app overall is a good app but for those who don't get the premium subscription, at first there a re very little ads but as time goes by the number of ads start to increase. Something like 5 ads before a 2 min music. But the ux(user experience) is very good"
Having to reset my phone everytime I get out of my car because the app has recently decided that a pause button is t needed is getting pretty annoying
Quite easy to search the search the song I need and that's all for now
It takes two attempts to open this app in Android Auto. If I am using I heart radio it won't switch to Spotify on the first try. It always takes two pokes at the Spotify button to open Spotify. This has been corrected.
"I like using this app, nothing is bugging, crashing or causing errors, everything is great. The only thing I complain about is the ""Shuffle"" button in my playlists. I can't select a song on my own because Spotify plays random songs itself,no matter what cover I click, it will autoplay what the cover sounds like and then stop. This may not happen if you buy premium, however not everyone can afford it. My conclusion is that Spotify needs a feature where shuffling is an optional and not permanent."
Would give 5 star if they had less ads honestly ruins the app and in 2022 only rich people cab afford premium bc we all broke
I love this app. It's amazing but the reason I gave it 4 stars is the removal of the loop button. I'd love the app to bring it back without us paying just for that one button which will last like 1 month or something. The app made me disappointed due to the useless removal. And if love if we wouldn't pay for the offline listening too because it's just a uselss removal (again) . The app is amazing but needs those little things back just for the sake of it. I honestly think these removals a bad.
"I've only just started using it, but it's so much better than Amazon music. It has a wider range of music and it's world music library is amazing. I even found an album by my old music teacher Luis Morais from Cabo Verde. Check him out, you won't be disappointed."
I refuse to switch services and/or use ANY OTHER MUSIC APP. I love Spotify SO much I low-key recruit people to join the team. We're all winners here. üíöüñ§
"Been playing a different 'mood' every day . Spotify is quite smart like that. Today, 'Calipso.'"
I love Spotify! The music selection is a music üíï dream. When Spotify put The Faragher Brother on it's stream I was thrilled. With that being said other streaming app have music I enjoy that can't be streamed on Spotify. I have discovered music mentioned in films because Spotify name was linked to the song. I enjoy how Spotify pay attention to my listening pattern and build excellent playlist for me.
I've used Spotify for a long time and it's never failed to remain consistent. It's also been extremely quick to notify me when my favorite artists and bands have new music releasing.
Adverts are a real nuisance:-(
"The service is easy to use. The UI is simple, yet elegant, responsive and easy to navigate."
Music comes out very clear but when connect to Bluetooth headphones gets very quiet can barely hear the music even with volume turned all the way up
The best app to listen music online i use free version but I didn't a lot of ads it's better than others music in ADS and ui
We need more widgets and new widget UI
"How can you not give 5 stars to your own personel jukebox for $10 a month! As a music fanatic from a very early age to playing guitar for almost 40 years, this is the greatest thing technology can do for me, in my car, at home, on my phone, and they even have my album on here! ""KEGASAURUS WRECKS"" c'mon man! Thank you Spotify!!"
"Incredible app, i myself as a EDM artist, song writer, producer and Dj love this place. Great place to start off as a new artist, and also a great place to build reputation."
"Edit 09/06: They fixed it, thanks! Who ever signed off on having the ""go back"" button replaced by the ""like"" button in the notification bar please reverse it. People don't click like on songs nearly as much as they click on previous track."
It was quiet good . And also lyrics is available that help me to understand how to pronounce according to the songs ... I like it.....
"I actually like this app, no complain but i really want spotify to do some changes regarding its lyrics feature. I really like song like punjabi, k-pop, and other languages song i wish i could convert these lyrics in english and could understand the lyrics in better...all i could do is search in Google for it's lyrics which is quite troublesome..."
It's a good app but the background of the app is quiet dull and out dated. I think there should be an option for a light mode like apple music.
"Spotify meets all your need and music you like to listen to on a daily basis! no matter what Genre, spotify is accessible and available to all and has a great premimuim monthly deal for those who do not like adds and skip songs on the daily."
"Please allow people to change theme, I personally don't like apps with black design."
Better recommendations than any other music service providers. Nothing's quiet like it!
Really like it. Quite intuitive.
"Phenomenal selection of music, excellent quality and a user friendly gui makes this a great app. Thank you the Developers."
I wish I didn't need to retype an artist everytime I add a song to a playlist. It gets annoying when youre not quite sure which version of the song you want or you want multiple songs from the same artist
Wow! Spotify is so wonderful üíï it works quickly and it's very easy to use itüëèüëè
"I don't have anything bad to say a far as the app is. It's a little bit pricey for anything other than the free account. It could have less adds in between but I know that's how they keep it free. A shuffle button for all the play list would be great so one could access longer music play. I still think it's the best app to listen to really anything but Garth Brooks, and maybe a few others that don't release for free, understandable they got to make up for tickets master fee to simply print."
"Spotify is the best, if you're a music lover I recommend you guiz to download this."
"Except the fact that there's no dislike button, been using it for at least a month now, and I can say that I've enjoyed every bit of it. üëçüëç But y'all should seriously try to implement the dislike button option aswell"
"Undoubtedly one of the best music app. It has curated the UI very well. Podcasts are also from very wide range. But recently for last 10 days I'm facing a serious issue, the app is not working. Whenever I play any song it just crashes. So i uninstall the app and again install the app, but it didn't work, after few days again it starts working,and again after few days it got crashed. Please üôè kindly solve your bugs."
Hi uhm... Spotify app is really good although the offline button does not work for me please make it work in on Android btw
Old previous/pause/next song design was good. Now they have shifted play button ot the bottom.
This App is perfectly fine dark theme mode i love it suits me wonderfully love everything of this App But recently i don't like what it does it undownloads some of my albums i have enough storage but it still does that than i have to download them all over again for why if i already downloaded them Spotify is upsetting me lately. But what i llike actually not like but love the fact that it gives you a few days to pay your account because sometimes my money isn't in the bank right away AWESOME!!!
"I would like a ""dislike"" button so i can tell the app not to place that song in my randomized lists again. Besides that, this is the best music app."
Need for an audio search button for music.
In love with the app and the musics in particular But i think there should be a download button For each song in an album
"I loved it It had best experience instead of other applications. But after latest update, When I open it it automatically closes Please fix this quickly as possible......"
"Mobile version for free is pretty awful but as soon as I got a job I was able to pay for the student plan and it's great. I love the local files features, I learned to create folders so I can easily organize all my playlists and the UI is easy to understand"
"Spotify was the best thing that happen to life. Work and studying are so much easier with spotify, and I have music for every mood Im in, even if Im not awake, and if I need something to fall asleep too, I only hape to press one button."
Great sound and the way a person can build a playlist fantastic!!Superb!!
It's an amazing app for music lovers like me. ads became less than before UI is also good but music recommendation is not satisfying. That's why I rated only 4 star.
I'm looking forward having the equivalent of qobuz within Spotify some day. But until then I very pleased from the app and the recommendation engine and the Playlist generated for me. Already 6 years a customer;-)
This app Is Amazing overall That's why I give it 5 stars I'm not going to take away a star but how come You can choose to listen to a specific song on pc/laptop but not mobile seems quite unfair That we need premium
If you love and even NEED to have music on your phone then you NEED this app. Cannot say enough good things about these guys and their well designed app.
"There are many things that the other apps lead in: Amazon and Deezer in HiFi audio (which I hope Spotify will add soon) and Youtube Music in unofficial tracks. However, the reason I have chosen to go with Spotify is because of UI and friends. While YT and Deezer have nice UI's also, they don't have the same aesthetic as Spotify. The only thing I would say is to RELEASE HIGH FIDELITY!! EDIT: I have switched to Tidal until HiFi is released."
"Great music service. Loads quick, easy search, works on all of my home devices. Fast downloads."
Speakers to your best liking equalizer they should have an equalizer on this app to where it's built in to where you can modify the music
Great music app except the adds all other things are quit well. My experience with Spotify is really mindblowing.
"It's quite a good app all the music you want and some you weren't even looking for! Overall, it's a banger and I hope you enjoy the app as much as I did!"
I use the free version so far. I'm trying to learn how to make playlists. It's quite confusing. But I love Spotify.
"I have had Spotify for years...then as my children grew, I took the family package. We absolutely LOVE Spotify. We each use it on a daily basis. Music is a must in our home and to have absolutely everything under the shining sun, at the touch of a button...just brilliant! The app is easy to navigate and I love how the majority of the songs have the lyrics below. Quite honestly, if I had to, i'd give up any other luxury before even contemplating giving up Spotify."
I'm in love with Spotify but ads ruins the experience
"Hello Spotify , I am using spotify Premium for like more than 4 months now. I Love the service , Application UI , Features But One area that need to be work upon is When two people are streaming together , group remote session , I just try with one of my other friend not more . She was using her Laptop and I was streaming from my Phone so whenever I switch to some other song , Her connection to remote streaming is lost she has to join again and again which sometime is really irritating."
"i think getting lyrics from Music Match was a great move. a lot of the lyrics are incorrect and some are incomplete. the Mah 2022 update has been quite glitchy, often forcing the app to stop abruptly"
"Only recent issue I've discovered is that for some reason, the Spotify info quit displaying on my Galaxy A71 AOD screen!? I've tried everything and still quit working a month ago!"
Sometimes The Playlist I am playing not plays the next song it plays any other song from a old playlist I selected (Even After I close and open again it doesn't get fixed). Kindly make a refresh button for songs or playlist. Thank You
App keeps crashing when I press play the play button after the new update. Will change my score once this is fixed. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and it still doesn't fix the issue. Using a Vivo X70 Pro. *Updated review* Issue fixed
Music lovers dream app. Truly exceptional and expands ones Musical pursuits in ways unexpectedly.Brilliant.
"Awesome app! Love it! Easy to use and search for different songs and artist. Many good functions that makes it an all-around app. To put it simpel, it have almost everything you need and its easy to use. Just hope they bring back the ""dislike button"" you could click on songs or artist you don't like so they won't automatically play anymore, that was one of my favorite futures! Great work otherwise! :)"
"Great app except for 1 crucial missing feature - Bring back the dislike/hide button feature. If I don't want to listen to something, I should have the option to hard block/hide it"
"For whatever the reason, my layout is completely messed up. You know when you listen to a song and the pause button is in the middle surrounded by previous and next? Well not for me. And I have no idea why it is like that. I tried logging out and in and it goes back to normal but the moment I exit the app it messes up again."
What happened to the shuffle feature? That big button at the top was ideal.
"Spotify has been the best music app have seen in my entire life, kudos to the originator, from the graphics and composure all are top notch üëåüèæü•∞"
im loving the spftware but the ui is not to the bar its laggy sometimes and i think there should be an option to reshuffle songs in playlists
Spotify is the best! I've never come across anything like it. I've downloaded many of these music apps but I always end up deleting them cos they don't exactly suit my taste and at some point I concluded I'm probably not a music person but not this time. Spotify it is!!! Where have you been all my life!
I quite like the usability of the app
"Long time user. First time reviewer. As a listener I have always had an excellent user experience and I love the contextual listening it provides. I have discovered a lot of new artists, who I then support by buying their merch, attending their shows when they are in my area. I have been using (paid) for almost a decade. I love the the flow between devices: desktop to mobile, tv to tablet. Very easy to move with from home to vehicle to on a walk."
I am quite pleased with Spotify üòä learned about it from a friend
"This is indeed the best music platform you'll ever find on play store. It has a high quality music audio, amazing graphics and much more, definitely recommending it!!"
I've rated 5 star before ... But now the app is crashing constantly can't play a single song ... When I hit the play button it crashes. I'm a premium user and for the past week Spotify is utterly useless for me. Fix the issue
A quick music app which not buffer like others
"Great app. They play latest and old music to suit every client. The app plays smooth and doesn't have connection interruptions. I actually appreciate the adds on the app because the service it provides saves me a lot of money, time, and research. I just love Spotify. Great work guys"
I highly recommend this app for anyone that loves listening to music. It's offers you the chance to listen to any song that best suit your moment.üî•üíØüöÄ
Brilliant if u buy premium which is quite expensive. If u don't by premium it's rubbish and better using YouTube but if u can afford it it's definitely worth it.
"I think Spotify is the best music app. It's not perfect though, the UI still feels choppy and laggy sometimes, the songs aren't that highest quality that we assume they are. And the songs queue interface instill bad. But apart from that, Spotify's algorithm is just the industry leading. I mean I just cannot use any other music streaming service to listen and explore music at the same time. And some Spotify exclusive podcasts."
I love spotify so much. There's a ton of songs and it's an overall great app. I wish spotify premium wasn't so expensive though. 10 dollers a month is quite steep for what your getting.
Great music choices! Sound is great! Love it! Keep the sound playing in background but be able to mute or pause button control could be added forvconvenience!
I love how you can build your own playlist
"has stopped working, just a second after pressing the play button the app crashes, every time."
"Spotify is one of those apps thats hyped up so much that people expect to much from it. Without premium it's an add fest but with it it's better by about 100%. Unlimmited skips, no annoying ads, and good quality when streaming. the only things I find annoying about the app is 1. It has a remove all downloads button directly above clear cache and I've deleted all downloads so many times when trying to clear cache. 2. The quality of the app is getting progressively worse with many many updates"
"Love this app. Great library, great sound, very nice and intuitive interface. Tried Tidal and it didn't compare with the User interface. A seamless experience.... Just waiting for the HiFi edition now! üòä"
"It's great but they don't watch movies or shows for the songs English translation, I'm bubble the movie there is an English translation of bubble the song and in how the realist rebuilt the kingdom their is a English version of one of aimi songs. They could also do different versions, for the non English speakers and the English speakers."
"Its been my main music app for years, love that it gives you suggestions for new stuff to build lists with and makes it super simple to find more by artist/genre etc."
"This app keeps crashing when using any GPS app. It will crash, if not left open and my GPS apps are on picture on picture. If I have the screen to my GPS apps, Google maps and Hammer, and Spotify in the background, Spotify will play for less than a minute then crash. To get Spotify to work again, I have to hit my pages button, hit the Spotify app, and wait up to 3 minutes for it to come back and continue playing, but it will continue playing 3 minutes before it crashed. Update: its been better"
"Guys literally, do you want to delete your app or what?. TOO MUCH ADS. 3 - 4 ads in a row, do you even know how much disturbing and disgusting it is. Ruins the mood completely."
"Attention Spotify? you probably won't read this but I always want to give suggestions so here I go. - when you search up playlists I wish you had a ""sort"" button for I can choose the playlist with the most likes. - I wish you had a ""select all"" button or a ""mass select"" type option on our liked songs list and gave us the option to make the songs we chose a playlist that's about it. thanks for reading."
Please turn off the bluetooth headphone requirements. We shouldn't have to solely rely on Spotify's casting software to be able to listen to music via just the watch speaker. Every time i pause on the watch i have to play it from the phone again or the watch app wants me to connect a pair of headphones.
"Very quick and easy to use, can listen to music anywhere I go through my mobile."
I am very happy with this app. Playlist are very easy to build edit and use. You have music I am surprised to find and can't find on other sites
"Very nice one complaint is sometimes it requires you to buy premium to play your personalisation but it's kind of rare so overall amazing platform, great songs,podcasts and other related items!"
I wish it would quit showing the same music every day but other than that it's a very good app and you can always find any song or album that you were looking for.
I love Spotify but I can't shuffle my music anymore it just has that play button
Cant get reception occasionally. The music will plY the first tune but will stop in the second tune.Will play again on pressing any button. Plz help
"Quite useful and entertaining, however, there are some downsights for instance; not being able to listening to unpopular musics or the special covers of the musics are limited most of the time. What I mean is the song variety is not the way that I want it to be. Other than that, the best music app which provides the suprerior sound quality among the others."
It's available on so much media equipment that you can listen to your music everywhere.
It's very nice but you can't really listen to individual songs and if you don't have premium the ads can get quite annoying. Besides that it's awesome!
"One can create multiple play list, and each with different type of music. Very flexible and intuitive menus and more"
"Well designed app, great music and podcasts. I appreciate how well it is put together!"
great way to choose music to suit your mood
Noice app üëç but should work on lyrics interface.It looks quite boring
"I've been using Spotify Premium for years but lately it's been crashing more, my downloads haven't been appearing properly and the user experience has been sub par."
I just updated the app. And there seems to be a problem with the widget. It's unable to load. Any fix? I'm on Android 9 EMUI 9.1 Huawei Y9 2019
"I love the design and the delivery. I just realised it compatible with my Google Mini Home, and booom, its fun üòÑ time."
"I left Spotify for about 2 months to try Amazon music. Worst app for music and now back using Spotify again. Doesn't crash, doesn't pause for laooding each song streaming, doesn't require restarts multiple times."
After a while I am discovering new good music upon my musical taste. I don't really like the way you've shuffled the play buttons.
If it ain't broke don't fix it. I stand by this. So don't go messing with the UI now we've all gotten used to it lol
Did the menu change for anyone else because my play and stop button are on the left now and the skip buttons (both directions) are next to it on the right so it's not symmetrical and it's honestly giving me anxiety and i want it back the way it was before :( other than that and the fact some songs aren't on there it's a great app
"I love the enhance feature, but for some reason the enhance feature for my liked songs has dissapeared. That enhance feature was quite useful, so i'm quite dissapointed it doesn't work for my likes playlist anymore"
"The only drawback is that the app doesn't allow to go to the previous track (if i use a headphone/earphone that has only one button) When i actually use the one button earphone it works by pressing twice to forward to the next track, press thrice to go to the previous track, press once it pauses the song and so on. Please developers make this option available. Thanksüëçüèº"
Best UI experience for any Music app out there
The best music app ever. Very intuitive
"What is there NOT to Like?? -- This app is Very Intuitive as to what I am thinking, what I want, & when I want it, -- wish I Could say the Same About my Girlfriend. Lol"
Op... But there should be 10 sec forward button in phone version too... And why discover button is not available for me anymore
"I absoloutely love Spotify, It's so easy to use, it's quick to work etc. You can listen anywhere, and if you buy Premium the whole experience is even better. Everything you would want to litsen to is on here. 10/10 would recommend. I love listening to music on here:) The only thing that could use improving is the amount of adverts for people without Premium. There's quite a lot of them. Apart from that, it is absoloutely perfect."
It is quite good. It can get 5 stars but the only problem is that whenever I want to read any song's lyrics it just says no internet connection but it plays all the song perfectly. I even tried reinstalling it but it didn't work. It can be the perfect app only if you solve this problem. It is a request to please have a look at my problem and try to solve it as fast as possible. Otherwise it is the best app that can ever be.
please revert the play button placement ..
"I like this app very much. But unfortunately, I pressed the button that puts the song in the TV. And I didn't want that to happen. But now it's all good. So, thanks for making this app awesome!"
Excellent!!! I ‚ù§ myself some Spotify music! I can fix my music to suit my listening ear. I ‚ù§ it. Try it for yourself.
"Hmmm the new session joining is inconsistent. And requires you to have to the other people's Handphone number. Or telegram. Not joining the same device as host anymore eg. if I (non host) were to play YouTube, it would end up pausing the entire session. Spotify sharing links not working"
Quite a few ads but really good!
Why can't I access the search button easily in my liked songs section without having to scroll all the way up to search?
It great state of the arts ingenuity that makes the app one of the best that has verities selections.
"SPOTIFY IS SUPERB, but ADS makes me wanna suicide. Please do something of these ads. And it would be awesome if you guys made organising and customizing playlists more easy and compatible. But come on, please do something of the ads. (YOURS ADS MAKES MORE SURE TO NOT BUY YOUR PREMIUM)"
"Great app. Has almost all the songs I look for. Their premium family plan is so so worth it. There's absolutely no restrictions on playlists and other such organisations for the paid plan. Useful features are added quite frequently. Love the swipe to add to queue feature. Song and playing radios, and other song suggestions are quite apt"
"It's awesome experience,it is on point when it comes to fresh music üé∂ no hustle just a ticky of a button"
Ez to use and very quick app
"Best music app, i have ever use. I really loved the design and specially that almost every song has a lyrics. The fun thing is that it helps of make playlist share with friends and families and it also has a option to keep it private. I love this app"
the playback fails when you hit the 15 sec back button. it does not work especially hitting it repeatedly to go back a few minutes. Its quite irritating when podcast listening and driving.
Mind blowing app my all favouite song available in this app
"For the most part, and I mean about 95% of the time, I don't have any issues. Only issues I have are typically with the connection and the program saying there is no internet connection when there is, but the issues is typically solved fairly quick."
Best app for music! The free version is itself well enough and you can listen songs from various artists and it is really cool. The UI is simple and you can customize the app's interior‚ù§Ô∏è..I love this app!
The now playing widget that shows when you're on other apps or the lockscreen has disappeared on my Samsung S21 Ultra. Was helpful when you want to quickly skip tracks. Now have to go back in to the app to do this. Not major but a bit annoying. Any fix for this?
"The App is easy to use, the algorithm also sorts out your song preferences very well. Its GUI is also pretty impressive. The premium version is top notch perfect"
"Very good app to listen to music on, I use it almost daily. Just one thing is that they recently removed the shuffle play button. I hear why they did and it makes sense, but I think it should be added back for personal playlists. Overall great app"
"It's a music app. You can build your library from literally thousands of titles and a multitude of bands across every genre. Small detail is you have to be a paying subscriber to download and play offline. In these times money for a lot of us doesn't come easily, and there are more important things to deal with."
It suits my feelings n emotion the choices n collection of the songs for me.
"This app is amazing, but the new update ruined it, i prefer the penultimate version ( one before this )"
"I use Spotify Premium, and it's great value for money. Spotify has a diverse range of curated playlists, making it easy for you to find the musical genres that you enjoy. It's also clever enough to make playlists designed just for you, based on what you typically listen to. It has never been easier for me to discover new artists and songs that I love!"
This app is quite good i use it when drawing and the playlists are just what i like my only complaint is that the music will start playing randomly i will just be siting on my phone playing a game And it will start playing the previous song i was just listing to other then that its a pretty good app.
Why is the play pause button way off to the left and the skip forward backwards are in the middle? Did someone misplace a 0 and a 1? It looks ridiculous and makes 0 sense why it's not skip pause skip like it used to be. P.S. If you're to cheap to pay to listen to your favorite artists you deserve ads. Expect a premium service for free? LOL
"Great app. I like how easy it is for me to find songs and follow my favourite artists. The UI/UX is beautiful. Four stars because when playing a track in the background and you wish to shuffle the song or repeat it, it can't be done from the notification panel, you'll have to personally open the app again just do do something as trivial as that. It will be great if the repeat and shuffle button shows in the notification panel when playing from the background."
So easy to choose music and is so guick
"Been with spotify for 4 years and I am quite fortunate to have had no issues, so new users come on board the spotify train."
Just love the vibes and ui of this app. Plus the audio quality and music recommendations and the overall user experience it's top tier. Just love this app
I personally love this app but the problem is the shuffle button. You can't click on shuffle unless you bought premium.
"Spotify is the og especially if you have premium, however, I really really wish they switched the controls back around. You know, where the play button is in the middle üòê"
"This app is terrific and it's quite easy to use, but sadly there are a few caveats, sometimes the app appears to be broken, due to it not wanting to play any songs from a different playlist I pick, only works when I force stop the app and clear the cache."
"Spotif is indeed the best, i play all my music on this app, it's really enjoyable, no ads disturbing the music, it's really quite interesting"
Very nice app but please return the enhance button for liked songs
"it works better than okay, but i don't quite like the current application design. Also the part were the artist is featured could use some wikipedia integration..."
Very good and user friendly app. Must download. Satisfied with Spotifyüòä Edit: I still love this app but now there are three ads after almost every song and sometimes the ads are quite inappropriate too. So one star less. Overall a great app.
Getting the song to play is as easy as pressing a play button on your music system. THE SONGS PLAY VERY CLEARLY. ITS SURPRISING. KEEP UP THE GOOD QUALITY WORK
Easy and quick to use. Keeps my job tolerable. Thank you!
A paid user No problem in streaming But new update with play/pause button at left corner isn't a good UI . You are spotify man. Maintain the simplicity.
"Youtube(regular) along with this, gives the best music content . Before I started using this app, I had a horrible time finding songs as the only website/app where I found a good collection of music was YouTube. This still doesn't have all the songs by all the artists(some are country restricted ) but I feel that it still has quite a major collection. Edit: I tried premium and honestly, there isn't much difference in audio quality a... Thankfully, I've only opted for the 3 month free offer..."
It's a great app...easily one of my favourite music apps but it's got some bugs...sometimes ads appear and the dismiss button doesn't work and you have to restart the app and sometimes it consumes a huge load of data and memory than usual...overall it's an awesome app .... would recommend to everyone....!!
It require 5 stars first if we want to listen song and then was amazing app
Best music streaming platform I've used such a clean UI and easy to use I recommend Spotify
Easy to use UI and great music selection.
I quite enjoy Spotify and its wide range of music genres. I also like the option of downloading songs so that I am able to listen to music offline when I am taking a walk.
"With the recent update, the pause/play button didn't need to go on the left side. Other than that, this app is wonderfully neat!"
Love being able to listen to the artists and songs I like and then building a playlist off of that. Nice job
"I absolutely love this app.For sure, it's the best music streaming app there is.From the sleek UI to the crisp and beautiful audio, the app is simply a work of art."
"This is very best platform for listening quick songs. Whole world's songs are available here. Spotify doesn't take big internet data and songs play easily. But, Spotify subscription is very expensive."
Best ever ui .please some less ads. I love it
"Has been great, using this app. Imo, I prefer the older version of the app, I do Not like the updated UI."
I love the app and I even subscribe to premium but the latest updates caused some inconveniences. Why remove the fast scroll function on the right side of the screen. I believe there is no reason to completely remove a very useful function. The experience when browsing without fast scroll is horrible by having to swipe countless times in a playlist with over a thousand songs. The addition of quick access to search is quite nice but it defeats the purpose when it doesn't play the playlist.
"With the latest update, the positioning of the keys in the song interface has changed and it is different from the positioning we are used to. Difference is nice, but this is not... Old version was much nicer and beautiful and also it was easier to use but now it is really useless both in design and functionality. I hope they get it reinstated as soon as possible."
Directs one quickly to music without undergoing many steps
Exceptional experience. Well designed. Great collection of music. Couldn't ask for better.
"The new UI is terrible. The button order during playing is so bad. Every music player ever, has had the previous-play-next order. The play on the left is is a total interface development failure."
It is the best music listening app even if you don't have spotify premium you can fade into songs the audio quality is amazing when I have my airpods on I can hear I guitar on one ear and Other instrument in my Other ear I recommend you buying this.
Genuinely very useful and entertaining app...
"this afternoon I got a glitch where the ui button moved, but it didn't affect the audio quality."
"Very solid app. Recently lots of issues with freezing and not loading albums/playlists at all, requires a force stop to work again."
The latest album art updated design with curved edges is horrifying. Pointed edges looked amazing and flat. Pls roll back.
Love the app. Minus one star because what's with the new button layout?? The pause button is on the left of the screen -.- I like how it was before
My experience with Spotify has been great. I love that you can download and listen offline and the amount of content on this music app is quite expansive.
"Great selection and integrations. Point loss for UI though. Could give users more control and could have more features, especially in the podcast space. Automatic podcast downloads being the first thing that comes to mind."
An exceptional excellent app which has potential to create great history in different applications of musical industry. By improving one of the quality is uninterruptible adds service provision. Thanks. Best of luck for future goals and variable characteristics that would be brought to enhance its genuine authenticity.
"It's the best music streaming service out there, especially if you're a student! The only real downside with this service is that it doesn't have HIFI support that it's competitors like Tidal have. But excluding that, it's a great service that has a very wide selection of artists and a great UI."
"i love spotify but this update is so uglyyyyyy, recently my app has been showing the play button and the skip/replay buttons differently and it bothers me so much because it doesnt rlly make sense to change the basic set up of any music app"
Quick tip: The free version is quite literally unusable
Excellent quality tracks to stream or download. Library quite extensive though can't find every one of my favorites. App seems to crash and corrupt my account leading to my downloaded songs having to be re downloaded every time phone restarts or battery dies which is VERY boring!!!
Perfection. I use this app as a student. I use the free version and I don't know why I don't get the ads. I never saw them in the app. It's an excellent app for a student and also for other age groups. I listen to the music to concentrate in my studies and listen to podcasts too. I think it's the best music app. UI and UX is nice. Till now no complaint. It has many tremendous features for free no other free music app gives you. You can go for it! Satisfied üòå üëç.
Would love this app even more if they came out with a 5x1 widget to fit my screen and maybe song facts on already downloaded songs with no internet required üòâ. Other than that I love it üòÅ
LOVE it! Listen whenever we are on our golf cart (which is quite often)üòäüéÜ
This app was the beater thing I ever had it is good than any other app other apps are fake they think they are 4.8 they are not they play your voice messages dont download them spotify is better as you can listen to good tracks like tranquility(my favourite)by m huncho and you can connect to your xbox
"Great app - just a few problems and I know the answer to one of them; 1) on Apple devices there is a loop button that should be on android that isn't here 2) please don't add songs to small playlists, it can be annoying. 3) add the loop/able to change where in song you're at and able to chose what song is played; HOWEVER these options work when opened while another device such as a computer already has Spotify open. Besides this, great app!!! üòÅ"
You want to add a random music button for them who dont want to search and you can play there top song from 1-100.
Spotify has everything I need but I'm constantly looking away to the phone on the road to change songs because of the hassle with that dam shuffle button
"I love this app so so so much but... my day was ruined when I opened the app and there was a new layout of the buttons, like it's awful I hate it so much I can't describe how awful it is AND it's inconvenient. I just don't know why you would change it in the first place no one said it should change and It just looks ugly like an random website you would find when you're a kid. Idk is just so bad please do something about this"
I love Spotify but.... In the latest update the play button has moved from being between the skip and backskip buttons to be to the left of both of them. This makes me physically sick whenever I look at it I genuinely consider cancelling my subscription.
"Thank you for adding lyrics. Now you are really the best for me !!! P.S. please, put play button in the middle again, it's very inconvenient"
"I'm totally agreeing it's a great app for my swingy moods,,,,,,,,I still remember the day when I didn't find any suitable app for my choice of music ,,,,,,then I got it ,,,,,,,it's provides you variety of music of every genre,,,,,,,and also provides podcasts that helps you to know yourswlf in a better way,,,,,,so download it and enjoy what you love"
"I had a 5 star rating before this, but with the new update the layout on the phone app completely changed. The play/pause button is now on the left side and it's not very convenient. Would appreciate it if it's changed back to the previous layout."
Spotify is the best music and podcast platform web design is easy to use and no hassle payment at a reasonable cost. Keep up the Awesome work!!!üëçüòäüòä
"The functionality of Spotify on devices such as Android Mobile,and Amazon Tv is excellent! there's a wide variety of music for everyone,creating playlists is simple,quick,convenient and multiple versions of the Spotify interface are user friendly tooüëç"
Best app around for building playlists and listening ad free. I've tried them all but Spotify is number one for me.
"Free or Premium, definetly the best music app provinser, with a simple and mest design"
"As a Spotify Free user, this update is very bad. In fact, whenever i create my own playlist and add songs that i love i kept pressing the 2 green arrows, it's shuffle play button won't go off. There is 30 minute clip and they wont play the entire song. Please be good to the users who are encounerting the same issue."
Affordable and has every playlist I searched for. The only set back is I can't put a timer so the music can stop playing after a designated time.
Amazing app! Been using it for almost 2 and a half years. But lately the app has been faking the time for ex: the real time is 1:30 but the song says 0:00 not letting me restart the song very quickly like i used to. Hopefully you fix it soon but other than this its awesome
Top tunes at the touch of a few buttons.
"Great user experience, with varied music catalogue. Perhaps a Hi-fi resolution would be the icing on the cake."
"It's been my streaming platform of choice since 2016 (at least), every update it's just as intuitive, the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because, sometimes, it can reset my downloads out of nowhere, and that can be inconvenient since I'm always on the go and in a need of music, other that, wouldn't change it for anything."
Great options. Intuitive and easy to use
I will be a loyal customer. Very intuitive and easy to navigate.
"Music content and quantities, and UI/Ux is better here. Spotify also gives better recommendations."
I'm enjoying itüëçüëåüëåüëå. I'm not having any discontinuity or noise while hearing Spotify music.
"My stress reliever, my addiction, to be honest this is my true love, at the end I'll be like "" it started in 2019 and Now it's 2050 am 45. And my love is yet not gone for you (spotify) "" üòÇüòÇ The way App is designed is comfortable for me to access the color gives me some kind of warm feel and lot more good things to state ,my only problem is ads"
Please put the pause button back where it belongs...
"Great app, only wish I could use the volume buttons to switch between music Edit: Going several years strong and 700 liked songs with Spotify now, there's really not anything else as good, just wish certain songs were on it, but the local file import feature is awesome for songs not on here. Also, I don't really care about the volume button thing, it's kind of a moot point now lol."
"Once I bought premium, it was just luxury listening. Sheer brilliance in the recommended playlists. I couldn't have paid less for such an experience, magical."
Overall great app. Sometimes however the bottom bar with the buttons disappear and I have to restart the app to get them back.
I am a frequent Spotify USA listener and also a Premium member Your app is exquisite as always A big Thanks to your universally vast music archives and artist selections But as I also subscribed and use the YouTube Music unlimited subscription App it sounds better when you compare the audio quality to Spotify apps music quality Could it be because that app costs more per month?? Anyway Spotify is too good
"Really, it's like all the other ones out there that I've tried, they all have there quirks and sometimes issues but it is what it is. But I do prefer it over Pandora."
"Nice seeing some recent work for android. Swipe to queue, and love the new squiggle progressbar"
"One of the only services left where I can freely create, listen, and build playlists new and old."
Great app. Recent update moved the play/pause button to the left side and I feel likes it's more difficult to use in app now
The GUI needs more developing
"Ive been with Spotify for years and it's always been fine but like with other people it has recently got really buggy. It crashes and freezes quite often now. Other than that I love Spotify and when it works its really user friendly and the music suggestions, discover weekly, release radar etc are 10/10"
When I pause the song with earphone button while the phone is locked the song did not resume when I again press the button
"a few bugs and glitches with the UI, but besides that it's pretty solid for music."
I only have one complaint and that is where did the enhance a playlist button go. I really enjoyed that for expanding my playlists
"I'm a premium member and for a good price, we have so many great features. I pledge my customer loyalty to Google but sadly Youtube music doesn't suit the standards of what music apps should be e.g Spotify."
My requirment of music ls limited to the time of walking and exercise. Plenty of Choice and quality of music is very good.
"Best app experience, the UI is very simple & easy to use. The app runs smooth at all times & up to this far I haven't experienced any glitches."
"I love this app as i can support my favourite artists, although quite disappointed with the sound quality even with ""very high"" setting, as my downloaded mp3 sound better. I'm a non-Japanese that is obsessed with Japanese game music so i'm quite disappointed that some songs are region-locked, especially Ensemble Stars songs."
I love this app! I love the collab playlist feature too. I think somthing that could be added to make it even better would be a way to replay a certain part of a song. I know some people just want to hear a certain part of a song over and over. Maybe hit a button on the menu when you look at a song and adjust the sides of the time bar to decide what portion of the song you wanna hear on loop. I love this app and I go to youtube when I want to hear a part of a song on loop.
Enjoy your music an love hearing threw my Bundy rum sounds cube as sounds even better but finding the are more ads then what I l sure on a hr maybe 3 hrs to many ads even thou you skip but you only get 6 skips. Ok thank you for your time and consideration hopefully you mite send me a prize or something ahhh cheers stay Cool loses the ads ore music video ECT but alot of ads usenin up my data quick ummm but u love your selection of music to get down and boogie and dancing and you're singing the i
"I used to listen for Music through YouTube apps for almost whole day before I met this app, when I moved to here, I got some great experience from UX and UI inside this app, everything's great and I believe it could beaten Apple Music (iTunes) popularity becaused what we found in here was so close to what we felt in Apple Music apps (In listening musics experience, UI and UX too) eventough wasn't the best in his line but at least we could find the same between both..."
"I don't like music, but, I do like podcasts at times, so for that it's good. 'Queuing up' audios is a conveniant feature. Nothing much to say, very good app that's all. :D Oh and the recommendations are precise according to one's taste."
"It is a great app to listen to music but what would be better,i suggest they would add the just play one song or play the whole playlist button on the notification bar."
Besides the ads....I'm quite happy with this app considering it is a free one.
"This app is good but it takes a while to get used to it.I've been using for few years and I had to find out why it suddenly stopped playing my playlist in order and started playing random tracks.It quite often goes off on its own and plays tracks not chosen by me,This in the settings somewhere took me ages to find it.There are other numerous odd things it does on its own.Which can be quite annoying."
"Really good for casual listeners , one of the best features and the feature to difficult ui ratio is also kinda high so yeah it's the best"
"Really good collections, you can find all trending tracks and also variety of genres to suit your mood, am really loving it"
"Honestly wish there was more variety of advertisements. I dont wanna be hearing the same ad after trying to sleep with my playlist on, but I guess its supposed to be annoying so we can buy premiumüò≠ also sometimes the play/pause buttons disapppear from my lock screen and my playlist randomly pauses??"
Has all the songs you can ever want / think of. You can comolie your own personal playlists or follow playlists that suit your music taste. Good music app 10/10
"Hi, I'm having a little bit of an issue, why does my next, pause, button keep disappearing? It's frustrating a little bit. And this just started like a few weeks ago, before it never happened! What's going on with this? Thanks in advance."
"App keeps freezing and shows ""no internet connection"" in the recent update despite full wifi connection. This is a bug. It leads to thumbnails of the albums songs playlists not being displayed. I need to quit spotify, clear recent apps and reopen spotify several times to fix the issue. The audio also stop playing randomly."
I'm new to Spotify and only just became a premium member so I'm still going off of my three month trial but already looking forward to my first payment. Everything I have heard about Spotify is true ! The designers and creators of this app know their stuff and must love music themselves. Cheers to the designers of Spotify I am a very happy Spotify customer and definitely won't be cancelling my sevice for a very long time if at all. Thanks to the team for creating one of the best music apps ever!
"Filter for playlist should be more accessible. Now just on the top, there must be a button or something to acces from anywhere you are on the playlist."
"Been a user since 2010 beta when they were really new and it still feels fresh, fast and expanding. It needs a light/dark-mode for PC, better implementation off messaging, more lyrics, UI Themes or customizable layouts with more visualisations... so it is pretty chunky in file size /cpu usage for being a media player buffering from a connection but..so there is still room for improvements"
This is actually cool but the repeat button is gone
Ive been using this app for quite a few years and it is amazing. I use it everyday at work.
"I love Spotify..it delivers on what it says it delivers on.No problems there..my only problem with it though is why the app is not allowed to run in background if you remove it from your recent apps..i mean i used to use deezer before and it worked seamlessly like that, no issues..i just want to be able to choose music i want to listen to and then listen to it without having to not mistakenly remove it from my recents.. I'm used to do that with all my apps and so it ruins the experience for me"
My favorite music app by far. One of the very few subscriptions that I enjoy paying. I've literally convinced my whole household of it's glory. Spotify's interface is probably one of the most intelligent designs I've had the pleasure to toggle with. I love you Spotify. I truly do. I use this app all day long and all night. It is the digital Adderall to my all to real ADHD.
Best music platform I've used. Thats not saying much tho. The only thing I hate is one cant thumbs DOWN a song to remove it quickly. Wish they would add that
"The quick access banner on my notification panel is not there anymore. I have to find the app, open it and then change/pause the song. what happened?"
This app is quick and easy to use if you understand... But this is one of the best music apps I know in my opinion...keep on with the lovely apps üëå
Sometimes it just stops playing after 20 to 30 minutes and I have to press play again....and....sometimes the double bar pause or stop button is not shown. Otherwise happy.
Absolutely brilliant. Never had problems with it. Quick and easy to use. Love the playlists option where you can make your own. Pay for the premium. Best ¬£10 a month I spend for no adverts.
"As a premium user, I can't comment on the ads since I don't get any. The daily mixes have gotten a lot better. Newer features like finding music from lyrics on search bar are actually helpful and intuitive. It would be better if it had different audio options like 8D. Also they do not have ALL songs like yt which could be annoying."
Good music streaming service with user-friendly UI. Not encounter any bug so far...so i gave 5 stars for now.
My absolute favorite app and most used app that's worth every penny for the membership cost! I use Spotify every single day and love how it recommends and creates mixes of songs designed just for you. My favorite feature that came through a couple updates back shows the song lyrics if you click on them while it's playing and I'm so grateful for this feature!! Love Spotify and will be a lifelong customer!
Just got Spotify this past weekend and so far I have no complaint. Only wish that in your Playlist near the top there was a shuffle button. It would make playback easier than having to find the shuffle when you select a song. Not a deal breaker but still would make it easier
UI is lo minimal and easy to use. Should give option to download songs individually.
Absolutely great service just wish it was a little bit more predictive and intuitive like my YouTube music
Just an fantastically designed app. Really well done.
Great selection with amazing Playlist builds have noticed however previously available comtent is no longer viewable or not easily found
Play button is just a white circle in dark mode. No download option per song. Podcast should have a separate section instead of mixing between songs in homepage.
"I do love Spotify! Even pay for no ads, some days the app is finicky but gets resolved pretty quickly so no complaints here üëç"
"This is the best music streaming app of √†ll time. Fantastic UI is there. Everything is great. But you can make downloading songs available for the free version, but I know it is the reason for subscription but you can make it."
"great option, need a military or veteran discount like students get. still hard to find my podcasts, not very intuitive"
Best music streaming platform. I love how it organizes my favorite tracks in my own personal category Spotify has got to be the best music streaming platform ever. Especially now that they sync with Samsung music on Samsung devices you won't have drag of going to download music on other apps on Play store but I wish that they could have made a play next button on listening to offline music.
"Usually great, but the enhance button will sometimes glitch out and shorten the playlist as well as recommend already added songs"
The music is amazing there's a free and when I mean free I mean FREE 15 day without adds which I love but there's ads after there very quick tho so if you like music I would recommend
Best steaming service by far. Only two small complaints with the UI. Only complaint is the settings menu. It's hard to find and can only be accessed from the main screen instead of from everywhere
"I had issues with my app on my phone so I emailed and it was fixed so quickly, same day I emailed. Great customer service :)"
"""SEE UPDATE"" Thank you for fixing this application it is better than the previous 3 updates. It is back working near on perfectly. Great looking UI, nice, clean,, easy to navigate with probably the most extensive library of music from any provider. *UPDATE* downgraded to 1 star from 5 as album art is missing from all of the downloaded albums. *UPDATE* cleared cache and uninstalled and installed fresh and everything appears to be working okay again, fingers crossed that it retains the album art."
"Excellent music app, the new design finally works flawlessly and am having 0 problems with it. Thank you!"
"Sometimes, the play button doesn't appear after I've clicked a song. The song plays, but I can't pause, skip, or repeat it. I have to exit the app then open it again for the buttons to appear. Please fix this! Aside from that, the features all work well."
Best streaming platform for music lovers with premium UI
"I'm giving it 4 stars, not 5, only for 1 reason. You can't select multiple songs at once to move in or out of a playlist, which means if you wanna build a playlist, it takes a lot longer than it should. It should be the same way your Gallery works, how you can tap and hold to move many pics / files at once. Other than that, spotify is awesome. Having millions of songs at your fingertips for the price of 2 starbucks coffees a month? Worth it =)"
"The sound world in palm of your hand. Quick, objective, and Incredible."
This app is actually good so far and I'm new I started 2 or 4 days ago and so far it's doing great but there is a issue there is not a speed up button so I can speed it up I would love to speed up the music I'm hearing .the audio is pretty good and if your wondering Spotify let's you listen while offline unlike YouTube music.
"There's a reason why it's one of the best music streaming apps but the UI is too... boring, to me. Basically the experience is not all that. We also need individual downloads, especially with albums. I can't always like every song in an album."
"Quite convenient,and global in tast of music and sounds"
The app is great. I only hate it when the queuing thing doesn't work.
"Good quality audio files ! To give you all round experience of music , selection of music is quite decent , but some genres needs more content!"
"Brilliant, intuitive and smooth"
"All the music I want at the press of a button or two. It's brilliant, thanks."
"The pausing issue that started a month ago seems to be resolved in the past week, as well as the disappearing player controls. Thanks to the support staff for the quick replies to my email and for results that I could see."
"The app is quite good, but I don't know why the songs are downloaded everytime I open the app, though I have premium. It must be downloaded one time only, so that I can listen them anytime. That's why I have listen them online, despite having premium account."
Love the library you can build and the depth of choices but miss Neil and Joni
Intuitive to my musical taste. Easy to use. Simply the best!
love itt maybe cut the ads for free or have a skip button for ads like how youtube music has and your rates probably will go even higher no disrespect by the way <33
"Spotify is my favourite music app. loads of wonderful music of course plus: podcasts, artist pages, song lyrics, easy to use search explore function, play-lists, etc, all lead to a wonderful experience. What really sets Spotify above the other apps though is it's layout, very easy to use and very nice design. I would have given the app 5‚≠ês because i really love it but Spotify loses a star for how it does ads. 15/30 second ad every 15/20 min. or 1, 1 minute video for 30 mins music, would be good."
"If you streaming audio to WiFi loudspeakers, the app itself sometimes can't manage the volume. Usually it requires app restart to see the volume for remote speaker. Another annoying thing are podcasts. At the moment it's virtually impossible to find out podcasts by given language. One more thing, recently observed bug when Spotify is playing something but there's no play menu inside the application, it just literally vanishing from the app. Only application restart solving this."
"I love the app. Good user experience but i have a concern. I would have loved a shuffle button at the top when i open 'My Library' so i can shuffle songs including playlists, albums and downloaded songs altogether. Sometimes i like to listen to songs from different genre while carrying out a task. Doesnt have to be necessarily songs that have same sound. If that's done it will be a 5star for me. Great job guys."
"The episode playing never shows, it's always a previous episode you've listened to and never updates. Spotify also stops playing constantly, ruins the episode. I'm going back to reliable podcast addict app. Edit: things have worked fine the past year, just need to keep updating."
Has all my music selection. Always on in my car or on my Alexa. Some glitches where the play and next button dissappear. Also can't use it on my galaxy watch which is disappointing as it never connects.
"I love this app. It gives great music and I love that you can see some playlist others design. And the fact that you can find more music like the music you like. Also, I can exit the app while listening and that's what makes me appeciate this app. Also the ads are a good amount reasonable and also there are plans without ads.üòÖ‚úåÔ∏èüèæ"
Been using this from 2019.. It's the best music streaming app.. the UI is user friendly both mobile and PC.. only complain is ad but if you have premium then all sorted!
"Love it but I've been noticing that songs I've previously liked are suddenly not in my liked songs and I have to find them again. I just added a new song this morning and noticed tonight that it is not there anymore and had to find it again, I think that's the quickest a song has ever disappeared."
When I press add song I used to have a little button where if I pressed it I could listen to the song for a while but now it's gone please add it back and the equalizer
It's really good the ads are alittle unbareable sometimes but I'm having issues usally you can loop songs and anonymous shuffle playlist on spotify for samsung smart tv but when I click loop on my samsung tv it's not letting me loop at all but the buttons are still there can I get any help to solve this?
"Finally! An app that has all my music, and an Uncluttered, Elegant GUI. Well worth a few c3nts a day."
c'est tr√®s sympa et j'aime apprendre une chanson intitul√©e blue eyes c'est TR√àS sympa donc c'est pourquoi je lui ai donn√© 5 d√©parts :) (it is very nice and i like to leson to a song called blue eyes is VERY nice so thats why i gave it a 5 starts:))
Great. Not impressed with ads built in to podcasts though. I pay premium to avoid these intervals
"I love Spotify it allows me to listen to all different types of music to suit my mood or vibe each day. I'm constantly finding songs I enjoy listening to from Spotifys recommendations & play list, made just for me I then add them to my own play list."
"It has some bugs, like for example the music button dissapears but the music goes on. Besides that, really good."
Love spotify! Very intuitive algorithm.
"Spotify is the best app ever! It made me thankful for living in this era of time. I really love how the algorithm knows which genre and mood to choose for me based on only one song I search for! I love the Daily Mixes and the recommendations, the huge number of playlists and categories, the design and user experience, and a lot more features. Thank you for this"
"i love this app, the automatic playlists based on your listening history ,music recommendations so so user intuitive"
"Very good intuitive selection of similar music based on listening habits. Easy to use, easy to explore."
I still can't play some songs even though I paid for. Premuim please give some response!!
"From my point of view.. This app is awesome... Well maintained UI, dark theme, variety of songs, millions of playlist and more... Can try an awesome app for music, soundtracks, podcasts and more... One thing which is missing is we can't download songs. Rest is fine"
Some times spotify will stop playing. Also will not show the play or pause button
I love ‚ù§Ô∏è this app a lot because it has a best collection it has a collection of all song around the world and recommendations of this app is superb it makes perfect blend of your favourite beats I use this app mostly than other social media apps 'cause of its perfect UI than other music apps I personally think that the Spotify is the best platform for streaming online songs sometimes for free accounts adds irritates the most but In-spite of this It match with my all expectations perfectly.
"Just a few suggestions that i am pretty sure are very easy to implement in the app as i am a sorta dev myself too. 1)Show me which song is going to be played next. 2)Add functionality to make playlist groups so that its a bit easy to organize many playlists 3)Add button to shuffle playlist the random play button next to play/pause isn't actually completely random from what i know after all this time, instead i guess maybe it just picks the best songs to play first"
"The horrible, invasive and insidious power of ads. I never understood how tranquil listening to podcasts was until these tv like ads now invade your senses. Typical ads, they are done in such a way to provoke your senses, even insult them with annoying, disingenuous voices that linger long after the ad is over. The reason is so you'll remember the ad, they make an absolute prostitution of your attention. Will this be like YouTube soon where extreme censorship came down on all content?"
"Great app, especially on PC because there's less ads. On Mobile it's not bad either, the 30-Minute Ad-Free Video that you get certainly makes it better and more bearable. Hopefully in the future once I get a steady job I will get myself that sweet, juicy premium that I've been wanting to get."
"Spotify has a extensive music library. Chances are if you want they have it . But there mobile set up is poor for any kind of customizing, it's extremely difficult to build a play list if you have a lot of music to add , and no way to simply remove a song from your Playlist. Makes it very difficult to build your play list if you plan on listening to any music while your offline or out of service areas."
Bestest app for all the songs It requires less internet speed it also works on that It gives the best sound quality I prefer you to plzz download it nd use it then plzz give us a good review
"Great experience, just built and downloaded my first playlist after subscribing for my 3 month premium free access."
"Spotify is my only go to when listening to music at home, away and in the car. The songs that you select after my list is finished is a great idea as quite a few I have added to my list."
"Intuitive app, without many ads and the original podcasts are very good"
"I've been using premium for 2 years now, and right now the app is better than ever. All the compact design, easy to navigate functions, I just love to use Spotify."
"Great app but recently it will not play sometimes. I press the play button and nothing happens, or a song or podcast will play but the controls are not visible just the podcast or song list. Can't turn it off unless I shut off the app. This is happening more."
"Its quite lovely, paid subscriber for over ten years. Did not disappoint."
Can't use any other app now that I've used Spotify. Like it's UI. The one thing I wish it had was it's previous group session. The newer remote only group session isn't working well.
I've had Spotify for 3 years now and I love it. Awhile back I had some issues with the web player version of it but after a time of little to no use from the app it fixed itself and now works wonderfully and gives me everything I need at the click of a button.
"""...loading more music than Pandora"" and you weren't kidding! Lyrics to almost every song at least that I've noticed little video background to each song best artist backgrounds and bios you just can't get any more informative and better than this I've learned so much things about music and songs I've loved that I never would have known like certain guitarists and people collaborating with this person to create this song on this album never would have known..."
"A very solid music streaming app, fairly easy to use, but it's most defining feature for me is its ability to automatically create playlists using the music you listen to. The playlists will have new music suited to your tastes and music you already love! Dropped a star as the consistently rotating home screen means sometimes you cannot find something you are looking for that was open last tike you opened it."
"Good app,would recommend,but he Spotify connect feature and the UI is a little buggy"
"Recent update caused issues. App would simply stop playing, and play, skip, etc buttons vanished. All fixed. Re-reviewed."
Excellent music app that builds a Playlist based on what you like. Love that feature! üëç
"It has been quite eventful, it has an efficient algorithm."
Love the app but I can't figure out how to turn off shuffle? üòï I don't see a button to press and it's confusing- I probably am just dumb Edit: I Uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it still didn't work- I saw stuff saying that should work Edit 2: I made a new account and it worked!
love the app !! but theres an issue. when i go to add my songs to my playlist. its says 'add songs' i press on it but theres no play button near the songs i wanna add... what if i like that song... youve just removed a feature that i like about this stupid app üíÄ
"Haven't gone the whole hog with spottify yet they have a really great range of music, that suits my appetite .. top marks üôÇ"
Good app wish wash cheaper paid for premium for quite awhile got bored with it lol
Highly recommended from the UI to the AI Amazing recommendations of songs And UI is easy to use and feels modern
Getting use to hunting for the delete que button and apparently there is none!
Gui nice. Good menus. Usually works. Stop broadcast to my radio app for Spotify. But 5 stars nonetheless.
Lately the app has been very buggy and the pause/play bar at the bottom disappears and I have to restart the app to pause or skip to the next song. I hope this issue can be promptly resolved as it is quite frustrating for an app I spend a lot of time using.
"Hey, great app, been using it for many many years, using premium account and so far I was quite happy with the service. But recent bugs are really annoying, I cant check the song that is playing and today music started to stop playing for no reason dozens of times during day. Please! Fix it asap."
What's going on with the app? You can't pause or start music if it's playing. Just rollback to previous build lol
"For those using Samsung phones and the play button won't show up, close out the app and clear its cache then open it up. The play button should pop up again, this worked for me and I hope it works for those who stumble upon this!"
Best app .. song you can choose according to your mood ! And can save them also ! Required less data
"You guys at Spotify are great! You have made Spotify irresistible; it is now the greatest streaming service indeed! Device music playback, lyrics, beautiful UI etc it's beautiful!"
"This app is incredible! I've tried so many music apps, but trust me, I was not satisfied with any of them except this one. Most of the times, I wouldn't like it's UI and or it will be a paid app. But Spotify has the best UI and collection of songs and most importantly, the best podcasts which no other app offers. Disadvantages: 1) Sometimes the ads are too annoying. 2) It consumes a good amount of storage."
Latest update is really buggy on Android. It keeps disconnecting and it doesnt show on a locked screen quite often. Spotify is the best music streaming app out there
"Would give 3 stars, if not for my history with this app. Please get it back to shape. Some design decisions are hard to understand, some technical aspects reminds rather an alpha version than long developed mature application. Let me give you 5 stars back again."
"Like a lot of other reviewers, I've been pretty happy with the app, however the recent glitches where the music won't stop playing & the now playing tab keeps disappearing is quickly getting to be more trouble than it's worth. I've had to force stop the app at least half a dozen times just today. Please fix these issues."
"Long time user but the last update, April 2022, introduced a super annoying bug. I can't see/pause/ff the song being played until I restart. Hopefully this gets resolved quickly."
Quick and easy I just love the classics
"I'm always able to find whatever song I want at the moment, no matter how obscure, and Spotify makes it really easy to build my own playlist."
I listen to music all day every day and this gets the job done with an easy to use UI and sharing with friends.
"Had to install an earlier version, since discover weekly stopped allowing me to select a song, and is requiring me to shuffle. Besides that and the amount of ads, not a bad music app"
"Easy , applicable & friendly to newcomers....great app to build up your vibes"
"I'd give 5 stars but the ""play"" button & track keeps disappearing so I can't pause or change the song. I have to restart my phone. Otherwise, I love Spotify! I also wish the musicians got better compensation üôÇ"
"Love the app, I have used it for years but recently the mini player within the has disappeared and no really way to see what's playing,pause or skip tracks and I'm also have the problem of having to close down all apps when disconnecting aux from car because music keeps playing on phone. Spotify is this a bug from recent update or ......?"
"Need a little development like the app is so boring and if you want some advice on the design Contact me I will do it for for 10$ and if you implement it I want 1500$, deal? Is fun you know."
I download this some week ago it's good but recently there are times that whenever I play a song the panel where it has the play and all those buttons could not be seen. Even in the notification box you won't see the song playing even though it's playing. Hope this gets fixed soon.
"A bit buggy on mobile (Android 12 One UI 4.1), sometimes controller doesn't show what's actually playing, in app player may not show although a song is playing. These are quite big bugs, but I still give 4 stars. Patch it and you'll get 5 from me :)."
"Android users quick fix! Downgrade your application to an older version. Uninstall application, download SDK from oficial Spotify website and reinstall the app from SDK, don't forget to stop updating the app afterwards!!!"
I have been using spotify for years I love it. One change I would like is a second like button that will not automaticaly add the song to a play list. Then spotify could make me better playlists without my main favorites growing so large.
Best musicentertainment streaming platform out there! You can really train the algorithm to suit your tastes ave you'll never run out of new music too listen to free or premium.
"I find this app quite good. I use it almost on a daily basis, and is very enjoyable. And for a very cheap price you can upgrade to premium and get no adds. Even with ads, it is still very enjoyable, and I highly recommend it."
Best music streaming service out there IMO. The app is very easy to use. Everything is very smooth and fluid. The playlists are pretty accurate most of the time. Sound quality its excellent. A paid subscription makes the experience even better.
"Hi Spotify, Lately when I play a music in Spotify app, my play bar doesn't displayed. This issue is oftenly happens. I have to kill the app and open again to resolve it. This is annoying. I'm using Samsung Galaxy A52 with One UI 4.1."
quickly fixed the bugs brought on by the latest update after being notified! back to being an easy to use app.
"Its such a wonderful experience to have spotify ive tried other apps. But this is the best one yet ive had this account now for 5+years and love it . only small request, when weekly discovery comes out, if we have already hit the dont like button please dont send those same songs again maybe by different artists ok but the same song and artist, that does get old."
It can create playlist and add downloaded songs to playlists and there is a button where you get free premium no credit card needed for 4 months
"Superb awesome music streaming App available in the whole world! Everything works flawlessly, UI is superb and it's dark feels so much better than other apps. I can listen to music and podcasts online/offline I just need canvas feature and 2FA authentication sign-in for this. Would be great."
"Nice app üëç I would say best ever UI ever scene, even that concept of advertisement between songs are not so creepy as YouTube ‚ò∫Ô∏è, they are funny as well. Thanks Spotify for providing a great service from yours side."
"I cannot spend a single day without Spotify. I do not buy Premium subscriptions for anything, but I promise you that Spotify Premium is not a luxury, but a necessity. I will always recommend using Spotify, it is the best app for people who have music running in their blood."
Really the best app for listening to music . Totally enjoy my playlists where the songs are picked for me.The plans are somewhat feels satisfying .The UI is so simplistic and usually there are no or close to very few ads in this app
"Just download the app and it's great , it doesn't use a lot of data. I can't just find the download button."
"Terrible UI update, now it's super messy and unorganized. Hate."
I have an android so I used YouTube music but when I found out Spotify doesn't require money I rushed to sign in unlike YouTube music when I turn on off my phone it still works
Over time I have asked for some quite unusual music. It has played it every time. Never let me down.
Lol music quality is good but the ads are just kinda annoying and when im sleeping and listening to Spotify the ads are just kinda really annoying in my phone theres no repeat for the song since i always like my music in repeat for other i dont know i guess they have the repeat button but i dont have the repeat song button so yeah i only hibe it 4 stars.
"Updated 04/14/2022: The app is overall good but recent updates over the past year have made it less stable on my galaxy S7, and man their podcast UI is pretty mediocre compared to castbox Original post: [5 stars] It's good"
"Hey spotify, i can't express how I'm in love with spotify but still you can add features like 10sec seek time but double tapping the album posters on both the sides. And also change the widget UI."
"UI is a mess at the moment, does not show which song is playing and gets stuck on a song. Pretty frustrating."
Wish they don't get rid of the dislike button but still like the app as a whole.
"I love this app so much! But there's 1 thing I need to complain, I have Spotify installed on my phone and tablet. In my tablet I can edit the songs order in a playlist but in my phone, I don't see the option to edit the song order, why is that? I'm going to sell my tablet and I'm afraid I can't arrange the songs order anymore, plus I don't have a PC or Laptop to do so. Maybe kindly add an arrange button on my phone too? That would be great, thank you."
"I have been using Spotify for a few years now and have been pleased with the overall user experience and interface. I love that not only can find a variety of podcasts and music, Spotify recommends similar podcast topics and songs based on what I listen to, which only makes driving even more enjoyable. I also appreciate that I can be listening to something on my phone and then switch on my laptop / Smart TV and continue listening there. Great Job, Spotify! üíö"
Yooo! the pause button is bugged and and when i get on the app it the play bar at the bottom doesn't show as if im not listening to anything.
"The app used to be great but recent updates have caused issues with connectivity and playback buttons dissappearing! I now have to close the app to stop music. Wonderful. Surprising though, that there are no issues with billing whatsoever!"
"Love the content and library available. I've been using it for years but recently it's quite buggy - my song just stop playing after minutes, or the playing bar is missing, which disable me from pausing the song."
One big problem right now is I can't see the player button in my app. So I play music by click on song and I can't see the button for stop/play music or skip. Why is that?
"Needs an update, the bar at the bottom which shows what's playing, together with buttons like play/pause, skip keeps disappearing, so I have to do a ""force stop"". Also can you please ensure I can access my downloads when I'm offline? That's surely the point of downloading them."
"For me, spotify is the best streaming platform for people who have other things to do on their phone but still want to listen to music. This app has been with me for aslong as i can remember and you dont need premium to use it while using other apps. Though it is quite a bit laggy, In my pc, it repeats the first 6 seconds of a song over and over, and you have to restart the song inorder to play the song. Overall great app though"
"Great app of course, but there's a new bug since about a week. The play bar at the bottom disappears, or never even appears at all. Same with the music card in my notification shade (BT buttons then don't work either). Music does play and there is no lag, but if i want to skip a song I have to clear the app about once or twice, only to lose it again after some half hour. OP7pro It even begins to quit around twice a day during studying, needing me to restart the app"
Would be 5 stars but 4 because I cant find a few songs which sucks... however a 5 for overall user experience and quality.
"Very well arranged , suitable for all ages , Choice And Music."
Great UI. I like how I can finally have all my favourite songs in one place regardless of when it came out
"The latest release it's causing a bug on my Samsung M31. Everytime I use Spotify and play a song, the ""window"" containing play/pause button (and where I can click to open lyrics) disappear. I've already tried to clear data, cache and even reinstall the app, without success. Sorry if anything looks confuse, still improving my English. Thanks from Brazil. ( I will change the 1-star when this is properly solved )"
Spotify premium (duo) suits all my needs.
"Lyrics' line spacing after the last update became too large, previous one was giving a prettier look to the lyrics section. I understand the purpose (Make it easier to distinguish between lines while reading, maybe), but I suggest to only apply this large line spacing when there is a back to line (in the lyrics source) or whatever it's called. Now, there is that large space even when it's the same line but split in two due to space constraint."
"The songs, sound quality and the UI are all great....but the ads, the ads were the issue because of which I shifted from gaana....but it started here as well....better than gaana yeah but still to many ads...and just a suggestion, u should add an option to update blends instantly....if the ads are reduced this is the greatest songs app"
"The app is user friend, fantastic ui look and great user experience, üëåüèø"
"it's worth it to pay for premium honestly. and there are ton of different plans for different situations. It's probably the best streaming app out there. it has quite a lot of bugs, especially with Bluetooth but usually just restarting the app fixes it so it's not really an issue. Some albums went missing for some reason (WHAT. -Bo burnham for example) but it came back, so I don't have reason to complain."
Love this app but it's bugging out the last month or so. It randomly won't show the play bar and I have to force stop and the open (at least once a day) and it also just randomly stops playing when I'm connected to by earbuds (not quite as often but it's still annoying). Please fix!
Everything is really good...ü•∞ Best app for all the songs to hear and that too according to ur mood..ü§©But oy reason to rate 4‚òÖ is IT IS A HELL OF ADS WHICH MAYBE MORE THAN 2 TO 3 MINUTES... THIS MAINLY RUINS OUR MOOD AND EXCITEMENT OF HEARING SONGS..üòëüò∂HOPE THIS WILL BE FIXED SOON... BUT ALWAYS A SPOTIFIAN..üòÅüòâ
Been using the app for a while now and up until i got a new phone Samsung s22 it was fine but now i keep loosing the buttons to play the music and csn only get them back by restarting the phone. Is this a known or new bug. Other wise the app is great .
"I would have given it 5 ,but there's every other day that the app just keeps playing none stop and it doesn't show me the pause button at all. For example the past 2 days. It's very annoying"
"I use to love this app, but that's been ruined,can't even get my phone to connect to my old account"
"Genuinely love this app. Want to give it 5 stars. But it's just that the auto play isn't as good as YouTube music. It repeats the song if I search for something and play it. Apart from that, even algorithm for playlist creation is awesome."
So things have changed. The ui is way better there are some bugs that need to be fixed. But the app is working better
"I wish the system was more fluid and smooth like IOS swiping down on a song to move on to other things like finding new songs, playlists, etc. Other than that, its almost perfect UPDATE: THEY FINALLY DID IT. FIVE STARS"
"Right now it keeps crashing and the play and pause buttons keeps disappearing, super annoying"
"Mostly good, a lot of wifi connection issues, seems to have trouble connecting to the internet over wifi at times, will have to switch to data to use. ... Connection issues seem to have resolved. However the player (now playing+ controls) seems to have disappeared from the UI. Can still play, but no longer see the now playing interface on the app, nor in my task drawer."
"Not flawless, every update brings annoying bugs. For some goddamn reason they want to change the ui."
I love Spotify! It has all the songs I will probably ever listen to. The UI is wonderful and easy to maneuver around.
"Hello, I noticed the app, whenever I paused it, then will try to play it again, the play button or recently playing is gone"
I couldn't process my payment with DANA because of the bad UI. Didn't the developer teams do a testing before they released this version of Spotify? Didn't they realize that users couldn't even input the PIN to confirm the payment because the buttons were so large (they didn't fit my mobile screen!) and I couldn't scroll/swipe it..? How am I suppose to confirm my premium payment??
The music options are pretty much endless when it comes to Spotify. It is only $10 a month for unlimited streaming but the free version is also nice. I love the design and the overall look of the app. It is simple and easy to manage my playlists and podcasts as well.
"Spotify finally listened and added swipe to queue on Android. Finally! I'm not the biggest fan of how it looks, I preferred the slightly blocky design, but the fact that swipe to queue is now a thing makes it all good."
Well organized intuitive interface.
"ORIGINAL 2/2022: New design is nice, but as someone with a constantly growing collection of about 2,700 liked songs, I hate how the grabber on the scrollbar was removed. It now takes forever to scroll through that long list just to pick the song I want. If you could bring that back, I'll change this to 5 stars üòä EDIT 11/4/2022: It's back, thanks! üòÅ"
The app is good like real good but it would be nicer if I can the language of the lyrics provided......like a translate button
"Exceptional. Been With Spotify For Years. Love That They Don't Up Their Charges Once You Subscribe To Premium. As A Musician & A Person That Treats Music Like It's A My Pulse. Spotify Gets Invested In Their Subscribers, Whether It's From ""Summer Rewind"",""Most Listened To Artist"" To ""A Quick Mix Of Songs You Forgot"". 5 Stars & Highly Recommended."
The app is good. The design is cool. The algorithms for selecting similar music are great. But I'm not particularly a fan of advertising.
"Great but when I stream over wifi to my Google nest, the app just starts skipping songs and then will only play 9 seconds of a song and be quite after a while. Doesn't do this on Bluetooth or through my phone. Please fix this!"
It's the best music app I have ever used it has everything you name it they got it I am I am an old school rocker they got all my high school favorites quiet riot wasp AC/DC Judas priest just to name a few
They should make this app adv free. Sometimes it just annoys the mood. Music shouldn't interfere buisness it should be free for everyone.
"I love spotify so much, but the last two days I haven't been able to skip a song like a normally can. The play/pause buttons and the skip forward backwards buttons are just not appearing."
"This is a great app but I am facing a problem where everytime I dont play a music 4 a while n when I pressed the play button the numbers that shows how long the song is doesnt move n when is finished it doesnt shows the picture of the next song, it just shows the same picture of the song I just played pls fix this."
i love it the only thing i would fix is spotify emailing me about there preuim... Otherwise it is AWSEOME i think it is awseome cuz all the songs are FREE :) if u are thinking of getting spotify plzzzzz follow me at _Isabelle_Sandler_ Thxssss
"The following review is coming from a hardcore audiophile. I've been using Spotify for the last 2 years but didn't get the premium since I believed it was too expensive for just listening to audio. Many times I had thought of switching to other music apps, but once you go Spotify you won't go back. No other music app can hold a candle to Spotify in terms of UI, recommendations and music stock. Eventually I subscribed to the student premium using my stipend money. I haven't regretted it since."
Spotify isn't playing any of my songs the timer is stuck at 0:00 but it is showing that the play button is on but no sounds are coming I have tried clearing cache reinstalling i have enough space but nothing is working worst app.
"Love the endless selection of all my favorites, especially when traveling. Navigate to the right corner to the ‚Äúlyrics button‚Äù and select if you want to enable Lyrics. Pretty cool feature üëçüèø"
The UI experience is very exceptional
"awesome app. I have the premium version which I buy every month. There is one thing that bothers me. When I'm playing my playlist on shuffle, and I hear a song I like, but I hit the button to go to the next song by accident. So I click the back button to go to the previous song, but it doesn't let me..."
"Almost always has the music I want, I enjoy the playlists created for me. The free version is okay as long as you have a stable connection. Had to unsubscribe for a bit due to financial reasons and the cancellation process was effortless and quick. All in all it's a great application and I will continue using it. It works well on my phone and PC."
"A music platform that is so extensive you'll never be bored; its got something everyone. Filled with the old, new and yet to be discovered diamonds in the rough. The muisc just goes on and on."
"The BEST music streaming service. The UX is on point. I tried Apple music and Deezer, and always keep coming back."
"I like that I can press the power button to switch of the screen, and the podcasts still play even though I don't use the premium version."
"Great app I am very pleased,pls don't make any changes, bcos if you do you will ruin this wonderful experience I have right now. This app deserves 5 stars from me great job"
"I love Spotify... For the most part. The only downfall, in my opinion, is the fact that Spotify on Android Auto is missing some features. Please add the ability to queue songs on Android auto (through voice commands, and a button on the screen), and please also add the ability to search for songs (using an on screen keyboard, not only voice commands)."
Spotify displays lyrics for most songs that accurately match up with the vocals. High audio quality and smooth UI.
Still the largest selection of music. Opens quickly with 0 bugs or lag.
"wish there was an easier way to add songs from a playlist or queue into another playlist on mobile, for example if swiping right adds a song to the queue, swiping left could open up the add to playlist menu. would be quicker than the three dots menu the app's got now."
"I love that you can make a playlist, and hit the enhance button, and it pops up a bunch of new music like the songs on that playlist. I love finding new music all the time, and i feel like spotify helps with that. so much to chose from."
"Best audio quality, nice collection, simple and great UI, but some of the international artists are not available for india thats why I gave it 4 stars. But now its worthy for 5 Stars. Please launch Spotify HiFi in India."
"I've had Spotify since 2016 and I upgraded to Spotify Premium in 2020 and I honestly enjoy the app. Yes there are the obvious downsides yet all apps have pros and cons to them. I really enjoy not being hounded by ads every two-three songs and I can actually play what I want, despite a few of my favorite songs being unavailable to listen to I still find the vast amount of choices to be enjoyable. The new UI is easy to use and it doesn't take a lot of time to get yourself set up I enjoy Spotify"
This app is really neat! One recommendation for it would be to add a search button just so that you can have a wider variety of music and podcasts in the watch app. Thanks!
"Its a great app I guess? Just one problem though... THE ADS. Well I mean like ads are used for money im not that dumb. But imagine this, you're jamming to a playlist and suddenly ADS. Thats quite annoying isnt it? I think the devs should try to do something about it (Not removing ad features) Other then ads problem its a great app. (Im not a premium guy and dont want to pay monthly"
Best music player! What would make it better?: 1) swipe to add to queue everywhere also in search 2) that downloads dont automatically delete themselves as downloads 3) easy button always to go to queue
"Spotify is amazing! The family option is really cheap, which is great. But there's something wrong with my Playlist, i wqnt the Playlist to run in order, not shuffled. I didn't use the shuffle button."
Fantastic app with great algorithms for finding the sounds that suit you. Also the Spotify Wrapped thing is amazing
So you fix the radio but know the like button isn't working
"Love the app, it has quickly become my #1 music source/player. However, I noticed recently that when paired with my car it doesn't show artist/song details like it was doing before. How do I fix this? I can still control the music with my steering wheel controls so it isn't the end of the world. Just a lil frustrating."
"One of, if not THE best app to listen to music! An amazing sharing experience, a wonderful collection even though geolocking causes problems and, with the introduction of the ""Add to Queue"" feature for albums, radio recommendations and more, Spotify has seamlessly made the user experience that much more organic and immersive! One star shy of a full score because of recurring technical issues (app crashing frequently, downloaded songs unavailable) and unintuitive ""Library"" section."
"It's great to be able to listen to any music that you want at anytime and make playlists. Really good stuff. Only thing is that I am unable to find the function that allows you to fluidly move back and forth on the as you would using a DJ app. Would be great if Spotify would incorporate a DJying app/ component, complete with all the tweaks like sirens, scratching, voice overs etc. Otherwise, Spotify just opened a whole new world of music listening pleasure. Love it!"
Audio randomly cuts off and doesn't continue once the screen switches off - poor design.
"Spotify is exceptionally well made! I haven't found anything in this app that is in need of correction. Seamlessly intuitive and remarkable, that sums it up in my opinion."
I love Spotify. My only complaint is that the UI is ugly and boring. It's not as attractive and as premium looking as Apple Music. I'd appreciate it if improvements are made soon.
Great access to a huge amount of music. The app could be a little more intuitive.
I can not tell you how much this app has inspired me from day to day! I get up every morning and plan on being more productive than the day before. And even just taking showers I go from just a blah day to an absolute happy day in the span of 5 minutes!!!! So if you have not gotten Spotify yet I encourage you to go on your mobile devices and download it as quickly as possible. Because this app has changed my life and can do the same for you guys!!!!
"The app is very intuitive to the listener and seems to have an unlimited amount of genre, recommendations, and diversity. Keep up the good work Spotify!"
"Wow gr8, Just please make very interactive UI design for Spotify"
Easy to set up and quick response
"I love Spotify. Please, when send new features for test, keep available in the home, because sometimes we need exit screen and, when back isn't more available. But we have experiemnt new features please! Add optional button to skip."
Love the extensive music Spotify kept me up to date with. Very hard to quit after I have tried it.
Love being able to save my own play list. No matter what genre I want to listen to Spotify has the recordings built into the program of the songs I like. Thank you Spotify for giving me the freedom of choosing my music.
"I'm enjoying the 3 free months. I've even able to create my own playlist with tons of songs that I'm ashamed I know... I'm almost 40, in about 3 years but some of the songs like the TLC songs that included Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes do not compare to the stuff being pushed out now... Good good app to feel good to. Who's paying for this? (CQuinnzDaily on Instagram)"
"Ads too many,but the song quality is quite good"
"I love to listen to music on spotify it is really nice but I just have one problem, why is there no repeat button for me?"
Fantastic app. Being an afificiando of music it was a real pain having to look for the covers and different versions of my favourite songs. Spotify you can quite easily get what you're looking for and find stuff you didn't know existed. Keeps the soul well fed.
"Its a good little app, no problems with it. Just wish I could export liked song to a playlist of it own without having to manually build it by and add each song thats already in a list."
Love the app. It could use a GUI polishing but the functionality of the app is fantastic.
Its a wonderful experience except where it keeps cutting off after 3 songs which is quite annoying
I love Spotify and music to list to the muisc.
Very nice. Just improve on the search engine as it requires you to be correct on your search query for you to get what you want.
"Super experiences, but add features to control music inbuilt for beginner users, like Samsung music"
I've had Spotify over apple music for years now and I'm loving the updates they've been releasing. All I'm waiting for now is a way to quickly filter to the clean version of songs. If there is a way anyone knows about please let me know. Still 5 stars for me.
I do like how easy it is to build a song list or find someone else's list that works great. I like the fun interface and the yearly sign up that gives me a discount.
"Spotify is best to be used on a Tablet or consoles like Xbox or Playstation so you can have more freewill choosing songs you love, unlike in the phone versions where you are required to choose a playlist to play with a six song free skip every 30 minutes."
"Its intuitive, easy to use, and the algorithm is amazing"
Best music streaming app. Easy to access and really good UI. Lot of room to create and asset playlists. Suggesting playlist from the app is really good too.
"Has the Range of music, suitable for all age groups & also for situations."
Very good apart from the ads every two songs...can we not make it 4/5 really ruins the vibe
"Simple, elegant and easy to use music player. It has a good recommendation system, the UI is easy and clean, you can make playlists and share to others, or listen to other people's playlists, this allows to share music tastes with eachother. The ads aren't that annoying, they only come every 30 minutes and the subscription service for it is cheap aswell. If you love music, this is an obvious must-have, with all the features right off the bat for free, I wouldn't see why you shouldn't try this."
Would be a 5 star if I could select multiple songs when rearranging a Playlist. Otherwise great job fixing many little things that improved overall user experience thanks Spotify team
"Pretty great, haven't noticed anything wrong with the mobile version. Would be great to have a built in equalizer on the PC, but there's already one on mobile."
"Love it!! It has virtually every obscure artists that I love and every great guitarist popular and not so popular that I could ever want to follow including some of the people I take lessons from on YouTube, really a fantastic service and you get a lot for free, I can't recommend this enough to my family and friends"
"Genuinely love the app, have found so Manny great artists, of course there's ads so if u don't want those pay but the app makes me so happy"
"Awesome collection of music, very intuitive interface and easy to cast to other audio devices. What's lacking is hd audio, else a 5 star app"
"The app is good and i can listen to almost 99% of the music i want, only problem.after every 4 songs the ad plays which is quite annoying but anyway the overall experience is really good.I love spotify."
I expressed concerns about my account being hacked and they quickly responded by logging me out of all my accounts so that I could download and create a new password for my account. I was impressed.
Great app . Loads up quickly and selection response is quick. Very well set up.
Love it it gots all of my favorite songs that I really love and listen to alot but I hate that they put ads It just ruins the music im listening to it just ruins the vibe
"Had Amazon Music. This is a definite upgrade. I am a Gen X guy, so I am still figuring it all out, but it's really intuitive. I hear ya, ""Ok Boomer..."" I am not THAT old. Pretty old though. What were we talking about?"
"Best app for listening to music. I just wish they had more songs that I've heard, and I'd like if they'd put a speed up or slow down button for songs like they have for podcasts."
Needs to have a speed button thing so you can make your music faster or slower.
"UPDATE: You guys fixed the issue! Thanks a lot! I love the app in general and the service behind it. One thing you needd to look into: once the user uses Android in dark mode, Spotify apps control and slider graphics are vanished from the UI. Or at least that's how it seems. Fix this please!"
"Conistently enjoyable premium experience. Any issues I've had were quickly resolved. I do wish some of the UI options were a bit less confusimg and hidden away. Oherwise, a great app."
Better than YouTube because there aren't any simply guitar ads at the end and before each song.
Spotify I love you. I am a loyal subscriber. When you're at the song/album/artist main screen there should be a inconspicuous button for the artist. üëåü§ô
"When I play any one specific song. Spotify tends to revert to some Playlist of the same 10 or so songs, over and over again. It's quite frustrating"
"Great selection and audio quality, app runs well and the UI is easy and clear to navigate."
Absolutely an incredible app! Thanks Bill Simmons for guiding me here with your must hear Ringer Podcasts üòÅüòÅüòÅ
"I'm OK with the hole experience, I would love to have the lyrics available, I don't really care that much about the story behind the songs. Just give me the plain lyrics. Additional to this, there seems to be no feedback button."
"so so good. i've been using spotify for years and it's genuinely changed who i am as a person. i have access to so many different songs across so many different genres, and the user interface is just out of this world. 10/10 would recommend"
So none of my songs will play. They show a play button but only play for a few seconds. Why?
"I must say that for the last couple of months the app has been improved quite noticebly. Devs implement better playlist management (ability to add track to the queue with single quick swipe, ability to add an entire playlist to another playlist), interface works smoother and more responsive. There are still lags, but I see improvment. Lags weren't addressed for months now and got even worse. Finally I see some work done to fix them so I've updated my review from 3 to 5 stars."
"Music recommendations algorithm - 10/10 UI needs some work- An example: can't swipe down to bring down the 'Now playing screen' and reaching for the top most times be stressful. Another: The status bar isn't transparent, makes the whole app look weird, like it was designed poorly But in general- Really really good"
"Great app if you have premium, a bit annoying that once a playlist gets too long (like liked songs) it's almost impossible to see all the old songs you liked from years ago outside of spamming the shuffle button or going to your rewind."
"I have been using Spotify for a long time. The collection, recommendation algorithm and the dark simple UI is what has made me stay. It's perfect."
"Pretty cool app, they messed up some perfectly good features for a better design but nothing too major."
Better than ever. Enhance button for Playlist is good for discovering new songs
"Irritating that it frequently glitches, at the end of or in the middle of songs or podcasts, and requires restart of the app or entire phone."
This app named Spotify is a good app for listening to music üé∂ . I have so many music that I like I have to search the music in the search button. But now I can listen music without searching by putting my song in the liked song. It is a very good application to listen music I rated this app 5 star because this is a very good and perfect app for listening music..
"The menu button does not load and keeps telling me to ""go online to see menu"" even though I am online and streaming music. This issue persists regardless on my wifi and mobile data connection. Very unreliable loading for this menu makes it difficult to edit my queue or set a sleep timer."
"It's a great app for discovering new music, and one of the latest updates that suggests a new weekly play list to suit your style is great. But it would be nice to leave reviews on podcasts like Apple allows."
More than just listening to your favourites it's the best service for finding similar music. Just has a really good algorithm. Plus the app has many features many other players/services I've tried either don't have or aren't as intuitive. Edit: This is how it is for Premium. I wouldn't recommend using it on a free account. It's plagued with long ads I think more as a nuisance to coerce you into getting premium plus you can only listen to shuffled songs which is almost useless.
I love spotify and I do not have preminum but that doeset matter to me because I still love this app. And it has so many different podcasts and types of muisc and thousands of songs. I love how you can make playlists and stuff and I also love how you can donload podcasts without preminium. I totally recomend this app and I am being one hundred precent honest. You need spotify in your life.
Song recommendations are good. Bollywood recommendations need to improve. Ads should decrease. English lyrics are really required for non-English songs.
Perfect! Free with No ads. Build your own playlist. They have pre made playlists based off your preferences. I absolutely love Spotify and I'm not going to another app!
"Found a quite annoying bug. When pairing with my PS4 and using the mobile version to control, on every single activity/page I (re)enter pops up a dialog asking me if I want to keep using the PS4 to listen or change to the Phone speakers. Even after I answer to keep it on the PS4. Besides that the only thing missing is a 2-factor-authentication. Anything else is quite nice."
Spotify is the perfect application for Music streaming. Very simple but equipped with all the features you will need in a streaming application.
"This is a rewrite and reaffirmation of the quality of this application; if you're a music lover, then Spotify is for you. This app was designed for music first and foremost, and premium subscribers (like myself) have gotten many years of good times via music through its interface and discover weekly (without the ads that hamper the free users experience). The most recent controversy trying to take down Spotify is unconvincing for me; this is not a platform, but THE platform for music/podcasts.‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Excellent player. Would you mind thinking about placing the three dot button on the top right corner on the bottom, under the play / pause button? It might simplify things for bigger screen users üôèüèΩ. Thank you for making it better with every update."
"Too many ads, when you play two songs the ad will come and ruin your mood. So please , resolve this issue . I am using spotify from last two years . I can find any song here but ad is my main issue and some playlist are waste which spotify can remove ."
"Generally a solid app, but as of writing this review, a small annoying issue has cropped up where, if I'm using the mobile app to control the music on a different device (my Xbox, for example) and I go off the app, every time I come back to the app it asks me if I want to continue listening on the Xbox, despite usually being able to keep running fine in the background. A small issue, but one that can become increasingly annoying quite quickly if not fixed. Had never happened before today."
"Some UX and design decisions bother me, but it is still my go-to music listening solution. Edit: After years and years of waiting, they added the swipe to queue gesture iPhones had for ages. Finally. :)"
I love Spotify! It even lets you use different screens on your phone while listening with no inturruptions and with any paid subscriptions. Also.. Very intuitive...
"Great app, and really intuitive! There is only one problem that stops me from giving it five stars. I'm an opera lover, and I want at the very least a synopsis and a full libretto, in more than one language. After all, you (generally) get this when you buy the CD, so why not on Spotify? I find myself having to hunt around on the internet for the libretto. Sometimes it's almost impossible: poor quality librettos, poor translations etc. Sometimes it's completely unavailable."
"Listen to your music will a full on emersive experience, they create specific playlists for you, where you can descover new music, or you can create your own playlists and have them designed how you like, Spotify is the best place to get your music and it is loved by so many."
Spotify always works for me when I go to use it and everything is quick to load in
Great UI with exceptional playlists tailored to my preferences.
I use to use apple music/YouTube premium once I switched to Spotify I couldn't go back. I love how easy it is to make Playlist! I've only had one issue within the two years of me using Spotify thar got resolved quickly enough.
"Great design. Liked songs loading is... Poor. 10% loaded, others are forgotten, visible on many playlists."
"Till Now, i have Spotify 5 stars, Best UI, Top quality music, user friendly experience and much more, but lately, you beggars started adding 2-2 ads every time and that too more frequently, 1 min of waste, earlier, i could have a 30 sec and and then go on playing for sometime, but now, its turned to trash, soon shifting to other app. You people are pure beggars, come on roads, I'll donate a rupee."
"honestly my favorite app. - Contractor that hates commercials/Ads Can you guys please put a quick button to add a song to a playlist? So many great tunes, but a small pain to have to manually add them each time ^^ Thank You! Support Joe Rogan!"
Excellent easy and quick working order
The UI changes from week to week. Why to constantly change the GUI? Edit: There are short 5-6 sec long videos streamed over both mobile data and wifi; even for premium users. -Fixed thank you! Edited rating from 3 to 4 stars!
"one of the best if not the best music app around. The UI is great, simple and easy to use. The selection of songs and the playlists that are created most use the music preference of the users.. keep up with the good job."
"The app is really good..so far. We get the lyrics for english songs and its great as we can sing the song we love but nowadays the app quits on its own its so frustrating..hope it gets better soon, doesn't have a nice lyrics for Punjabi but its all good"
Such a vast selection of music. Very easy to navigate controls. One of many options is building different libraries.
This is a very good app but they stop offering periuim membership because we don't have enough money to buy it
One of the best app I've ever seen...clean UI and is compatible with my Alexa and Google assistant
"Wonderful. It's a good thing. Just that often, the song doesnt display. And sometimes it stops by itself. Which is quite frustrating. Thanks, all in all good app."
"It's been working great, but I'm experiencing some bugs. For example the x button to clear a song isn't functioning."
I've had premium for quite a while now and it's good. But please add canvas in spotify india. Don't feel like paying anymore for premium if y'all not gonna give it to us
"The best music app anywhere hands down, have used this app for a long while and have never had any problems. Those trolls giving bad reviews who use the free version quit complaining, buy a subscription no ads and great music..."
"Well i like this app good muic im uing for 5 and more years now, if the price dont go up i will keep my subscrition"
This app is easy to understand but the ads sometimes ruin your vibe üòû
"It's so frustrating that the app adds random songs to your library without asking if you wamt them there in the first place, I'll literally add 5 songs in the evening to listen to and the next morning, there are literally 30 songs In my playlist/folder/library. Please add a side button that will keep suggested songs Seperate from one's you have chosen specifically, so that there's no mess up"
Essential option for one's major hobby as a music collector. Developers please ensure that every update retains the button that moves the songs up and down the Library.
"This app is really good for listening to a wide range of music and podcasts. The only problem I have is when my account randomly decides to log out and the link, that is sent to my email so I can login without a password, doesn't work. I press on it a few minutes late and it says that the link has expired despite the mail saying it'll be usable for 4 hours. Pls fix the logout problem and the link problem, otherwise it's quite nice."
Variety of music hence interesting selection that suits the listeners taste and preference.
"Superb. All the music you want on tap for less than the price of a CD every month? Absolute no-brainer. Great for finding new music, old favourites you'd forgotten about, or stuff you had missed at the time.? I'm genuinely puzzled by those who are saying it's slow or crashes and I can only assume it's their phones (I have a relatively powerful Sony Xperia 5 ii) and I've had no issues at all either with logging in or with performance. I honestly can't fault it at all, also switches seamlessly"
As a whole this app is very good at being a music/podcast streaming app (i have the paid version). I don't have many of the issues that I see people commonly mention such as frequent crasking etc. However that being said there are 2 changes I would like to see that would improve the experience to a better level. 1) the quick scroll bar om the right side of the screen needs to be brought back to aid scrolling through long playlist. 2) volume needs to be increased through the app
"I'm a premium user. And I like the way the app is build . It's very user friendly and the song suggestions an dthe playlists are really good. I really like this app. But there's one thing that i think if implemented in this. It would be good that's reordering the songs in playlist that I made. This is the only missing feature I found. If you can add it, I'd really appreciate that. And you guys have done a great job."
"The app is functional, overall. There aren't that much ads but I came across something, I wanted to play my playlist and that's all I wanted but the suggested songs get in the way. I used all my skips just to atleast try to get back to my playlist and then I got stuck in a song I don't even like! I suggest adding some kind of Play Playlist Only button, because it ruins the mood when you start to listen to music that you aren't even familiar with."
Love this app. Just need to fix the queuing issue when playing daily mix and other songs that you add to queue but can't get into queue to change. üòçüòé
"I was all about every other thing, until a relative shared a song link and I began a wonderful journey through a variety of Hip-Hop tracks. And so came to be my first playlist from liked songs. When I built my own playlists, some enhanced etc., I became hooked. Now I'm playing music all throughout the days, switching playlists based upon mood or location. Overall great üëç‚ö°"
Pretty good app but a little too busy in its design.
I'm having a problem with the new update it's about the scroll button it doesn't work at all and doesn't tell which month the song was added the button which was earlier on the app was pretty good and helpful but the current button is just a huge waste
"Amazing! All the songs you could ever want! My only not pick is that it randomly skipps songs without me pressing the button. I have tried premium membership and it is stunning! No false advertisement and exactly what you are told you are purchasing! I do think the rules are a bit stupid, especially when it doesn't acc let u choose the songs u want to listen to and gives u like 4 ads in a row."
"Really good app design, but I have premium and can't pin more than 4 playlists. Please allow more pins, the arbitrary limit is pointless. Please add better witgets as well, so that I can get to my playlists quicker."
Love the ability to create a playlist song by song or by choosing an artists entire album. I like the similar artist/songs option when your playlist has run its course. Makes building a playlist a little easier as well as finding new music. I wish I could figure out how to combine one playlist with another though.
"It's really nice but the ads just ruin the moon, the ads suck, but over all it's all good"
"Design, sound quality, features , everything is great. I just love it. üíï"
"Love the Permiun Plan. I cant stand when music stops just to play an ad. The continuious play does'nt do thar, its perfect, and the price per month isnt to bad either.."
"2022: works well these days with improved quality 2019:Bad UX and buggy. Sync issues, continuity issues on different devices, button states, disables buttons etc"
"Its a great app (in my opinion) because it doesn't require wifi, I ride on a bus to school and back and I don't have mobile data so it's helpful to have a way to listen to music on a long bus ride. Thanks for reading"
"This is the best music and podcast app out there. With all of its capability. It does crash. It does freeze. It does require force free stopping, etc etc. But they are always working to try and make it better."
I generally love spotify but lately it won't let me add any songs. That button is no longer there sand i don't know why. That needs to be fixed.
Easy to use. I love the music recommendations when I build a play list.
I am a premium user. Song listings & albums are superb. Collections are super cool. Awesome experience. But still I got a complain. Spotify declares it uses high quality audio but I think Saawan or Gaana holds much better sound quality & clarity. Dev.'s should look for the quality matter & I also think.... Spotify should add a preset equilizer for song varieties.
New to the streaming apps. Enjoying it so far. Building my playlist! üëç
"I can log in and gain streams I am happy now,I love spotify I RECRUIT HOT guys girls using this very app."
Love itt!!! Resolved the issue quickly and everything is good Just 4 stars because the adds are a bit frustrating
M using spotify from many years and m spotify premium user from 2020. Now m facing login issue using facebook which is premium account from yesterday. Now i dont have any clue to login or cancel my subscription. Please guide me
Thus app is amazing it let's you listen to your music. Yes it does have ads every now and then but to honest with you it is quite good I can listen to music perfectly and have to worry about a thing when I'm listening to music. Some people may disagree and that's okay but I just really love this app so I would give it 5 out of 5.
"It was working fine on my caraudio with the build in App, but since the last Update the App is no longer working, have to use the Bluetooth connection, what sucks"
Love it but the Spotify add over and over. It's nice when I am playing my games and just want peace and quiet and music.
So so good to have such a wide variety of music and podcasts at the press of a button. Really love this app.
"This is such a great music app. It gets customized according to our tastes so flawlessly that the recommendations are so apt for you. The ads were a hurdle at the beginning but once you start using it constantly, the ads gradually decrease. This is the best music streaming app you can ever get and believe me, I HAVE tried out quite a few......."
Awesome algorithm and user experience.
"For me, Spotify is quite awesome."
"Great app, the only negative is they keep messing with the UI and I think most of the changes are negative. They keep trying to make it more 'clean', but this just leeds to needing more touches to get to where you want. Also the new my library section sucks! I now have to keep clicking on my playlists rather than it just started on there!"
My only issue is the amount of clicks that are required to add songs to a specific folder. I would like to be able to search for songs for a specific folder and add them with one touch.
"A good app not to lie all the song you need are there from the common to the uncommon. But it doesn't have it own download button like Apple music does, if you won't to download one song for an album you will have to download the album and that's not good. Plsssss fix that ok üëç"
"Best app to use to listen to music or podcast, sometimes people make playlist that seem perfect for you. Only downside is adds and only having 6 song skips an hour but once you build a good like/love list most songs your not going to skip unless just based on a mood."
I still love the app loads but recently my shuffle button on my playlist hasn't been working. App is still amazing but that abit annoying
"Fully satisfied with UI, sound quality etc. I would like if you add stuff like visualization of sound like in VLC Media Player"
Great app! But those ads are ruining my mood when they pop up when I'm down listening to sad songs but I now got the premium at it is great!
"Amazing , especially device connect ui and system love it whenever go just connect to tv,pc on tho go and speaker switch is awesome man hats off of kn my fav üòç"
"Building playlist on google premium, i dont want commercials."
Love Spotify and they are very helpful and quick to answer enquiries.
"WHAT THE HECK SPOTIFY, I don't like this new UI for the home mobile app, it's bad enough that the recently played is at the home instead of the play queue, I hope you redress this issue NOW!!"
I'm assuming an update ruined my app. There used to be a bar that showed the song that is currently playing and it gave the option to pause the song. The only way for me to stop music from playing right now is to force stop the entire application. Plus I can't even tell what song is playing or who is by unless it's the song I specifically put on. Even then I only know because its the song I requested. Not because the app displays that information.
"Best music service available in India as per recommendations, UI, spotify connect feature go. But still waiting for Spotify Hi-Fi."
"Autoplay needs to be fixed, please do so quickly. Additionally, please also provide .flac and such higher audio quality codecs"
"Big Problem: Defeating Shuffle Play. I like making playlists for friends. As a Premuim subscriber frustrated that I can't toggle Shuffle Play OFF. When sharing carefully DJ'd playlists to friends they naturally press the big green Play button, which automatically SHUFFLES the order of songs for them! Have to leave instructions (tedious for both) for how to play songs in the intended order. Counterintuitive! Please FIX!! OTHERWISE I LOVE SPOTIFY!!!"
I like Spotify a lot and have a paid subscription but for some reason I cannot play anything today. I click play and the button glimmers but nothing happens. It might have started last night.
"Excellent app. Got all I need and much more. Keep up the great work. One snag though, the volume of the tracks on some albums are quite low while most are high. Can this be equalized across all the albums on spotify? Asides this two thumbs up¬ø¬ø‚ñ™ pls add Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five - They Said It Couldn't Be Done album to Spotify."
"Even without premium this app is amazing for songs. Before I downloaded this app (which was 2 years ago now) I would always have trouble remembering all the songs I like, but after downloading this, you can keep all the songs you like, no matter how many, in one place by simply pressing the white outlined heart on a song. The app has all the features you could ever need without premium, no songs require premium to listen to, and you still get 6 skips per hour without premium."
Spotify meets all of my music requirements. A great experience indeed.
"UI should be enhanced more to make the app look and feel more professional, handy, and buttery smooth"
"It's cool when I'm in the mood to listen to music üé∂ Otherwise, it's an app that I have to pay for even if I don't use it. Which is pretty lame. Companies like this don't care if you get your money's worth as long as they can squeeze you for every dime they possibly can. Otherwise, they'd design the app so that you get charged when you use it. Back when I was a teen, it wouldn't have mattered to me bc I pretty well lived on music. Now, I only listen to üé∂ while I race on my PS5."
Absolutely Amazing app... Its has a Great UI and Flawless streaming experience... Full 5 stars... If there was an option for 6 stars ....then i would vote it full 6 stars
The app is absolutely good no doubt in it but the ads are the things that ruin it that's why I'm giving 4 stars.... like I'm enjoying some aesthetic music but then an ad for a horror podcast comes so that is why I'm giving 4 stars but overall it's good app so anyone who si finding a good music app spotify is a good option but if u want a music app without ad I will not recommend this app......
"Was hesitant to use this app at first but when I realized the sheer volume of music available, I had to download it to my phone. I've had no issues with the app so far and I'm quite happy with the available music and podcasts."
"An excellent choice for your music station and more. With the premium feature - which is quite affordable - you can have the luxury of listening music with style and comfort that makes you enjoy your day more. There are thousands choices of music, artists, genre and playlist that you can choose from and make your own playlist. The joy and comfort of enjoying music at the tip of your finger!"
Issues since the last update on Samsung S21+. The music quits playing in the middle of a song and the music controller on the bottom of the screen in not there to skip songs.
Get variety of all types of music all at one touch of a button
"Great UI and functionality, looking forward to getting Hi-Fi quality tier. One feature suggestion would be sub-playlists (e.g. Metal: [Heavy Metal, Thrash metal, etc])."
"I'm having premium subscription but I feel there is two requirements as follows: 1. There should be a Equalizer setting because when we play same song on Instagram, there is a huge difference. 2. You should have SORT option like BY YEAR because we make playlist according to Singer Wise & if we want to listen 2002-05 songs of different albums in our playlist, we can't adjust the songs by year wise it was released. Please help us solving in this two issues especially the YEAR WISE SORT FEATURE."
"I have premium and I'd recommend it over all others like iTunes music, Pandora, exc. It's great and if you pair it with Shazam you can find new music and get music you are listening to quickly. It has hands free vehicle mode and voice activation also. It's well worth the price"
"I have a big problem with this app, after Android 12 (miui 13) update, Playlist shortcut not work at all. Please fix it"
It's a great streaming platform. There are no glitches and it's easy to order your music in the way you like it. The algorithm also catches on quickly to your taste and suggests music accordingly.
There is a problem in my laptop version because sometime I get a small parallel button before minimising or closing time. Please do check and rectify.
It's really good and I would recomend to others but I really wish it didn't add things to my playlist because the majority of the time it absolutely sucks and ruins the mood :( I have a Disney playlist BC Disney is life yk and it recommend ACDC which is no where near the vibe I wanted and I couldn't get rid of it BC it had already recommend really bad songs I skipped before that Also they have added way more adds now and the majority of them are unskipable so unless you can pay than don't get it
I have been using spotify for 3months its very good. But the only problem is the Previous and the Next buttons we cant be getting 6 skips per hour please work on that. Otherwise download this app has all the music you want thank you
If you can afford the premium Def get it. Free version is just as good minus adds and no back button.
I really like this app it is really good for music on the move and discovering new music to love however unless you have premium (which is quite pricey) you are bombarded with adds with spoil your groove.
This is a really great app i take the headphones and connect it to mobile and open spotify.. And my favourite rapper emiway buntai and listening his rap and in few hours . I complete my school and tuitions HOMEWORK . THIS A VERY NICE AND MOTIVATIONAL APPüòÅüëåüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
"If you're in an environment where you need to constantly play music, then Spotify is your best option. The app contains tons of playlist that you can choose from to suit your environment."
You can use it to get the podcasts for free. Their music playlists are quite nice. It is a recent discovery that this app is pretty rockin
"Premium subscriber here,my experience with spotify has been good except for being a bit laggy sometimes.However,after the update the song just suddenly stops and when I play it again it goes back to the beginning. It's vv annoying and ruins my listening experience"
"Please, add forward and previous song buttons in the bottom notification within the app"
"Overall a Great App, confused why only the Mobile Version requires Premium to Operate to its Fullest. I am only bumping this to 4 Stars for 2 Reasons. 1. It Plays Suggested Songs in the 'Liked Songs' Playlist. It Counteracts the Point of it Being a Liked Songs Playlist. 2. The Filters for The Liked Songs Playlist has recently stopped working for me. I will select 'Pop' or 'Musicals' and it'll just generally play my Liked Playlist. Ive tried to Log out and Uninstall it. Nothing works to fix it."
LOVE this app. Suits all my music needs. Thanks for the amazing app.
"Love the application. A built in EQ would be really great. My only complaint is about the update: I can't see the ""What's New"" Section here. No change log on the page at all. I am always hesitant to update any software without first reading the log. Please provide the ""Whats New"" or simply link the changelog for us. Thanks guys!"
Excellent app that provide good recommendations but do come with irritating ads.Well desinged interface and user experience.
Easy to set up for music I like. Have found every song I've looked for very quickly. Saves me storing music on my phone as I have started building a library on the app for instant access. Excellent app.
"Really good most of time. Didn't like the adverts or restrictions on the free service so paid for 'premium"" which in my opinion is far better and worth the monthly subscription. I like how intuitive Spotify is for recommending similar songs to my playlists. Occasionally (the reason for only 4 stars) the app freezes on my phone and the only way to get it working again is by unistalling and reinstalling. If Spotify could sort out this little glitch I would give it 5 stats."
"4 years of qauilty audio, and an constantly improving system !"
The UI is a little wonky on the tablet (specifically the global nav being on the left hand side of the screen instead of across the bottom) but it is still a great app!
"Love Joe Rogan, and also a pretty good app. Please stop updating so quick tho, barely get used to soemthing before having to change."
"I've been a Spotify member since before 2010, used it on my iphone and now my Google phone. Any issues I have are usually with the Google assistant working with Spotify (ex playing wrong playlist) and my number 1 complaint is if I say ""play daily mix #"" it plays some album from Luis masters. I now hate Luis masters, but if you're not using voice commands it's fine."
Over-all fun to use but please either put an option to edit the default favorites playlist or stop making the add favorite icon (green heart) too close to the pause/play button. As an exclusive user of my favorites list I'm tired of accidentally removing songs from months ago and adding them on an order I don't like
Simply functional and intuitive.
"STOP GIVING ME THE PERIOD PADS ADS IT JUST RUINS THE MOOD I CAN'T EVEN LISTEN TO MUSIC WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED BY AN ADVERTISEMENT, it's not helping anyone, it's just annoying at this point. But overall it's really great and I recommend it if you have the money to buy Premium :)"
"Very easy to use! Nice audio quality and time passer, I know most people don't have the money for premium but I completely recommend it! You get unlimited song skips, offline music listening, (via download button on playlist) next song image preview, better audio quality, ability to listen to songs not in your Playlist fully, and all for $10 CAD a month! Really great app, I even got my parents in on the perks and bought them both a premium account. Would recommend 10 times out of 10!"
"The locking up problem is, I'm praying gone. Also closing apps and dumping me back in my homepage while I'm typing. I think my music selection sometimes was too quick for the app. I have slowed it down. Ok for now. Also love how EASY to send out problems to Spotify. That's a great thing."
I love this app it is great I even have the lyrics too I am so happy üòÅ also it is really quick to install even with low storage space.
"It's a good music app just not as effective at recommending music. I used to listen with Pandora which despite having a smaller library, recommended music better suited to my taste. I found more music I loved that way. Hope algorithm gets better."
Quick loading. Good free trial. Helps artists.
Spotify app is so beautifully designed offering a lot of choices and it literally knows what you like. üëåüëå‚úå‚úåüíØ
why did you remove the share lyrics button from my Spotify:( i need it back please return it for 5 stars!
If you are searching for an music app Must try it . I love this application. Its design and search pool is amazing You will love it's working style .go and must try onceüëçüòÄ
"Lyrics. We finally have in-app lyrics. And they brought back the quick search within liked songs. For a premium user, this is definitely an excellent experience."
I give this a 5 star because the app is designed well for Teens and adults. I really don't mine the ads on this app. My favorite part about this app is it has a setting for Explicit content. It shows E so I know if itis going to say bad stuff. I really injoy that because I don't like bad stuff. Also thay have clean versions of songs that I love. Thanks
This apps just so good I've been listening to Spotify for a long time everything's good but there's just one problem with ads its just so disturbing while your enjoying your song there comes the ad to ruin your enjoyment üòëüòí
"I really love this app so far, it's very cool and easy to navigate, the UI & UX are extremely awesome so perfect"
"Fantastic. Works well with an Alexa, which was not very compatible with apple. Users can interact and share content quite easily."
Fantastic App! Subscribe! Very intuitive and excellent content! Listen to Joe Rogan all day long! Malone interview is very informative. We should be ashamed of our medical industries tyrannical ambitions!
"Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world. Basic functions such as playing music are totally free, but you can also choose to upgrade to Spotify Premium. ... Build collections of music and podcasts. And more! Spotify is an excellent streaming music service that wins PCMag Editors' Choice award."
"I can always find the songs, albums, and content I'm wanting. The app is quick to start up. And I haven't had but just a few glitches or freeze ups. Finally a music app that works...."
"EDIT: I have songs downloaded and it keeps telling me I need internet connection. I redownload the songs and the same thing happens. I have the membership to download the songs, so why am I paying it when I still need connection to listen to the songs. Enjoying all my favorite music. Quick to put new music. Love it"
Good experience. Less ads required.
Super op its is best for muice app and its really op i listen 2000 songs üòéüòéüòéüòé
An amazing app a close friend of all musicans..ui can say proudly..my self as a MUSIC DIRECTOR and FLUTIST...of ANYTICKETS MUSICAL EVNTS LONDON.
It's fantastic!!!!!!! Omgg ik this isn't BECAUSE of this app but music is one of my therapy. This is also the reason why I took out one star. Music is one of my therapy and ads are constantly ruining the therapy mood. But this app is fire and the lite version is more.
"It worked fine before but they updated it and its ruined always freezing, unliking songs etc. I bought premium and it was worth it but not anymore. Please fix your app!"
It was quite nice just that not alot of options for songs **some that I like are not there
Switched to YouTube Music after Spotify was in the news recently over bad press. Best choice I've made in years as I discovered that it is more suited to my needs. Spotify is still a great service but YT music premium is half the price. $5 vs $10 per month. I recommend trying out this app and also testing out other platforms to see what fits for you. Spotifys free service is hard to beat. If you are looking for a premium subscription I recommend checking out YT music.
"It's a very good app, the ready-made playlist by Spotify is all good songs recomendations. But right now I have been seeing some features of my friends on Spotify that I don't have in my Spotify, just like the 'share' button on the lyrics."
I have been using paid version of spotify for quite a few years now and still love it!
"Great app,, nice ui,, smooth experience,, great music quality,, less ads,, üëåüëç,, awesome app üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"This is the best music streaming platform around. I canceled my subscription as audio had weird, not-so-punchy bass, but I have now revisited the app and found that audio normalization is to blame. Now the bass is the same as other platforms. The app is stable and the overall experience is great. The music selection is quite rich and literally every device/OS supports Spotify, including WearOS. Overall, satisfied and will most likely subscribe."
App is very easy to maneuver. Just wish the app would learn my music taste quicker. But otherwise the songs I do fine are easy to add into playlists.
"It's a really good app. I probably use Spotify every single day, though I only give 4 stars because I really would like the same features that are on computer, to be the same for mobile. I don't think it's quite fair, but I believe it'll get there one day."
Yall have translated lyrics integrated with the song's normal lyrics now. Helps in singing with feelings. Saw it on Dos oruguitas. Yall are winning and I'M here for it! Really excited to see what more you guys will bring to the table! Keep going!
"I cant log into my spotify, keeps telling me its set to offline, when i press connect it doesnt work and sends me a email link, when i press on the link it says it may have expired. Yet the link expires after 4 hours plz help i dont know what to do Edit: team was very quick and helpful and im back to listening to my music again:)"
"Good app that I've had since it was launched, and can't complain that they have held the same ¬£9.99 since it started, there's no way I could ever build such a huge diverse music collection by spending the same on downloads. If I could set songs I have downloaded to use off-line as ringtone, it would get 5 stars. I don't really like the current versions layout of 'My library'..... but I can live with these small frustrations."
I love Spotify. But the thing is that I can't see the playback and pause/play button bar so you can't look at the Musixmatch lyrics anymore. I can't rewind or fast forward. I found this out just this morning. What's up with that?
Great UI but needs some major performance/stability improvements ASAP!!!!
"I love being able to listen to my favourite songs, however sometimes Spotify likes to add its own songs to your playlist. It can be quite annoying!! Overall I love this app and would definitely recommend it to others! :)"
"Intuitive interface easy to use and understand. Some clever features, set up for more social interaction than other sites."
"Amazing music, love this app . This app is like a guide , When I'm sad and happy i hear music through this app i love this app so much"
"Got a minor bug: In the ""liked songs menu"" you can filter the songs based on the genre. I use the aforementioned menu to get new music to add to a designated playlist later. The issue is if you filter it to a genre, then un-like the all the songs in that filter you can't select a different filter even if you take spotify out of your running apps and run it again. The only way to fix it is to add a song of the ""filter genre"""
"I love how easy and simple it is to work this app and two ads every few minutes is pretty reasonable. I kinda find it frustrating that you can only choose a few songs until you have to buy premium or wait for a while. It also gets a little bit annoying that you can only select one song at a time to put on a playlist on a phone, but I guess you could easily hop on a computer to do all that. Thanks for the app even though it doesn't meet all the requirements I want, but I'm still pretty happy!üòÉüéµ"
"Despite the junk out there, there's still just nothing as good as a quality app, UI and massive collection of music than this one. I went back to another brand for a few months and found myself wishing they had the swapping mechanism and variety Spotify has and have just come back."
"Great app, I get to find and listen to all my childhood songs and new songs. And God bless these folks for standing up to the ""woke"" liberal media and agenda seeking to stifle our personal freedoms, by continuing to support and provide great programing like Joe Rogan."
"Update: I have to say, support was spot on. They answered and solved my problem immediately. So I'm giving back 2 stars. If you have a premium account, though, pay exactly on time. But if there is a free option for this app, why do I have to be locked out of my account if a payment is late? Also, a lot of people seem to be having problems. The apps can't keep up with the newer phones because they're all different and designed to do what you needed an app for. Oh well. Onward and upward."
"Best UI and User experience, also best algorithm. Please keep working UI, and please work on Windows app as well."
why cant the feature that allows you to see what ur friends are currently listening to be on mobile and not just pc? i think my experience would be boosted like 80% more. Its such a pity. YES spotify should in a way be a socmed app. idc if it ruins my mental health and makes me more self conscious of what others think of me. as if i could ever get enough of that. this feature would be a game changer IM TELLING YOU.
It was a very good app and still is but now when i try to open the app its says that 'your offline' and it's been quite a few days so please try to get more updates and try to fix it
"Not perfect, but what ever is? Overall it's an excellent app that I plan on continuing to use and would recommend to others."
Ads aren't too bad. Would never spend money on music streaming but Spotify creates Playlist suited for you.
"I have spotify premium and I can completely recommend it. The algorithm is very good I discovered so many artists and songs thanks to him. The design is simple and pretty, the app has a lot of features and is very intuitive to use. I never had any technical problems either."
"Generally solid, use it a lot more than I thought I would when I bought it. Recently though the UI has bugged out a few times, the song will keep playing without any control panel coming up or option to go to the song playing screen. Usually fixed by closing and reopening the app, annoying but not a major issue."
"Still waiting for an ""add to playlist"" button on the player rather than being hidden in a menu. Difficult to organize songs because of this."
Love this app but one thing I would add. Where you click button that would listen to the music and tell you what it is.
"It's spotify what can you say? Good app, good user experience"
"Working well now The only improvement suggestion would be an option for a bigger widget than 1x4, then you could fit in buttons to turn random on/off, and maybe a drop down list of saved playlists etc. The widget just seems small and basic at the moment compared to widgets for mp3 players."
"I love Spotify. It has a premium plan designed for families so up to 6 people can have premium access. That's what I currently use and I love it! With premium you get unlimited access to music ad-free. You can queue songs and create playlists very easily. The only thing I don't like is the price. Without Premium, you get disruptive ads and limited song skips per hour, so it's a ""money vs value"" situation. If premium is too much for you be prepared for what I mentioned or just don't get this app."
I am having so much fun with this app! It is very intuitive in what I like.
"My one problem i have been having for quite some time is if i open spotify and click over to search or my playlists too quickly, the app freezes and starts to load forever. Thus making me close the app, open it and then waiting for the home screen stuff to load."
All Trending music and albums are available. Impressive UI.
"Go Spotify!! Don't let those Orwellian losers bully you into censoring the content you provide on your network! I really respect y'all for sticking to your guns and continuing to be a platform for all voices, not just those that certain people deem ""appropriate."" Also the app has greatly improved after going through a pretty big rough patch and I really appreciate the effort y'all put in for usability. My only quip is that Discover Weekly often has songs and artists I already listen to!! üòÜ"
Ads are quite annoying but everything else is good
"This app is amazing, but it drains your battery extremely quickly and you have to pay to listen offline. Also please stop adding songs into my playlist. I just want to listen to the songs I added"
I'm giving 4 stars because of everything. And 1 star less because Spotify needs to get a streamlined interface on Android. It should provide better viewing experience by improving the UI of the application in terms of alignment to Android 10 and later versions. It should be improved from the upper as well lower hands of the application as it looks separate from OS and not streamlined. Also it should be more smooth at some points in the app.
"Spotify is/has become the prime location for listening to music these days. The i tuitive UI, the range of music, the relatively inexpensive cost all form a good, cohesive experience. The one time I experienced a bug, the debelopers and support tram were quick to respond to my ticket. My only two complaints are: *Inability to switch off pop up ads, even if I already have premium *The diversity of music when it comes to remixes is a bit lacklustre (though this is to a degree not Spotifys fault)"
music quality and user experience is superb but it will be best if there is option of downloading songs without paid and music is playing in somewhat low sound
All bugs fixed so I'm upping my review. Use it daily and love it! Sometimes the UI can be clunky though.
I love Spotify this has my fav songs expect one also the ads it ruins the moment but if u get premium there will be no ads but this is a fav app I will always listen to songs everydayüéµüé∂üéº
One of the best music üéµ in play Store. No one can beat Spotify. Some of the best features are 1. Less Ads 2. Very Smooth UI. 3. Best Recommendations 4. Almost all songs available in Spotify.
"I'm a premium subscriber. The daily playlist is good and the recommendation engine is better than Google's (I also have paid YouTube music). If I stop listening on one device it will pick up where it left off if I resume on a second device which is important for podcasts. Sometimes it is playing audio, but in the UI it doesn't show any audio playing and the only way to get it to stop is to force quit. Not often but once is more than enough. If they fix that it will be a five star app."
"I can't use the lyrics sharing feature? I have deleted and installed the application many times, updated it, logged out of the account and logged in again, but it still does not have the ability to share lyrics. There is a place to share lyrics but there is no share button. That's why I took a star off. I hope officials answer this."
"Hi, I'm old Spotify user and I genuinely love this app. They provide you best quality addvertisements and they sometimes roast themselves so if you're having a breakdown at 2:34am listening to your fav song, they're just gonna roast themselves and make you laugh. Sometimes it's annoying when songs comes in between when I vibe on adds at my terrace but it's manageable. I thought about purchasing Spotify premium but I bought apple music cause it feels illegal to buy Spotify premium as a brown guy"
"Awesome app the most stable, well designed reliable music app"
Very easy and quick to use and straight forward
Simply the best music app picks on your flavour and dishes you extra precise suitable music according to your library
Good quality music quick and easy
"Spotify asking me to give them 5 star rating, personally I think they are equivalent to I-heart, Pandora, and the rest. They are all pretty good."
"Everything in this app is good in fact I love it but the one thing that make me hate it is ads Really, I know that ads can't be removed but it can be of less seconds and shown less so that we can enjoy the song . But the ads appear quickly one after other and they are of very seconds I mean really please please resuce the time of appearing an ad and also its seconds. Please it will be really helpful if you will make it . Thank You"
Great app very stable with a vast library of materials to suit most people's taste.
"Everything is good, hence this is the most famous and the most downloaded music app but the problem is the ads they show numerous ads to only take thier premuim lots of ads are there...üòÖ"
"This app continues to improve and premium is absolutely worth it. You can even play your own audio files. Problems get fixed, you can see your recents, UI is great, design is nice. Wrapped is always a highlight and you can mix yours with someone else. I love using it with maps too! Lyrics had been missing for years, im glad they're back! Problems rn: I might prefer if lyrics scrolled smoothly without the rapid change to the next line. I would also love to see which songs belong to which genres."
I pay premium i download my playlists and for some reason every few days the app undownlouds my songs and re-downloads them killing my battery and ruining my music experience at work where I don't have service and can't download them
"For the most part it works alright, except a little bit of slowdown on my phone, and a weird bug where no matter what set of headphones I use, the left speaker is much quieter than the right speaker."
There are some features in Spotify which I'm absolutely in love with : 1. Crossfade 2. Song gets automatically downloaded when added to a playlist 3. Able to control the playback from any device 4. Equalizer 5. Change quality of songs downloaded And the UI is just perfect.
"I've used spotify for years and I can't explain the experiance that this app has given me. The playlists it makes for me are great and I love every single song they have on there. I used to get told all the time that Apple music is better but with Spotify, you get what you couldn't from Apple music. With every add I hear, I find a new song that I like. Thank you Spotify for giving me the music I have and continuing this amazing app!!!!!"
Awesome UI/UX plus a lot of songs with lyrics ü§©
"been using the app for quite a while now and I'm absolutely in love with it because of a lot of great features, and customised playlists. But a recent problem I've been facing is with Spotify canvas. There's no option to turn it on. I've tried reinstalling as well but of no use which left me quite disappointed. But overall, love the app"
It is a good app For free music. Though I would like them to improve their UI a bit more.
This is the one of best song app in the world‚ò∫. All have requiest to rate this appüëçüëçüëç
Great music selections. Easy to use and build great music Playlist. Have recommended it to all my friends. Check it out.
"I've known this app for quite a long time but was never interested in using it but the moment I attempted making use of the app, I never looked back. The developers of the app did a great job in creating such a master piece of an app. No wonder it's the 1 streaming app in the US.üôå"
Works quite well for my musical needs and has been my favorite musicial app for years now!
"I've been using Spotify for over 5 years for a reason! It quick it's reliable, my only complaint is with no warning some songs are removed and I can no longer listen to them....üòë"
I love the ability to create my own playlists and finding some obscure songs in the process. I also like the fact that while building your list they will offer suggestions for your list that may help you find some new music.
I've had Spotify for quite a while now. I love it! It's my go to for my faves and searching for something different couldn't be any easier. $10 bucks a month and my umpteen playlists at my finger tips. Doesn't get any better than that. 100 stars!ü§©
"The best music application, i have premium with my family and its amazing, the new udpate with the lyrics is so good!! We have access to any music even unreleased and the app design is wonderful"
"Great music but some changes needed. Blocking a song that's far too easy, just under add to my list. So sometimes you accidentally hit the wrong button and the song ends up gone forever."
To be honest i love this app I would use it more if there was a way to quickly set up a long play list because youtube music I use more because it was set up before this. BTW love ‚ù§ üòç üíñ the way the music plays when I am on different apps and the lyrics don't get me started.
Please fix the widget. Spotify is brilliant but the android widget doesn't function like other like wise app widgets. Other apps the last thing played will remain on the widget for ever ready to be played at the the press of the play button. But Spotify widget will go blank after a small period of time and then is just another button to open the app in order to get the last thing played. Please fix this you will shave milliseconds off my day üòÇ üòÇ
"Very nice.....I love the app, tha app is cool in design and shows new playlist everyday And of the singers which we listen the most üëçüòç"
"Hands down, this app is apart from the crowd, and in so many ways better that other apps I've used. Such as Pandora, you tube, and others. Great job Spotify, as a artist and in appreciation, Spotify has made a masterpiece, a work of art, that had me entertained and captivated for hours and days on end. Sincerely, and genuinely, thank you Spotify and those that created, run, and operate Spotify. You're the best!!!!"
"The songs are quite complete, unfortunately I have to Premium . If you want to be free"
"Never used the app /service before, but now I want thanks to Joe Rogan n Spotify backbone regarding this whole controversy thing. If they came cuz it was built, now let them leave if so they choose, real family and friends stay behind and let the new follow and support. (After all, all is being Censored, Monetized, and Perverted.)"
Even though a few or a lot of people choose 1 star I believe that Spotify will become better and great I will still download this app even though people call it horrible don't judge quickly as I hope that the next update will be better 10/10
This is a amazing music app! It has my favorite songs! But the thing is it doesn't have download button pls put some....great app I'll give this a 5 star
Nice music and lots of choice to suit every occasion
I still find the songs I want quick & easy.
"okay I like spotify but stop adding songs to my playlist. -update 3 years later, spotify is sooo much better w premuim and tbh its so worth it"
Ditched Pandora years ago and I regret nothing. The ability to customize and share a Playlist while getting the intuitive experience of having music (I ACTUALLY like) suggested makes it top tier. I've even gone on to purchase a family plan to spread that same feeling to my family. Thank you for supporting so many artist (some of them close friends of mine) on your platform.
"Please bring back the quick scroll bar on the side for liked songs, It really helps"
"Great ui loved it, you should buy premium its worth the price, amazing app overall 9/10"
"Great app and really enjoy the music and building special playlists to enjoy. But word of advice for Spotify owners, stay neutral from politics. These are ugly times. Folks just want to listen to music or podcasts. If they don't like what they hear they simply can turn the channel to something they do like. Do not cave to a small percentage of those who think their policies and opinion should be the opinion of the whole. Freedom is what endures forever. That, and keeping the price low too ;)"
I like the minimal & simple UI. It enhances the overall experienceüëåüèª. But in the free version of the app the repeated ads are just annoying ü•¥üòêüòÖ.
Overall experience is quite good. Doesn't shows much ads. Song recommendations are good.
Amazing UI ! Love the suggestions!!
"I love driving and Spotify. Singing while going on road trip is life altering. And Spotify has favorites, liked song list, and music scrapped together for driving, or gaming, or exercising at gym. Even meditative sounding audio play. I truly enjoy Spotify the best from other site designers others the the tubers and all source's - Spotify is champ of musical reach. Thank you Spotify teams and people. Happy New Year's"
I really love the app. Very easy to use UI. There's almost no limit to the customization of playlists and your qeue. Overall an amazing experience
I enjoy that Spotify doesn't run my battery low quickly & I can listen to Spotify while browsing the world wide web & I can turn screen off and Spotify continues to play while I exercise to my saved playlist.
"Joe Rogan is an intelligent & intuitive interviewer. He is a very good listener, enabling him to develop & engage in deep conversations with a variety of guests on a wide range of topics. There will always be people who disagree with one another. We have unique experiences & bring our individual perspectives to interpret those experiences. It is the young child who takes his ball & leaves the game when he can't have his way. Please don't give childish behavior the power to censor others."
"I've been using the premium subscription for years. I've never had issues with the apps, and generally find their updates to be intuitive. I live in South Korea and while some older songs are still romanized, most have the lyrics in Korean. It is frustrating that you can't change the language settings in the app, it follows the language your phone is in. But to me the music quality, quantity and download options make up for it. Overall a nice service that's worth the price."
I am so grateful for this app and its service but it would be SO MUCH BETTER if you could add a song to multiple playlists at once not just one at a time that's super annoying and seems obvious UI to me so PLEASE add this simple feature then 5 million stars!!!
Im specially after UI in every app. Spotify is so friendly and looks amazing. If there a option to hide and show the current playing music by swipe up and down would be very usefull. :)
It's great only if paid...apple music can be cheaper than this...but app experience and UI is so much better...but would hope to have more control over audio quality/ bitrate
I love this app but I'm having problems with one of the newer updates. They finally added the lyrics feature to almost all songs but I have yet to see it work on any of the songs that claim they have lyrics available. I have checked all guides and nothing seems to be working... Just a tad dissapointed.
I wish I could listen to music without the internet... it doesn't give a lot of hints either when your looking for new artists or songs. But it's super quick in finding exactly the song I'm looking for. A plus.
"Once you find a song you like, you can click the three dots (related actions button) and start a ""Radio"" that will play similar songs. Best feature in my opinion. I give it 5 mics."
So far past month been using it and comparing with Apple music. It's not bad... I like how it connects with my alexa and car. The UX feel is good and able to navigate around fine. I do like how I can switch devices to play music which is convenient.
Using Spotify for years now and I have never enjoyed a music app quite like this!
"Overall, the app is good. Gives good recommendations, and doesn't have so many ads. However, the premium individual plan is too expensive. Instead, we can buy Amazon Prime, JioSaavn or other apps which are cheaper. The app also doesn't allow to share lyrics with a share button using default Android's share feature. The app only had support to share lyrics in apps like WhatsApp, Instagram etc. It should also have support for Signal Messanger."
"The app is good. I can play all the songs I want. And no adds, the songs continuing to play."
i have an undying love for spotify. nothing else quenches my thirst for music quite like this. i am Happy.
"Once updated, Spotify is the greatest music app I've ever used! I love the intuitive playlists crafted for you based off your listening to just a few vsongs - very unique!"
Add equilizer like MX player. Sound Equilizer is in setting it might be in music dashboard to use it easily.
Would definitely recommend üëå it is a very good music platform the only problem is that it doesn't have all the songs you look for it might not have some covers or clean versions other than that I was quite happy with it
One of the best and helpful compliment... Dot see any bugs..! I am talking inside this app ads are very closed in after 1/2 songs but it's possible because ussage world wide and feels like a genuine....... !!!!!
"improve UI make it easy to follow artists, or to play radio based on a song or artist, etc."
"I quite like the student discount they provided :) Great functionality, and is user friendly."
"I changed from 1 star to 5 for supporting and standing by your content creators. I have also seen improvements in the functionality of the app. Please continue to allow free speech and freedom to express different viewpoints. If you work for Spotify and don't agree know that just because you don't like something doesn't mean you get to force censorship on everyone else. The minute you get what you want we all lose. STFU or quit, that's your right, nothing else."
"I love this app because I can make unlimited playlists, share them with friends, and explore new music! Spotify quickly learned my music taste and never fails to deliver!"
"i like spotify alot but it looks different and i dont have the button to see the lyrics or have the album cover on the screen while on other webites (im on computer) but when i log into my other account its the same with all the stuff that i dont have and i know its because of an update but i really liked those features and now their gone, ALSO it keeps switching to toehr playlist while im listening like the playlist based on the one that im listening to and its kinda annoying and it plays the s"
"Been using this for several years now and just love it. Easy, intuitive, makes great playlists easy, trending lists to suit your listening styles etc. Can't imagine life without this (and DIFM) ."
I have been using it since 2010 and haven't had a problem with it related to the app itself. Just realised how cool and intuitive App this is when I had to stop using it for a couple of month due to a problem with my credit card and had to use YouTube ... that's when I realised how much I missed Spotify *‚Ä¢*
"Ads are quite intrusive . Sometimes after watching a 30 second ad , when I shouldn't have to see another ad for half an hour , I get another ad after a few minutes, which should not be the case. The Equalizer should be made available in a more easily accessible menu instead of the settings , as I have to go back to the app home page, go to settings , scroll down and then click on the Equalizer option to access it , which is quite cumbersome and unnecessary ."
"Being the ubiquitous music listening experience of today it's a given that it works pretty well, but recently I'm having problems with it playing what I actually want. The other day I wanted to switch from an album to the next, and after every song it went back to the previous one. Just today, I couldn't play the first song of my daily mix. I'd guess there are tests for at least this functionality.. also, where's Spotify hifi still?"
"Like Spotify under Family plan, also love the UI interface but the audio quality is bad specially for rock/heavy metal music, after 4 years using Spotify, I finally switched to YouTube Music and the quality audio is amazing, specially on the car."
Spotify is a user friendly app that preforms excellent. I am very happy to support their product and I will be continuing to use their app.
"Enjoyed the Spotify Premium service in particular. My most sincere complements and thanks to all of the very talented staff there at Spotify. You can tell much thought went into even the most minute detail. Spotify staff truly love what they do and in doing so, they show how much respect and genuine care they have for their customers."
Cool app. And with the latest update I can add some good 70s folk rock into my mix without having to worry about pressing the skip button every time Joni Mitchell starts caterwauling about clouds or SCIENCE!‚Ñ¢ or some such nonsense.
App is really well designed and intuitive. Music and podcasts sound fantastic. Brilliant experience all around.
"This App doesn't songs from most of my favorite bands e.g. Linkin Park, Avenged Sevenfold and most of the Rock bands . Also it doesn't have all the Indian regional songs. Btw the User Interface is quite great but my only concern is the inadequate collection of songs. I expect Spotify to expand there collection if they want to succeed in the Indian Market. Thank you."
"Very easy to use. Spotify makes Playlists suited to your music tastes, mood, occasions, activities, etc. Ads are infrequent and short. I highly recommend this app!"
"Love the App. The last update caused a glitch. After I play, say a podcast, and the close the app. When I re-open, the built in player does not come up. The podcast continues where I left off, but I have no way to pause etc, because the player isn't visible. I've uninstalled and re-installed to see if that would fix the ""glitch"", but no luck.To get it back, I need to restart my phone, or do a force stop on the app.Don't know if anyone else is having the same issue? FYI - MY Phone is a Galaxy S10+, fully updated."
Simple and inviting! Nothing counter intuitive to confuse anyone who needs a music platform. For gen x and before the idea of the latest interfaces is intimidating at the very least. You've exceeded greatly though simplicity and by adding nothing superfluous. Thanks.
App is quite amazing. One thing that I pick other apps over Spotify e.g YT music is the amount of music it contains that you can't find anywhere in Spotify. Over all great app tho
A very reliable App. Helps me find the gospel songs quickly and contains songs i would not be able to find easily usibg other Apps. Thankyou Sporify.
"Spotify is by far the best music streaming app I have ever used. From the simplicity and easy to use UI to a whole array of all the music you need tailored to fit you perfectly. The algorithms suggestions for new music are splendid and bring you closer to new music. All in all, 9/10 app. 9 coz i am certain there is a lot more to come as they work up to 10"
Love this app so much. Have been using it a lot more since December as I got 6 months free Spotify Premium as a benefit when I got my Samsung phone in October. Will be continuing with premium (but paid of course) once the 6 months free of charge Premium ends. So happy that local files option is now on Android phones aswell as on desktop version. Keep up the amazing experience. Thank you Spotify üëå
"It's a convenient service, but the app has some very frustrating issues. Some things are very slow to load, as if it's a connection issue (sometimes when trying to open an options menu it tells me to go online, despite my being very much online already), but this is quite persistent and no other apps have a connection problem. There's no reason why seeing my own downloads or opening a menu to set a sleep timer should even need a connection in the first place"
"A world of amazing music across the decades at my fingertips, only thing that worries me is how little payment the artistes recieve. Guilty conscience is the only thing that looses the app one star from me."
Everything is fine but Equilizer option should near player options but it is in the settings. We need to follow very long path just to enable equilizer. I think that is only wrost part of this app.
"Great app and love the fact that Spotify actually will take time and use some technical thing they have, a simple thing that can see what type of music I like no matter how diverse my playlists and then recommend sons/ artists I may also like. Something other music apps haven't quite managed to master. I also like the fact that as long as the low subscription is up to date, I can still listen to my fave tunes without internet connection that's great as my commute in mainly underground"
"On my previous phone (iphone) the UI was way smother. A lot of seamless swipes instead of abrupt buttons to close pages etc. I just wish that the Android version will have some UI changes and smoother experience, just like the iOS one. Another example is are the way the (album) colors & the color around the album cover when playing an album are treated on Android, kinda muted and less ""poppy"" compared to iOS."
"This is by far one of the best apps. The ui is sleek, suggestions work great , my family has no problem with paying the relatively small cost of the family premium membership (which covers our 4 accounts), great music selection, I've started listening to some podcasts. And it is just overall a solid app. The only problem I have with it would be how much space its takes up, but with how much I use it that's worth it"
"I'm giving Spotify 5 stars because it's one of my favorite apps. However, I'd suggest adding a feature to confirm if a user is sure when deselecting the ""download"" button on playlists. I accidentally did that the other day and had to download a whole 2 gb Playlist over again. Which sucks because data is expensive in my country."
Good app however there are some problems when I'm skipping through a song it sometimes doesn't skip to that part and I have to try again it isn't that major but still quite annoying I know it isn't cause my WiFi is slow since its 500mbps
UI could be more organized & intuitive. Otherwise not bad. But if I'm paying I expect MORE. Like never having to deal with seeing the wrong title playing at the bottom & staying stuck like that for hours! Also sudden stops for no reason! (Îàà‚Ä∏Îàà)
"As a DJ and music connoisseur, this app allows me to store, play, and discover not only my favorite tracks but also my future favorite tracks. It is like having the ultimate record collection without the debt or storage space required physically or digitally. Spotify rocks!!!"
"I would put five stars, and I have had this app for quite a while and I haven't had a problem until TODAY. My music keeps cutting out in the middle of the songs. So can I hear a solution soon please, so I can fix this problem? Or is there going to be an update soon?"
"Update: They brought back the ‚è™‚èØ‚è© AND driving mode. üíôüòÅ ‚Ä¢ 3/'21: Love Spotify. Had it for many years on PC. Would give 5 ‚òÜs if Spotify would include itself and the ‚è™‚èØ‚è© buttons on the drop down notification bar on Androids for quicker access to them like it used to. It was b/c of this feature that I deleted other apps. Having to minimize all apps to reopen Spotify app, and then reopen the track just to get the ‚è™‚èØ‚è© menu is a bummer... I need this feature back please."
"Moved over from amazon music after amazon just wouldn't play my extensive playlists over the alexa and also just on an aux in my car. Utterly frustrating when there long drives to be had to university and its my only alone time away from 2 kiddos, self care in important. Spotify has worked perfectly, the tracks it recommends are on point after only using it for a month it's got my taste down to a tea. Really user friendly, even my 5 and 9 year old can make their own playlists."
"Good app with heaps of good features but its not quite perfect. Often the app double downloads albums in my library so I have manually remove them, it freezes often enough to get irritating on all devices I have and I sometimes have to reinstall the app because of random glitches. When those issues ain't happening spotify is great but they do."
"I LOVE THIS APP, (I have Spotify premium) and it has made my experience 10 times better, just listening to my favourite songs in high res without any interruptions feels like heaven and not to mention this app definitely has 95% of songs on the planet so that's cool, I love Spotify wrapped aswell, makes me feel special Lol. the ui is top notch! Getting used to audio books on there aswell nowadays, it's way better than I thought, worth it if you aren't using the free plan"
I enjoy the way theymake up lists for me. They are quite accurate in what they choose. I am an elderly person and like 40s popular and classical music and they pick out music that i didn't know about. It is well worth having.
Thank you for being ethical and considerate of your users. I like the app coz the commercials are noninvasive like YouTube. Plus the interface is nicely designed and suggestions are very relevant. Highly recommended üëç Keep up the good job
Its very good its just that you guys removed the feature were we can see the songs and now we can only see the names and I hate how the shuffle button is with like the play button I am not saying it's bad but I would like it to be back it's fine if not since it's not that big of a Problem
I just love Spotify because of the best blues selection I can get and also I can practice my guitar through the backtrack options it allows me to enjoy practice and listening to.
Has a music lover. This app is good and huge collection of music but one thing is about adds .Spotify broadcast same adds repeatedly please change adds after one by one and make some long gape between two adds it's comes quickly soo please solve itü§óü§óü§ó
"After a update some time ago, the buttons on the notification are always black even when the song has black background. It's annoying but not deal breaking. The other issue is when I change songs on another device with my phone, the song changes but on the phone it gets stuck on timestamp 0.01 and the buttons to change songs stop working. Then I have to go back and forth between the main menu and song display to change them. Other than that it works."
Always solid audio quality very few glitches to the app and when there are any glitches they seem to fixed them quickly! Also daily mixes are the best thing ever! And plenty of podcasts if that's more your avenue
"Experience is good. Good UI, only problem is, if you're not on an auto-renewal subscription, when it ends, all the downloaded songs get deleted even after you subscribe again."
"Very good overall, never had any major problems. couple of minor issues like songs (very rarely) continuing in silence after they finish, but that could just be a glitch caused by my bad internet lol"
UX could be improved a bit - I don't wanna wait one second every time I click on the 3-dots icon for the song options. Spotify checks for an active internet connection just to grey out some options from that menu and it ruins the experience. AND THIS HAPPENS EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE OFFLINE MODE ENABLED!
"Spotify is the best music app i've tried, it's really easy to use and has a lot of recommended playlists that spotify makes, and music that you can explore, and the app is easy to use. even if a lot of people say there are a lot of ads and can't play the music they like because of the new update, just pay for spotify it's really cheap and you'll find spotify easier to use when you pay for it. i use spotify everyday from day to night, i thank everyone who built spotify and everyone who manages it"
"For some reason while I have updated the app, I still don't have the ""share"" button to post lyrics. And this is on my account only because when I log onto other accounts, the ""share"" button is available."
"Honestly didn't like it at first but in my opinion,it's subscription is affordable to most and I love the offline dowlading options. I also like how it builds playlists based on my taste in music and Spotify wrapped is cool. I'm sure their are better options but Spotify is easy to use and has never shown itself to be a bad app."
"Spotify is awesome as a service. I literally signed up because of Joe Rogan. I've been thinking about it ever since Rogan and Spotify signed their deal, but their adherence to their contract despite controversy sealed the deal. The user interface for the app isn't exactly intuitive. It is challenging to get back and forth into the queue versus a play list versus an album that I'm looking at. I would maybe suggest multiple tabs that are easy to access."
"New to this. So easy to use. Loving building my library with a variety of media. Would like to see more female writers in the audio book menu. Family package is excellent. I'm not all that fussed about the digital world, but I'm really engaging with Spotify I am enjoying having easy access to my favourite artists and listening to new stuff based in Spotify's recommendations."
Great app but songs of different languages should have English lyrics. And it has so many ads it's really annoying and it ruins mood .
Just glad that the lyrics feature is back on the roll after a very long time. Moreover the little ui tweaks day by day is also great and enhances the experience than what it was before. Happy to be a premium member and keep up with the minimal great changes :)
"I wish the app had a ranking and review button, none of the apps has this feature. This will make easy to listening to podcast, some music such as hypnosis etc. Keep this feature free if implemented."
"Great sound quality, easy to make playlists, wear os app is also nice but it requires being connected to phones spotify. Though premium is pretty much required, and some smaller artists I can find on soundcloud/youtube/bandcamp aren't available on spotify, but most of what I listen is available. Trying with a trial of premium atm, considering starting to pay for it mainly because the sound quality is way better than other apps I use. Btw you need to set quality in settings for best quality."
"The service in general is very good. The app itself is too bare. An option to create a personalised library of favourite albums that looks like the one in Poweramp would be great. The integration with Sonos and Chromecast is very bugged, lots of disconnections or hang ups that force me to force quit and restart the app. Recently I'm starting to dislike the black and green theme too. I would rather have the option to change it to a classic black text on a white background."
"This app is amazing, ƒ∞ always listen to music from here. However the adverts are irritating, ƒ∞t is about alcohol and other things that are totally not suitable for me. It also says says ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" but literally ten minutes later I see two adverts."
"It pauses itself in between songs until I turn my screen on or press the button, been happening for over a week now and never happened before. BUG."
"It would be incredible if you guys could figure out a better layout for the 'now playing' song part for tablets. (You know, the one with the lyrics and play/pause buttons.) Something like putting the lyrics on one side of the screen and the play/pause buttons on the other side. Left and right. Guys, it would be nice if we had the ability to check the 'date of release' of songs."
"Since the last update, it's been quite glitchy. The screen won't show what current song/podcast is playing, it will show the last one I was listening to. At times it would also stop playing when my screen would go black. Other than that I love Spotify."
"üôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩ. It is relatively less costly, gives you lyrics, consumes less data, and the app has classic graphics. It is actually the best music streaming app. Thank you Spotify."
"Absolutely some of the best content out there in one place. A little quirky in the operational side of things, but the content cones through with patience and its worth it."
"Everything about this app is brilliant! I only have one complaint. I experience it quite annoying, now with the new ""enhance"" function that I have to find the song in my playlist to delete it, rather then just simply be able to delete the song through the ""play"" window."
"The app is pretty good only when you have premium, because as child I couldn't pay to get premium so instead I just had to deal with two ads that would be 1 minute long and if you're lucky 30 seconds which I wouldn'tmind if they weren'tso frequent, something else is that you can't actually choosewhat songs you can play since you'reonly option is the shuffle button. I would only recommend if you're willing to pay for premium."
Best app for songs and the most thing I loved in Spotify is its UI its is very easy and so nice üòç but the only one negative is its playing often the ads if we play one song also it will play first ads and next only it will play the song and after two songs played it will ads again....üòë Spotify please reduce ur ads
"App keeps stucking. It lags since 1 month while music keeps playing in the background. EDIT- Above lagging problem is solved now. But the app keeps leaving network condition by its own. Please check this issue. My phone's new and network operator is also quite good. Then, i will consider for 4 or 5 stars as well."
This is absolutely amazing!! I have switched from YouTube/YT Music to this and have absolutely no reason to look back (or elsewhere) for music! It is easy and intuitive and I haven't found a song I wanted to hear who's is unavailable.
Not as many ads as their competition and the playlists are intuitive and filled with new discoveries (and a few walks down memory lane too!)
"If you had more stars I would give them to you. I like it. I was looking for a specific music genre Christian County, and wow lo and behold there it was. The only thing that would make it even better, a random mix button."
"Plenty of musical options and thousands of hours of amazing podcasts, but the best part is how quickly the algorithm learns what you like and gives you what you didn't even know you wanted. Check it out you will not be disappointed."
"i really really love this app, especially the 1 week premium fiture. spotify rarely crash in my devices, and oh god their costumer service are very kind and take the responsibilty so quickly, they help me solve my problem in just a night. keep it up! and lastly i hope spotify can make something like customizable Home Screen so it can be more comfortable and fun to use."
"First time user and I like it better than pandora, at work pandora just keep on buffering until it gets connected and then is ok, Spotify connects to my phone and portable devices very quick and I like the music selection and the daily playlists. I don't have a premium subscription yet but will see what happens in the near future."
"I love Spotify so much, but sometimes it says its offline when my Internet is working fine. I would also prefer when you click on the 3 dots next to a song to see more options (like add to playlist or queue) that once I'm done it doesn't automatically close that window as often I want to add the song to multiple playlists without having to click too many times üòÖ. Adding a back button from this screen would be helpful!!"
"Still in 3 months trial, so far so good, im very happy with the quality and performance online and offline üí™üí™üí™. Greetings from Malaysia. Tried Youtube Music but i prefer Sportify due to the easy user experience. Highly recommended"
"My son, 30 years younger, showed me Spotify. Apple and Amazon drove me away from their players. I don't mind Spotify's subscription fee if musicians get paid and the app doesn't get to grabby. I listen to Spotify about 10 hours / week with ear buds, a JBL Flip 4 or my car's radio bluetooth connection. I'm frequently out of cell range and like being able to save music to my phone for (in car) listening. The app is useable and sounds good. I'm rebuilding my music collection here."
Unmatched streaming and recommendations. Quick downloads and recently played music plays uninterrupted even on listing internet. The voice command feature Hey Spotify does not work.
Spotify is my go to music app and I love the new update! Now I don't accidentally hit shuffle on my playlists since they moved the shuffle button to the side. No complaints on this appüòÅ
"The new update got worsen than before, before was the album bug, then this one, when I transfer to SD card, all downloaded playlists didn't play at all. Kindly fix the app, subcription is quite yet the app didn't meet that standard."
"Music keeps playing over phone calls. The lock screen function buttons sometimes disappear. The app thinks I'm offline and refuses to search, even when i am not. Browsing through the app is not straight forward, and it requires a long time to load pages - this is not a limitation of my phone."
"It's doing everything I want it to, intuitively and with ease.I did the 3 month free trial and when it's over, I can't imagine getting rid of it. I'm super frugal, but this is the bees knees."
"I was quite amazed about the range of music available in Spotify,even old songs than are not found in other apps now , this is the great app I ever download."
"It's good for a free user. However, the ads are a little too much and quite long. Consider making it 2 ads at once instead of 3 long ones at once"
"I love this app, i can listen music what i want without downloading (im not using premium), but... the problem is i dont like it because there a Advertisement its ruin my mood, but i still love it this app its makes me heal,happy and enjoy listening music and podcast and that's it thanks you Sorry if you don't understand and it's not clear (‚úø ‚ô°‚Äø‚ô°)"
"I find this app usefull but it is quite annoying when random ""suggested songs"" are added into your playlist. I think there should be an option to allow suggested songs or not. Overall, the app is very easy to use."
"I love the variety of music i can listen to and how i can go to different apps without my music shutting down, quite convenient when i want to multitask"
"Do something about the latest update, it's killing any love I had for this app. I get the wrong song displayed on my lock screen and widgets and when I hit skip, it'll jump back a few songs and ruin the queue! I use spotify connect through the echo dot and it worked great for ages, but I'm honestly close to cancelling my subscription and going elsewhere at this point, I'd rather have to change CD's after every album than have to go to the app and find the song I was up to when it cut me off."
"This is a musical garden of eden. My ears have never experienced such serotonin. While the app is quite greedy it is fine due to the amazing sounds it produces. Not only does it have awestriking albums and songs, it also has amazing podcasts of which i like to listen to. It is like rain but if it where speaking beautiful words in your ear. I almost want to cry when i listen to my playlist pepe popo. The. Podcasts are not just funny or people taking their thoughts on controversy,yet also stories"
Hie do you even reorder playlists in 2021 now? Are we regressing in terms of UX? Why is there no song multiselect? Please look at all the features audio players of early 2010s provided.
"Thanks...a very good soul company , glad it does not require another login and password for every access as most other apps do , during the course of last two months due to my international travel arrangement I have had to install at least 35 apps and each was asking you to be unique and with combinations of UpperLowerNumSpecialASCIIset....$+$:21615,#'7':,#dsyeiwndyfwy..."
Overall nice app üëç with no lag. Please put button 'Remove song' 'Remove playlist' and 'Remove podcast' again in the recently played section of Spotify app on both platforms Android and PC.
"I love music, and I've been playing guitar for 33 years now. Spotify just works for me. I find all the great guitarist that inspired me, and get to listen anytime üòä. It's worth $9.99 a month to me!!!!"
"There are issues but honestly the UI, selection, radio, and service is so vastly beyond any other offering that it's easy to overlook."
Every bit of music at the touch of a button. Especially with my different play lists and choices. Great for the entire family!!!
Been using since 2019(premium). Totally worth it. The vast music database and the UI support even to devices with weak compatibility just does it for me.
"Lately the app on both Win and Android is very laggy and slow, full of bugs and interruptions, songs are jamming, play button won't do nothing for minutes although the internet connection is good; while songs are being downloaded by the app the wifi connection in the phone and sometimes the app too are unusable. Also the correlation between desktop and phone app is a mess lately, the play controls disappears completely on the phone while listening on the pc etc. Once a light app, not anymore"
"Have had Spotify for a good few months now, it's alot less problematic and far less prone to breakdowns to the main competition, (the biggest river in Brazil!,) Infact there's no comparing the two. Spotify is a country mile ahead in every respect. Spotify is the yardstick by which others must be measured, all of whom have a good way to go. Spotify is a great app with clever intuitive features to explore ones own music genre's, very well thought out, and very nicely designed."
"Spotify is fluid, lucid and so easy to use and understand. I like getting my music, podcasts and more in such a well thought out platform. Thanks Spotify!"
"I like this application, it suits me very well especially the playlist recommendations which is somehow arranged correctly for me. All the songs are free to listen to, however this app has 2 problems for me First. (probably) I have to pay a premium to download the song. Second. This app takes up a lot of space on my device. Well that's it from my review, thank you üôÇ"
"Surpassed my expectations in many ways than one. Well designed, access to millions of songs just at a click of a button indeed, life has never been so joyous with your rhythms."
"It's a good a app for streaming songs but, after every two songs, it starts showing unskipable ads and it seriously ruins the mood. Please reduce the amount of ads you show, Spotify."
"For listening to music, I don't go beyond Spotify. On of the best in buisness. It has some flaws like- lyrics don't show when I bought premium, idk why? But overall the best app for both music and podcast too. And its premium is worth it... üåüüåü Spotify team, continue to improve... Love your app."
"Nice, but many songs are not available yet üòï, please add them ASAP and make some UI changes in the app, it fellas like old days app. Otherwise I've nothing to say about this application. Hope app developers will work on it soon."
"Easily the greatest and most important app on my phone, without a doubt. I don't think an optional new UI would go unnoticed I think it would be a good edition. I also think a feature to highlight obscure and less popular music should be implemented, otherwise perfect app well done guys!"
"Spotify HAS Completely Changed the way I Experience Music! FREE is MORE than FINE by ME. I used to listen to Pandora ONLY due to their ease. W/O affording the $9.99 a month, I Couldn't happily continue Pandora with the ADS during times of concentration. Meditation. Quiet time then boom some blaring AD. Since allotting myself time to understand the simplicity in its usability I have taken my music experience to the NEXT LEVEL. THANKS SPOTIFY @justcarmia"
Definitely the best streaming service for music. Lots of quality of life features like Spotify Connect and Wrapped. The new addition of lyrics for every song is also very helpful. The app itself is very clean and well designed with no bugs even on the Galaxy Z Fold 3. Take my money!
Spotify provides listeners with an assortment of music experience that's tailored to their needs! The GUI is super cool and you even have lyrics to sing along. Thanks for bein awesome Spotty :)
"I like this music streaming app the most because you get to listen to other user's public playlists. Regular people are usually better at picking music than persons acting as corporations are, so I like that Spotify is okay letting me hear what other people like too. I also like Spotify's song queuing method. Good job, Spotifolks!"
A great app which just keeps getting better. Nice touch with the 2021 review aswell. Would be nice to have 1) Always accessable fast access to equaliser. 2) multiple equaliser presets. 3) Instantly save all types of radios & rename as playlist 4) quicker way of linking to artists/ albums. 5) Resume where left off as an option. 6) New daily recommended from similar genre listeners. 7) find out how donations will benefit the artists work. 8) Any info artist wants to add about the recordings. =:--)
"It is a exquisite app, but the ads are unbearable. Would like to have limited ads to keep the music going on, and on. However, mobile version of spotify needs updating; you cant click any songs and it plays, it plays it in shuffle on mobile. Overall, it is a great app."
"The only problem I have is that sometimes music I don't want on my playlist are played. If I build a playlist, just play the music on the list. Forcing music I don't like or don't want is really annoying"
Thank you for designing this app.My day doesn't end without this app. I like how the app suggets next songs based on Junro of the songs we listen. Amazing new features at the end of year!!
"While my telephone is on dark mode, i have some problems with Spotify. For example, stop-start button doesn't work correctly, i can't see whether the music open or not. And also, all of the albums, except for black ones, seem black. I can't see their exact colour. I like Spotify but it would be better if there weren't these problems."
"I really like Spotify, but I don't really like the layout of it, if I change my music preferences, I can't just click a button in the app. Or like how I in other music apps I could just block an artist or a genre"
"Free version: Shuffle playing was quite ok for a free user but the fact featured ads are misleading deserves a downgrade of one star ‚Äî talking about the mini plan nor free 1 or 3-month premium but payment via mobile isn't available. Nevertheless, I just wanted to experience it. Even asked for help but didn't resolve either. Maybe some time if I had my credit. Best experience so far even with a free account"
"Spotify has quality service and even when you're offline, you get the pleasantries of music. The various things Spotify has to offer are what attracted me so quickly. I didn't get premium until a year ago and I would never go back. There is a bigger difference than you think and the 7-day trial is worth it."
"I have used many Music and podcast apps for past few years, Spotify is the only app that has a clean UI and a plethora of podcasts. Price might be on higher side compared to other apps in India , but its worth it."
"A friendly reminder: it would be quite great if Spotify had a toggle mode for regional music. For instance, if I live in Russia it doesn't really mean I want to see only Russian music and podcasts. Moreover, I don't want to see them due to some personal preferences."
"Wish there was a quicker way to add songs to playlists. Also, wish it was easier to manage podcasts. Still the best music service though."
"This much power to listen to virtually any song ever recorded -even in the car- is almost too much lol! I even used it to calm my son who was in a lot of pain as I took him for an emergency procedure. Music is the soundtrack of life, and Spotify make it easy to customize to any situation on the fly, or quickly download an entire Playlist or album in seconds!"
"For me, Spotify is the best app for listening music, Probably because I have premuim, but you can listen to any song, and make playlists, I have alot of liked songs and its easy to find a song you like, I reallly like Spotify and it is highly reccomended"
"At first I wasn't too sure about the app, but it quickly starts to know what you like and give you great suggestions. I found music that I forgot about and found great new music. Really enjoying it! Would definitely recommend. Just wish we can get 360 reality music on this app soon."
"This is a great app I love it, it's easy to use and it has the songs I love to listen to ‚ò∫Ô∏èthe only problem it has it the shuttle and repeat button keeps going away and that's so annoying üôÑ I wish they would fix it other then that the app is great üòÜ 10/10 would recommend"
"Hurrah! They've changed the 'Play' button back to normal after the experiment with making 'shuffle' its default action, with no option to change it, in spite of the many genres and the spoken word content that need to be heard in order, and in spite of the thought & care that go into album programming. Spotify is once again a very decent music app, attached to one of the best music libraries around, making the sub terrific value. I like the facility to 'cast' music to Chromecast, which I expect I will love once the software allows Chromecast to respect the Autoplay setting on the controlling app."
Definitely my most used app. I love how you can add your own artwork to playlists and put them in folders. Love Spotify üñ§. Only thing I would add is a play button on folders for mobile users so we can shuffle multiple playlists from the phone app. Currently the only way to do this is through the desktop version.
"we need previous & next buttons on the mini playback bar on the bottom of the app. & a section for random songs of different genres we might like, to start streaming. & make your recommendation algorithm more scary accurate."
"Spotify is the worst first person shooter game, blogging platform, live video stream and Pok√©mon app I have ever used but as a repository for music and a music player... It's intuitive and useful. I do wish they'd pay their artists more. That would be the difference for me between a 4 and 5 is a truly just version of the app."
"I have great experience with spotify, although the problem being random pauses. It's annoying especially since it ruins my vibe. Hope this gets a fix."
"Since the last updated you added a ton of bugs. While casting on another device the screen just freezes and it's saying that is not playing anything, although it is and when it says is playing just keeps getting stuck to the first song of the playlist to 0:00, it's very frustrating. I've recently acquired the premium membership since I didn't liked the usability when you first launched, I sticked with YouTube music but as I said until last updated since I got premium I actually enjoyed it."
"I could never understand why they didnt add lyrics in app, and now they have its 5 stars from me, 15 quid for a family pass giving you 5 accounts to endless music. As a physical media fan, i have to admit, its pretty amazing. Adding HQ and Atmos music would make it unbeatable."
"It's awesome and complete. Podcast, lyrics, offline playback(wish you could keep those even when your subscription ends.) The precise daily mix that actually suits your music taste. All the genres of music, the latest releases from your favorite artists... It's all here. Plus the subscription isn't too pricey. It's actually decent.üëåüèº Kudos team. Don't slack! Keep it up.üíØüî•üí™üèº"
The app is now working quite properly. Most bugs from the last update have been fixed. But I haven't done the last update yet (and I probably won't). It seems to be keeping up quite nicely especially with the cache management during the no-internet times. I personally still don't like the new widget but that's a different story. I thought it was temporary to be honest. In the overall the app went back to its glory And did a very well job with the musicmatch implementation.
"Awesome UI! However, I don't know why songs lyrics isn't still available across board. Edit: Lyrics feature was launched globally, and guess what? I switched! All round app for me üíØ"
"I L O V E I T ! Especialy the new lyrics option! I was happy like a little kid when I saw that little button :-) Now, there is one more thing to upgrade, and it IMPORTANT - you need to add some animated screensaver for TV users, cause new generation TVs shouldn't have still picture for long time. If I leave Spotify for a couple of hours, there are shadows on the screen on the place where the album image is on Spotify. That is a small thing for devs and huge for users :-) Thanks for great app!"
"Choppy when u have other apps open with it running in background and if it isn't choppy it's skipping like ur listen to a cd... Which defeats the purpose of the app for me.... Yesh at least this 3 months is free cause I will NOT be continuing subscription if I can't play one song completely threwwww üò§üò§ & it is buffering while my apple music app has already searched//found//dowloaded song AND is already playing it on loseless Audio, and all I see is the buffering light bouncing still on ur app"
"As an update, everything's all good now! UI and UX are even smoother than before! Thank you Spotify for fixing those! I am planning to get Spotify Premium now on üòä üôè"
"App works as intended now, however still no hifi support which is rather disappointing considering apple added it out of the blue without any promises before hand. Now Spotify is the only service without even CD quality audio steaming. Still the best in terms of experience from a ui perspective and for discovering new music and recommendations"
"I have used Spotify since they required an invitation (yes, you used to need an invitation)! I love it love it love it. I do wish certain suggestions would be considered (adding BPM, making private listening default, etc) but otherwise love it."
"The current collection of songs is underwhelming and pales in comparison to other competitors like Saavn and Wynk. A lot of songs are simply not available, for instance Twenty One Pilots, Mayday Parade's new album etc. That being said, the overall integration across all your devices including Linux makes Spotify a clear winner. 4/5 Update: Massively improved quality of life improvements alongwith an increased song library and the competitive pricing. 5/5"
"Found a bug, may be caused by the old phone of mine, but anyway. Blackview BV7000, when i get to second ""stories"" (sometimes earlier) from ""wrapped"" Spotify just stops. The app is quite cool though"
"Use it daily, and in general I love it. One quirk I noticed - sometimes if I skip ads, podcast resets back to the start. Doesn't happen often though."
"I love spotify. Been paying for premium the past 6 years(and the free hulu subscription) Its worth the 10 bucks a month for endless playlist, shuffle button, daily mixes, etc. I have a Playlist that is 123 hours long... and about 15 others that make up every genre a person needs."
App is just wonderful ... But I would like to suggest improvement that need immediate action. Lyrics feature for both android and fire tv versions requires improvement.
"I love Spotify it's design, it's organization, it's content, podcasts, artists, playlists, etc reason only 4 stars sometimes ads are a bit much, I like the ""watch this video and get 1/2 hr ad free"" 2 15 second commercials ever 15 minute would also be ok"
"Great experience with spotify for over a yaer now, and the main thing is its mighty algorithms that always know what you want and when you want. I find ""discover weekly"" very accurate, it almost always gives me what i want, and so i always have something new to listen. The price for premium accaunt in my region is very reasonable and i appreciate that. App has also a solid design."
"Pretty good. There are some nuisances, and the suggested music can be lacking in variety, but it is free so no complaints."
The best music app ever.. The UI is cool and the mind blowing feature of creating a playlist inspired from the kind and pattern of music you listen to is just mind blowing. Just hope it is not some serious bug tracking s**t
"Everything is great, but I don't like that the poadcasts switch episodes when u swipe. Make some lock button also a seach bar to seach episodes. Thanks"
"I've been using this for a few days, I love it. It plays with the screen off, it has all the songs I want and everything. I do recommend a button where you can shuffle your playlist, I haven't seen one, but it might be on premium or something idk but I don't like listening to the same things in the same order Everytime."
"Dear Spotify team, there are some Spotify UI issue happening in Xiaomi smartphone.... 1. Play and pause button become complete white 2. During play the time indication not sync with song And some little bugs..."
"I absolutely love this app. I enjoy quite a lot using it by listening my favorite songs and artists BUT I don't understand why the lyrics doesn't appear on my screen, there's no even the option and I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but I'd like to have them as any other person, so that's why I'm giving you 4 stars until this issue is solved."
"I love the design and features of Spotify, the way it allows you to view your friend's activity and how they categories profile, artist, album, and etc. It just saved alot of our time. ALWAYS SPOTIFY"
"Been with Spotify for years and the app has gotten better. But I don't understand why Spotify changed the way ""Your Library"" loads. It was perfect the way it was before.... Now I have to add a filter just to see my playlists. Extremely counterintuitive."
"I dont like the fact that Spotify in the African region, at least Kenya, strips off some functionality. Like the Canvas and Lyrics in the paid version . That really sucks Spotify.... Also quite buggy in how the app connects to the internet even in very stable connections Other than those two qualms, I absolutely love the app"
"In a phrase, there is nothing I cannot do with the music I love using this application. I love the music ranging from the 30s through the 70s, and amazingly, I have found every song that I wanted from that era. I find that quite remarkable considering that some of this music is almost 100 years old when it was originally priduced."
"Wish there were more options to have the system build a playlist around automatically. But the overall experience is great, as you would expect."
"Awesome app with clean UI. Loved the audio quality and service!!! Although i am unable to find songs of some artists like Linkin Park... But still i have waited for Spotify, and my wait is over and I am now able to use this mind blowing, awesome and clean music streaming service üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÄüòÄüòÄ"
"I don't have much problems with Spotify but this one thing just bothers me a lot: playing suggested songs at the end of a playlist, whenevever it starts to play the suggested song I can't replay the playlist, I tried clucking the shuffle button but it always brings me back to that song. At least just add a ""replay playlist"" Button or just don't play suggested songs at the end of the playlists at all."
The best music app in terms of UI/UX. The selection of music is also great. I just hope that Hi-Fi music will be available in the future.
Extremely easy to use and opened up a vast world of music and podcast. Especially like exceptionally easy connectivity between phone and TV and car and ability to build a library to listen to off line
I love Spotify but sometimes it likes not load right or it just quits don't know why but it does other wise great. I have now listened to manly Spotify and in my opinion it's still best out there with choices and what they have to offer .
"The absolute best app to stream music. The UI to the audio quality to the user experience to the suggestions, every thing is on point. If spotify releases hi-fi audio, it'll become unbeatable. But even now its the best."
Spotify is quite good and very nice to use. But sometimes it will be very slow and have a poor load time. And I personally don't like how you have to pay just to listen to music.
"Great app, the algorythm creates very good playlists to discover new songs. BUT I can't get rid of a certain genre I stopped listening to years ago. Would be nice if there was an option to prevent certain genres or languages from beein displayed or at least keep them out of the playlists with recommended songs. Also would be nice if there was something like incognito/friends mode where it doesn't effect the recommended music. Always ruins the algorythm if a friend plays music on your phone xD"
"I love Spotify, especially for it's remote control function and it's design, but new version..you know, lyrics is actually the most useful feature you could add, but lyrics design is totally awful... doesnt look like it's made by Spotify at all. guess it will be fixed in few updates, but still.. it could be better if the background was darker, maybe with some kinda pattern that comes from cover of a song, like in a***e music"
"Well,well,well,I gotta say I quite like this music thing but I doesn't have clean versions for every inappropriate songs,I like ""don't be shy""by t√Øesto and KAROL G and there is no clean version of that,if you please could change I will give this app 5 stars"
Just does what you need to listen to great music. The recommendations helps explore new ones or never heard before. UI is unmatched in its intuitiveness.
Like a lot. Now listen to music here rather than what was stored on my phone. A quicker way of accessing full albums is needed though.
"The ads get stacked, however so then does the music. It's frustrating that the 'back' button isn't funcional."
"Love the app but it need to add a ""undo button"" I am tired of accidentally unliking a song and then it's in a different place from when it was at first, it also makes it look like I am just now liking the song or just hearing about it"
"Helpful platform rich content. Will be nicer if the ""previous track"" button is functional when listening to music."
"I love the app so much, but I would give it a 5 star when it works on its queuing. I should be able to queue two albums and shuffle the songs between those albums queued. The only way I can play two albums together and also be able to shuffle between the two would be to create a playlist, and that's very stressful"
"Good to listen to music of your choice that suits your personality, all of the time. Have been using Premium Edition since inception, can't rate highly enough."
"Pleeeaaaaassseeeeeeeee!!! Add a ""retry payment"" button. Just as Netflix did. So we can retry payment when we've got the money. It's tedious to have to re-enter my payment info."
Just recently this app has started to freeze every 3rd or 4th song and I have to touch the play button to restart the song ALSO the car mode is no longer there meaning that while playing music in a vehicle means you have to wake up the phone when you want to skip a song
"Spotify has always been my fav music app. Previously, i would have given it 5 stars but after i switch my phone from iOS to Android, there has been a slight prob. My phone will show Spotify still playing music even after i turned it off. Its really annoying to see that i cant stop it and i had to delete the app. After deleting, for quiet some time nothing else happened. But now it will show spotify trying to play. Not sure if it is my phone's prob or its a bug. But spotify us still cool B)."
I've had Spotify for a few years now and I rely on it for my music - so easy to find what I want to suit my mood and the playlists they put together for me are great. Its well worth building up your own library. I am 75 and appreciate being able to listen to music that spans the years. Also a huge selection of apps so no reason to be bored! I would be lost without Spotify.
"Okay so I genuinely love Spotify, but since it updated last my songs have been glitchy and today half of them wouldn't play or would stop a few seconds into the song. I uninstalled it and tried logging in but it's just saying my internet connection is poor, it's not my wifi at all though. I can't log back in at all. Please update and fix this"
"I used to search up and find music using YouTube and the like. This is by far the best app for music of any kind. With a great algorithm and brilliant UI, I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for:)"
"Waiting for a light mode since I'm squinting to see my screen in the daylight. So many options are tucked away so I couldn't get to them immediately. Like private session; so the app wouldn't think I'm suddenly into another artist/genre when I just wanna check it out one time. And the main screen is always changing, kinda confusing."
Loved it I have been using spotify for three years and it was quite good except the ads but at the wnd of 2nd year i purchased the premium pack and I instantly experienced the change and the privileges. I renewed my pack after a year and the pack price has increased slightly and thats an issue i will be happy if they got down to their old price.
"This is a compatible Music listening to your everyday life, when it comes loved üé∂ you can find on online on YouTube also, the supply of the chosen product music you wanted. You can also download the apps. You should use this to search your favorite music üé∂ and then select the best option to play your guitar üé∏, when you wanted. A bit of sound quality leads to the how are you doing fine, how to cherish also. How do you know what is going well. Play Spotify music üé∂ is having also a good sound."
Spotify works really well and is very has a helpful way of going back on to change the song but yes it does start off buggy by closing the app and having you go back in but afterwards it works smoothly and is gonna have a quick run start
"All your music in one place, you don't need anything else. This app is great only downside is mobile search is not as fully functioning as the desktop, ui can be a little frustrating when switching between tablet and laptop."
"Super easy to use, extremely intuitive to your individual music taste, and constantly being updated with new features and fixes. üíï LOVE IT"
"I live for music and i afore this app. Therefore, I had the indie pop mood filter in my liked songs for one day and I absolutely loved it. After that day, I never saw it again and Im impatiently waiting for this mood to come back. I hope to get a quick feedback and I demand you to put it back."
"LOVE spotify premium, well worth the money. I only have one gripe, regarding the latest update. The latest update took away a good widget, and left only one widget behind- and that widget SUCKS!! The buttons are too small and close together, and don't auto-resize after you enlarge the widget. Please fix the widget, the current one is terrible!"
I use to be a big Pandora fan til a couple years ago. Started using Spotify and haven't touched Pandora again. The app is well designed and fast. Has to s of podcasts too.
"A great app but has limitations. Amazing amount of music available instantly, ability to connect to devices such as PS4 and smart TV is great. However, offline mode is very slow (or doesn't work) and still tries to connect to the Internet when it's enabled and you're playing downloaded songs. Often new updates to the UI feel poorly thought out and like a step backwards in usability."
I like Spotify a lot but why did you replace the wiget:((( I liked when you still had the option to use the old one. The album art is way too small on this new wiget and the play buttons take up way to much room.
this app is genuinely life changing. I get to listen to of my favorite songs for free !! and listen a bunch of new songs and it's so easy to work !! I'd recommend getting it. I already have 329 liked songs in just about a year.
"There are some adds but I really don't mind. Also the app layout is quite nice. The fact that you can hold the device horizontally, means that I can use this app on my tablet as well. So overall I give this app a 5 star rating."
Thankfully podcasts are now available in the Middle East. The UI needs a little bit of improvements with easy seperation between podcasts and songs.
"As a long term patron of spotify, i can say without reservation that my user experience with Spotify has been among my most pleasurable experiences with a single app of any purpose. It delives tunes with a powerhouse catalog of music bridging gaps in history, ethnocuture, genre, and more. Creating and personalizing of endless playlists makes sure your moody status update accompanys its own soundtrack. Ive had almost no complaints and live CS reps have restored my faith in singing out loud. üôä"
Best music app of all time. Find anything and everything with a easy to use UI that make the experience a blast. Love this app
"Great for finding music like the music that I listen to, the download feature has endless uses when I work because it's either a remote location or inside a thick building the data struggles to get to. You find more music that is like the music you like, because that has personal helped more than anything could when it come to finding new music, and the ""enhance"" feature has helped grow my playlists by a ton. Feels like premium is honestly worth it especially duo since I live with my girlfriend."
"From a design perspective, it's not overwhelming and its feature shines on it's own and easy to remember. It easy to listen to my favorite artist with a streamlined interface and be able to save my songs in an organizational manner. Good content and always engaging! 4.5/5"
I switched over from Pandora a while back because I couldn't save anything onto the sd card. The automatic playlist creation isn't quite as good in that regard but every other aspect of Spotify is better. Just have to go in knowing about what you want to hear.
I love how easy you can use the app and sometimes it loads a few more songs so if your offline for a second or two it will continue to play I love how the app is built and I hope who ever works on this app daily like a mod or ceo's hope they have a good day. Edit: so I made my first review a year ago I think nd now I understand that sometimes when I get the 30 minutes of free listening if you watch one add some times I listen to two songs and I've got an add and I timed it one time aswell.
"I love how it quickly connects. But I dislike that it drains my battery so fast even when I close all my apps it remains on my desktop, so I have to keep logging on and off and having to enter my password each time to avoid battery drainage."
Genuinely Spotify not only gives a variety of Music across genres but also I like the Interface and the size in which song's name is written making it Pleasure to hear and a Wonderful Experience in all. The Song Name and ads are like not into your face Plus I really like how they encourage less renowned Singers by putting up their Wonderful songs in different Playlists.
"A more than generous and ever expanding catalogue of songs, albums, compilations featuring ""the best of, very best of,...) As known in the original release format.also playlists are compiled and listed DAILY to suit each listener, containing part ""established likes""and random""songs you might like, for every listener,also anyone can get creative compiling playlists,for their own convenience or to share with whoever likes the ""sound,of their Sounds.cost is several adverts per 30 minutes.Excellent"
The ability to find any song at the press of a button and within seconds. Being able to listen to my greatest artists performing even songs I never knew they performed is mind blowing. Definitely the best app ever. And it's childfriendly too. Spotify is definitely the best. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Best music streaming app in the market. The music quality is good and their music recommendations are just frickin awesome. Their app UI is the best(no competition in that segment) and easy to use. Their music library is up to date. But too many ads in free version makes it quite annoying tbh. The premium version of it is too good and worth the money. Overall best app in the segment.
"Looking for a music app that will complement your music listening audiophile equipment? Spotify is the place to be. Great music app. I heard they are working on Hi-Res, Hi-Fi settings, how exciting!"
"Quite good, not perfect but the redeeming factor over youtube music would have to be that you dont have to pay to play music with your screen off or on other windows. Would recommend."
"After 4 years of being a subscriber, what else can I say: the best music streaming service out there. Only note: I wish the UI would be a bit more intuitive, but the app pretty much alway had this problem and it did greatly improve."
"Overall, I would still rate this app at #2 or #3 as my all time favorite. Primarily due to the UI. I just have never liked it when compared to Rhapsody's (now Napster). Pandora and Spotify are about equal imo. Pandora still has the better long-term retention of playlists, with mine dating before the housing collapse 2008-9."
"Recently my Spotify has been acting up. It's becoming quite slow to my movements and if I've played a different playlist before I play another one the song from my first playlist will stop but it will be the only song that shows. If I try to skip it, it will just skip to the next song from the second playlist I've chosen. Spotify please fix this. (I've updated to its most recent so that's not the issue )"
I don't know if I'm the only one weird like this but I'd love it if there was a sort button in the playlists themselves so you can sort the songs alphabetically or by artists
Amazing amount of music available for download! My music library is quite eclectic. Just hit that shuffle button and I'm listening to all my favorites from every genre of music!
Best experience with any music app so far. Love the daily mix it builds for you. Spotify spoils the music explorer. Family plan is very worth it.
it is a great app but can developer make a new features for liked song. I always accidentally tap the heart button on my other playlist and it ruins my liked song playlist. Cna u make a warning text after the user tap on the heart button? it will make my life much peaceful thanks
The best application for music but the drawback was the ads it was quite annoying while listening on a game so i bought vip thing. It was the best if ads reduces. Anyway i love it.
While the dark mode on mobile the play pause button is not visible. It is very uneasy. Please fix this. Other than that everything is superb
"great music experience, the widget for the home screen could use bigger buttons for easier song selection, as well as play access from the pull down menu. LOVE SPOTIFY"
Love this app! I really enjoy the created Playlist based on what I regularly listen to. Believe me... I listen to quite a few different genres of music!üé∂
"So, ive been using spotify for more than a yar and i have to say its a pretty decent app for music. The ads are announg if youre using free version of it, but once you buy prerium wich gives you 1 month for free (i got 3 months for free because im using a samsung device) it really changes everything. I would give it 5 starts of not those annoyng ads that can really ruin yours ecperience with the app."
"Spotify Premium gives me endless pleasure, allowing me free choice of music and ability to build my library, organise it and then readily choose from my favourites. Customer service is excellent. Very happy."
"The UI, song recommendations, and podcast experience is fantastic. My only gripe is that ""Hey Spotify"" is inconsistent and at times inaccurate."
"It's one of the best music-streaming applications out there. Clean interface, pleasing to the eye, high quality audio and loads of features. And if you ever have a problem, their twitter @SpotifyCares is really quick to reply to your problems. Overall really smooth and flawless experience."
"Been using since 2015. Overall the experience is pretty good. However, would like to see some quirks ironed out, i.e the shuffle sometimes plays same songs over and over in a playlist and I have to manually select other songs to make it play the whole playlist. Bit of an inconvenience on road/during work."
Lyrics. Lyrics. Lyrics. It would be better if there was a button to see the lyrics. I keep skuiling when I wanna check if the song has lyrics and it's quite inconvenient
"Extremely satisfied! Although the fact that I listen to ads on podcasts as a Spotify premium member can get quite annoying. Other than that, 10/10 recommend üòÅ"
Overall very good but randomly there are podcasts showing which I have never listened to.. it stays on the home page forever.... Might require some updates but the music and quality is good. üåºüíú
I love house/techno/classic dance. I had Apple music. Spotify has way more variety than Apple. I prefer Spotify UI also. Spotify doesn't have all the music that is present on YouTube.
I don't know what I would have done without spotify. My day starts with spotify and ends with spotify. I created my own playlist so I could listen to my own preferred kind of music. Spotify is a blessing in disguise as it entertains me with over a million songs and will always be in my life for as long as I live..........
"The greatest music streaming app; I've used apple music, Pandora, etc but this one has the best user friendly UI, great audio quality, multi-streaming options. Take my money please"
"I prefer to listen to spotify instead of the radio. I'm able to choose music that I prefer to listen to, only the ads are a bit of a nuisance, when I can't afford premium at the moment."
"Large searchable catalog. You can create sharable playlist and simply add songs to your custom stations that you can also share. Very reliable and affordable and I have been finding more edited song versions. Great UI, Platform, App."
"Maybe I just need to get used to using this app because compared to others that I have used, it's not very user friendly. Hopefully I will get it figured out because I don't want to continue to pay for something that I have difficulty navigating. **The song and artist selection is quite awesome tho! üéµüé∂üé∏üé§üéßüéöÔ∏èüìª"
"Worked great on Android until a recent update (Spotify or Android) in the last 4 months. If opened on Wifi, crashes UI, freezes phone and requires a hard reboot to make phone useable again."
"Spotify is an exceptional app. I truly admire the UX and UI, as it's very simple and straightforward. I personally find Spotify to be the best music streaming app ever!"
"Are there other ways to get your groove on, I am loyal to a fault, Spotify has not passed me off yet. I say 5 stars out of 5 stars. Try it, you'll like it, trust me, the only thing I take seriously, is fun. Give me life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. When I am pursuing happiness, I don't like to be impeded. When I want my music, I don't want to be hassled, w/ Spotify. I press play and my chilaxation begins."
Could have a better interface for last listened songs. Grouping and searching could more intuitive. Could offer international radio. However is still the best music app. Reviewed 19 October 2021 Obviously they listen to their subscribers üòã You can now see your 'last listened music.' I love the suggestions and it can make your discover more artists and music you would love. My next suggestion is to make the interface even more intuitive by offering to save songs and artist in specific playlist.
It's a well laid out UI and the ability to stream to Alexa speakers/groups is a welcomed feature. Recently I had an issue with Android Auto where Spotify wouldn't work at all. Over a period of time Spotify support were helpful throughout and went through the diagnosis with me and we're both patient and pleasant. (Issue got resolved when my OS version updated). The playlist features - like sharing sessions - are really good and I can discover music really easily. I love the artist info too!
"love it when free, but premium you get what you pay for. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 2021 edit: please reconsider changing the like button. Perhaps relocate the like button next to the name/title of the song for easier functionality for example. I have unliked so many songs just because I've tried pausing lol. But in my defense, the Like button is right next the the pause/play buttonas well. Help?üòÖ"
"Although it functions well and nice as we've subscribed to it, the design could get some improvements‚Äî especially the lyrics and the background."
OMG I love Spotify. My son downloaded it for me and if it ain't the greatest thing for music I don't know what is! I was using mp3 juices to download my favourites. And used up soooo much of my storage doing so. But NOW IM SO HAPPY! It got to the point I didn't even bother with music TIL HE GAVE ME THIS BEAUTIFUL GIFT! YEEEE BOI! could not Be happier! and I haven't had a single issue out of it.
"I LOVE this app. A couple things: please make a way for anyone to add music for themselves on spotify. im a kid and need to upload clean songs as i cant trust other ppl cuz they just say clan and dont actully make it clean. Also, it would be cool to play music in the car without needing premuim"
"Used to be great but since some weeks started pausing songs several times, even the downloaded ones. Already updated and still happens quite often. Online and offline."
"I am satisfied & the price for the software is very accommodating! I appreciate that Spotify searches & offers songs of my persoanl preferance. The music, may then be selected, when required or desiring to listen at leisure. Thanks, Spotify! Joanne"
"Always had a good time with the spotify app. I have one request if possible, could you add a quick and easy way to swap to car mode? I don't have Bluetooth in my car so it doesn't automatically swap when I plug the aux in. Could there be a button to swap to car mode in the quick access menu in the top right when you're listening to a song? Thanks!"
The playlists you can make are on point. Quite a few ads on the free version but they gotta make money somehow. But also don't lie and say this is the only ad for 30 minutes and then break your promise and hit me with 3 back to back. Better than Pandora üòÑ
I loved Spotify until the latest update. Now I can't use the shuffle button or play a different song. All it does is play a preview. But I'm willing to continue using it because it is a great app
"My only complaint is that they will loop your liked songs over and over even if you make a new playlist off of a song. Would like maybe a ""reset liked songs"" button or something to expand my horizons."
There are a lot of ads wich make it hard to enjoy my favorite song. But there are lyrics and almost all the songs are available so it is quite nice.
"Really good music app ! üíØ I'm just wondering why the hell the ""Hide this song"" button sometime pushes the ""Add to playlist"" down. It's confusing that buttons don't stay at the same place. Fortunately we can undo an unwanted hiding. Without this option my ""Like"" playlist would be empty by now ! ü§£"
"Ok Spotify fixed my issues, but here's some quick advice for those that don't pay. Hide songs and artist in playlists, it's pretty easy and saves you skips."
"I love the overall UI and recommendations of the app. But there needs tp be two separate tabs for my own created playlists and the playlists I have liked. Otherwise, it becomes difficult to find my own playlists amidst the sea of playlists I have liked. Also, we should be able to make our own play queues without having to make a playlist and we should be able to rearrange the whole queue not just the ones coming after the song which is being played. I hope you do something about these issues."
Used Tidal and YouTube Music. Spotify still has the best UI and it has certain songs that even YouTube Music doesn't have. 1 bad note is that the equaliser in the settings tab is missing after updating.
"I think it's a great app for streaming. Spotify suggested songs that suits my preference and vibe. The premium is great and yeah no ads. For broke person like me, premium for one day is a best option with low cost."
"This is really cool. You can either have a paid subscription or just use it for free. The prices of Premium subscription is quite affordable. Even if you don't have a premium subscription, there aren't much ads. So if you're looking for an app to listen to music without spending money, go with this!"
"Use frequently, very smooth, brilliant UI, brilliant personalisation/customisation. Sometimes a couple of minor blips. Shuffle will sometimes randomly put the same song queued three times in a row (out of a playlist with 2000+ songs) either I should get a lottery ticket or there's a functional bug there, not a big deal though. Sometimes pressing the three dots ""menu option"" next to a song is unresponsive."
"All is well with the app, but I'm actually quite disappointed with the latest update as due to that only I guess I'm unable to find the equaliser setting, or I think it actually has disappeared :(( please do look into it. üôÅ It was my favourite feature in Spotifyüò¢"
"Love it man, podcasts is what I mainly listen to with Spotify and they have a pretty good selection. Lots of options you can toggle if you're into fiddling and UI is pretty good"
I love everything about the way it's set up and the simplicity of the app. The only thing I don't like is the algorithm that picks similar music to yours. Quite often it's way out of the wheelhouse. Other then that its beautiful!
"Convenient, sound quality is great, love downloading music/pods to listen to off grid. Update: While I still use the app daily the new update to the library is absolutely awful! Makes navigating your downloaded episodes/albums much more difficult! Thanks! Update 2: Please fix the UI!!! Finding podcast downloads is a complicated mess, it used to be so easy and somehow you've screwed it all up! This is still a great service overall but navigation has become needlessly annoying!"
Best music application available. Suggested playlist and songs are very accurate. Latest music and genres available. Easy to use. Great user experience overall.
"I really love this app! I was searching for apps where i can stream/download music and when I found Spotify, it quickly became my number 1 app for music and podcasts, but mostly music."
"I like the overal design of the app, the only thing I would to add is a function which puts albums/songs to a list that you want to listen to later. So maybe make a function called ""listen later"""
"Great app with smooth UI. But, way too many adds that destroy the listening experience. Got premium to get rid of those annoying adds."
The app works well most of the time. There are some bugs that make the app freeze occasionally and or crash. Overall Spotify has a great library of music and a slick UI that makes it enjoyable to use. Spotify Premium is well worth it's cost for the no ads experience.
"Would be better if there was a button to skip forward and backward a certain block of time--say, 15 seconds--when listening to music. Audible has this sort of rewind feature. With Spotify, I have to unlock my phone and take my chances rewinding or skipping ahead with the progress slider. Makes using the app a pain."
"Love that I get to listen to music when &what I want too,the only thing that I'd fix wld be when serching for a song when it pops up&you push play to listen to it another song will play instead??also cld do w/o the advertising ruining my music enjoyment!otherwise Spotify is üëç!"
"Ive been using spotify for the better part of 5 years, and i recommend it any time anyone asks. The spotify experience on mobile and on desktop has been seamless. Getting premium was well worth it and nearly paid for itself quickly in convenience alone. 5 stars"
"Quick, entertaining, easy to use, access to nearly every artist ever born, From early beginning's Beethoven, Bach, or jump into the latest rock. You can journey in some of the worlds most Beautiful country and throughout. With a chance to get fresh talk and hear all of what this world's rappin about."
"I do love Spotify but PLEASE make some kind of incognito mode. I listen to metal in my daily life but at night time I like to listen to ASMR or rain sounds due to my tinnitus but now all of my recommendations/release radar/suggestions are just rain sounds and all the metal music is gone. I'm skipping 95% of the recommendations because of this. If I could turn incognito mode on at night time so it wouldn't ruin my regular playlists it would be awesome. Please, please, please consider this!"
"Sometimes the app will randomly play songs that are not on my playlists, from singers that I have never listen to. It's quite creepy when it's 3 AM and suddenly my phone plays instrumental songs. Tried some solutions like unlink my facebook and log out of the app, but those didn't seem to solve the problem"
"I love Spotify, I love the playlists it makes for me and the way it reccomends songs. I do miss the old UI style, the new layout is a little annoying in the fact that I can't listen to all the songs I've ""liked"" from a single artist without making a playing as you no longer have a ""library"" you just go to the artists page, but it's still a great streaming service."
"Dear developer, Your machine learning algorithms are excellent and always on point when it comes to suggesting something,the only issue with the application is that it requires a strong connection to the server and therefore the song stops at times while playing &also there are quite a few times when a lot of advertisement irritate the listener also there is no option to skip advertisements , please look forward to making a button for it otherwise the application cannot get any better. Thank you"
"Excellent variety of music I like, recommended tunes new to me, and playlists I'd loop. Bad advertising, makes me never want to get whats advertised, sound during ads needs to be a lot quieter, add a random song generator based on my preferences, and add smart options for riding bicycle, like the car options please!"
Overall loving the experience. My dad got here before I did and I'm embarrassed that I wasn't quick enough to change (I was attached to my ipod and iTunes). There are a few artist that they don't have so I'm hoping that they can add more non-main stream artists.
"Have had Premium for years and love it to bits when it works. BUT like many of the reviews lately constantly glitching is becoming a drag as it requires me to uninstall and reinstall the app. Glitches include: not streaming certain songs even when wifi or 4g is fine, not playing selected songs or albums at all, blank screen and general unreliability. Should probably be 3 stars but like I said, it's great when it works üôÇ"
"Very good! but some annoying problems Its a great app but the problems are 1st you only can skip 6 songs in 1hr and if you want to repeat songs it pauses then starts again , if you want to make a playlist it says the artists thats in it but the songs dont show up until you press that artists button, it would be great ot if you'd fix that lots of people are having problems with that, thank you. üëëüíéüíø"
Music Quality Is really Good.. Buffering is comparatively Less From Jiosaavn and airtel music app. User Interface is quite good. The best Thing is its User Curated Playlists. But sometimes Ad repeats itself even before the 30 min Time gets over.
"Probably the best music app I used till date. I like the UI very much, playlist creation, songs suggestion to our moods and also the quality of the songs. It has millions songs even from young unknown artists and those songs are also good and the recent addition like Disney stories and other stories also good. Podcast is great and fun to listen while working out doing something. So much to explore."
I love it. It has so many playlists just suiting my moods and likes. It's really a great app for music when you want to chill drive or even cry your heart out. Even allows you to sing along with the lyrics ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ive enjoyed finding music that have travelled with me in life. The pld and still more new in the near future. I grew up listening to al genras and explore some never heard of. Yet ive not put into use all the experience Spotify has to offer. Im going through hard times but the music gives me tranquility. You are hete for me thank you. Thank you a lot. Keep up the good work dont let me down. Sincerely Susan Horton
Its fluid...it works...lots of whatever for whoever. Lots of album art and stuff ...Offline mode works well...just remember to update it ...worth the premium subscription highkey... 12 out 10 I guess...I've used Spotify a lot over...uh...3 or so years maybe more or less...its aight enuff to write a review about and not talk spicy in a negative way... I wonder if they'll give me a free month for this?
Before buying premium i didn't used Spotify that mush and used like 3 different apps to listen to music but after I've bought the premium i only use Spotify and i can happily say that I'm not disappointed and it meets all my requirements and is highly compatible and feature rich!
"What can I say, an app that deals in music streaming is a win no matter what. Now one as spot on as spotify is (pun intended) the GOAT! Thank you for being there with the perfect song all the time and the free range to build playlists with such ease."
"Spotify is the best application out there for music lovers. I would, however, ask that Spotify quickly expand its Group Sessions feature to free accounts as well. Other than that, the user interface is very pleasing and easy to navigate, and the quality and quantity of the music available is truly incredible."
Spotify makes listening to music a stellar experience for me. Hands down it's the best! A commercial or two every hour actually suits my pace because hey ya gotta pee sometime right? Spotify rocks!
"Great app for anyone listening to music, casually or whatnot. Spotify is however not the best method for artists to earn money, especially smaller ones. The spread of pay/play is too wide between big and small artists. Would be good if there was a donate button for each artist."
I really love Spotify. Because it has tons of playlists which is very beautiful for different moods. I feel very happy to listen to songs and UI is very friendly. It would be much better if they had a lyrics options for music. But very beautiful app for music lovers. Keep going Spotify. And it would be really great if Spotify had hifi or lossless master audio quality option like apple music or tidal. So I request Spotify to get that option as soon as possible. Thank u
I love this app not only because of the large music library they have but also its app availability across different media devices and unobtrusive to other apps that require immediate attention. ‚≠ê‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
"It has been a very intuitive journey, through my mental health. Music gave me the ability to look at the video, but come up with my own version. Good or bad, it was mine. That's powerful to say with the life I've lived, in these 45 years. üòòü•∞ü§óüòãüòóüòÅüòöü§£üòéüê∂üòÄü¶Ñü¶Ñü§©ü§óüòè"
"Spotify is just great, it's always getting better and changing the UI and interesting ways. I like how at the end of the year they show me really cool stats about how I listen to music. The only thing I wish Spotify had was the actual lyrics to certain songs like how Apple music does"
"Great experience, best interface and new music discovering experience. Private session button should be easier to access."
Recommendation are top notch.. this ui feels smooth and easy to access. Huge collections of songs library and daily some special songs it offers. It's really worth my subscription.
Spotify is a music lover's dream in terms of its ease-of-use and intuitive interface. The incredibly full and deep database of song titles is also fantastic. Try it! You'll be glad you did.
If you don't mind a few adverts you can listen to tunes you can pay and get more benefits easy to use and I just keep it on shuffle as long as my phone gets a signal I can listen to quite alot of songs. 02 data runs out super fast so I've Changed networks. Make a couple of playlists ‚ú®.
"No competition for Spotify out there. Absolutely clear winner amongst musics streaming apps. Their UI, sound quality, recommendations, playlists, collection is top class. No space for cringe music untill you really search for it. Promotes quality music. Literally each and every single artists' profile is fantastically maintained.Don't need to say about podcasts. Do we ever look any where else for podcasts?"
"If you can't afford to build up your own digital library this is your best option, just tell the app the artists and genres you like and it'll make up playlists for you, occasionally it'll surprise you with something new or something you'd forgotten about."
My favourite and only muisc app i have used for years. Reliable. I love I can look at not just songs but whole albums and see the covers. Sometimes people don't remember all that or it's not an artist you are familiar with - or heard any other music from them - but you can find and listen. It can be a one off song you are listening to and favourite it or add it to playlists. It has everything I need and i don't need any other music apps. Connects with shazam to.
Spotify genuinely good it always enjoy over mood by it play list and by know our test and really improve our music sense and make us love and attachement towards this app I really like this app who provide a million of songs for us not other app compare Spotify due to it quality and I love and very enjoy all songs on Spotify tnx....and suggest please try once if you never try
"Just the best, premium is quite expensive after a while but it is 100% worth it. I couldn't imagine switching to any other music provider, Spotify is just perfect for everything; gaming, running, working out, chilling, there are the best quality songs to be streamed on your command."
"Some artists songs (1nonly/skeler), stop playing, or it's like someone pressed the mute button while I'm checking my email. Other artists like Kanye West play without issues. Don't know what's going on but it needs to be resolved."
"For some reason the ""playlist"" button isn't working/responding for me (the one in the bottom right when viewing a song next to the ""share"" button). Pressing it doesn't take me to the current playlist or queue - it only show a little animation of being pressed and nothing else happens. Other than that, a great app and service!"
"Spotify has the best intuitive interface, a fantastic recommendation engine powering its customized playlists, new features added all the time, social tools that make sharing easy, plus you can use it almost anywhere through almost any device. I really like what you have done with the design recently giving it more of a Fluid Look so Keep it Up ‚úåüèª."
"Please add a ""Pause downloads"" button and the ""Download with cellular"" setting should also apply on metered Wi-Fi connections. Been using this service for more than 4 years and it's good."
"17/09: Giving another star as they've harmonised their UI over Android & iOS - finally you can slide down to search any playlist! whoop whoop! Spotify just launched their newest feature: Blend. Allowing you to have a tailored, paired playlist with a friend. I am a bit of a Spotify fan boy (Their Discover Weekly won me over initially, great recommendations!) but when there is a tech issue it can leave the app unusable - so keep hold of your Soundcloud and YouTube playlists just in case."
"Edit: while there are still some songs available, situation has improved quite a lot, so updated the stars. App and service deserves 5 stars, but lack of songs in India is why I slashed the three stars. When it comes to streaming, huge catalogs are mandatory and essential. Hope the deal with Warner works out in India, but until then other platforms have more songs."
"It was so good until today. I don't know what happened but I think my subscription ran out and now I can pause, skip or anything. I can only play songs but after like 5 minutes of not opening the app it stops and the music is really quiet. It doesn't even pause when I open a video. Please fix this, I really wanna enjoy music a bit more"
It was amazing being able to listen to music and look through my Instagram at the same time but I hate not being able to pick a specific song to listen to without having to pay for premium but overall it's quite a cool app
"So, it has everything one might ask for. But there is an issue. That is, the app doesn't like have any idea what you are playing in premium, so sometimes in songs that make you cry like crazy amounts of tears, it will say: ""Wow what a song. Makes ME feel like dancing."" It's quite embarrassing you know. So please take care of this in the next update."
"I would need two extra features for this app to rate it 5 stars: -a timer to turn Spotify ON at a specific time (not just off like the sleep timer does) -to be able to see the current song & play/pause/forward and back buttons on my phone's lock screen. My old phone running Android 7 used to have this, but for some reason it stopped after a while"
It has practically every song or artist I can think of. It's the only music or podcast resource I use. It's intuitive and easy to navigate.
One of the best music/song app platform. The songs are so clear and pure i just love this app. The quality of the songs is premium on Spotify even the UI is easy to use everything is great about this app‚ô•Ô∏èThe only disadvantage is you get 3-4 or 5 ads contionously which tells you to take their subscription. But it's totally understandable as we're using a free version even Spotify should earn something. Anyway. Good job developers:)
"the service is great but the UI of the app isnt. It lacks some really useful features: like, for example, the ability to select multiple songs at the same time to add or remove them from a playlist or the ability to swipe to delete them. really easy stuff the absence of which is really annoying. bugs are not unusual"
I'm surprised I like it better than Pandora. But the UI is not as good. It's very busy and takes time to learn. I prefer clean and simple. Still it selects good music.
All over a good app in my opinion the best music app that is out there you can listen to any song and there is in built lyrics but there is one thing I used Spotify premium it doesn't work in airplane mode but it's the best
"This is GREAAATTTTT. Other than just listening to music it has a whole load of other cool features. Such as, the music just gets softer when another app is playing audio, unlike others who usually pause, It has a lot of shortcuts when you're listening via earphones, for example, a single click on the button pauses/plays the audio like normal but double tapping the button skips to the next song and triple tapping goes back to the previous one. Absolutely love it!!!"
"Spotify is a very nice app, and I use it everytime to listen to music. But it has a tendency of lagging sometimes, and sometimes the screen even fully freezes and I can't do anything. So I'm removing one star for that. Other than that, I think Spotify is great to use with many diverse music/podcast options and an easy and convenient design."
"quality of music is really special especially classical music As of today not sure what the problem is but spotify wont work on my mobile phone. Tried uninstalling , cleared cache, reinstalled but when trying to push the play button on any song nothing happens. Any ideas on the problem?"
"Spotify is just ""effin"" DOPE!! Super user-friendly, almost any and every single song...of every single genre, and the overall design and look of Spotify is extremely attractive! Job well done Spotify üíØüí™üèΩüî•üî•"
"In my personal opinion? The best streaming music app there is! So easy to build your own personalized lists, and the recommendations that Spotify makes helps you build the perfect library! Plus being able to find other user's lists makes the possibilities endless! A MUST HAVE App!"
"For the people complaining about ads and not to being able freely play music... quit being cheap. the app is the best music streaming app and its available on almost every platform. My only critique is... i guess right before an update is released the functionality doesn't work right on Android OS 10. The music plays but, it doesnt display the right song info playing and it frequently stops playing the song until you hit play again. Hey Devs! When we gonna get that linux support?? Lol"
The latest update has ruined everything. Even if I want to play from my playlist I can't and the songs all are shuffled by itself I can't playback the song I like because it has only got forward option and not a backward option and only I can skip 6 songs per hour. I mean what the hell is that? At first I gave 5 star rating because the app is much better than any other apps but now due to this update I'm reducing one star. I hope you guys will bring back the old version.
"Giving it 5 because my year long problem has already been fixed. I hope this goes on. Im subscribing to premium again. (Please add a Play Next button! Also please allow us to add a whole album or playlist to be ""Play Next"" or add to queue)"
"Almost all music you can think of thats been commercialized is found here. Great app and great UI experience. Affordable too, try the share package if you have a family. Keep it up spotify!"
"Quite good, toooo many adds but overall it's an amazing app:) also a lyrics translator would be a great extention....but it lacks many of the features on my old devices and by many I mean MANY so....yeah... Overall it's amazing"
"Since the last update, if I double press the skip button on my headphones while listening to a podcast, it skips the whole podcast instead of just fast forwarding 15 seconds like it's supposed to and has always done."
"This app is amazing and the audio quality even in the free version is very good. Beautiful UI and good performance as well. I don't give it five stars cause I sometimes miss the lyrics of songs inside the proper app rather than having to Google them. Also, I've checked the prices of premium versions in other music apps as well and they are the same as Spotify, so I would recommend to low the price al least a bit so that people rather pay for Spotify and not for other apps."
I've had spotify for years now and I'm happy with the service! I have a quick suggestion. I have a google chrome cast. On my other computers I was able to download my playlist onto my laptop but unfortunately I was unable to download on this computer. Why is that? I was honestly curious because every other device that I own can download the playlists/songs/podcast but doesn't on my computer :( I would like an update so compatibility is possible... Other than that I love the service and will continue using. Just a small complaint...
Over all a good app but something annoys me so much that I want to quit Spotify that whenever I search up a song or something it just Lags out I have find songs by writing the artists name and then scroll down so much pls fix this since I have premium and this is annoying
"I do like this app alot and use it quite often, the premium isn't all too expensive, but I'd still prefer to not spend that much money, I don't like how you can't listen to one single song unless you're on an apple tablet. Nor am I fan favorite of not being able to download songs, but it does make sense nonetheless. Overall I would say it's a good app, and recommend it to anyone looking for a source to listen to music other than YouTube."
It's really good with premium. Although the UI leaves quite a lot to be desired. Without premium it is seriously lackluster.
"It's so much more intuitive when searching I prefer to put songs in specific order on most Playlists However, not thrilled about not having older versions of songs and/or songs becoming n/a, but overall a great music app it's better than the other's that choose Playlists for you"
If you're having a problem with your service you can email them at the developer link below and prob get a quick response. It's a Saturday and I did not expect them to get back to me today. The app wasn't working for me at all the last week. I was communicating with them most of the day and it was a hassle but in the end we came to a solution and it works now. They provided me with a free month when I requested it and everyone was really friendly. New UI is not my preference. 2 stars usability.
It's a great app and the features are good except for one feature that was just added called the blends I try to start one and I click on the button and nothing happens so my girlfriend tried to start one with me I clicked the link and it just redirected me to the homescreen of the app other than that it's a really good app
I like the app but what I don't like is that the app add things on to my playlist and I like to listen to my music not what you put in for me to do so when I push to random order button it shows a song that y'all put on their stop doing that.
First time I've ever gone out of my way to give something a rating.... they added a way to listen to specific genres from your Playlist. My brain is about as organized as my liked.... so it reflects and taking the time to build a Playlist from 500+ songs is not something I have the attention span to do fantastic
"THE best music streaming service, easy to use, easy to understand. Building your own playlists, Download iconic albums and listen anytime anwhere. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
I still think there are some fixes that coulc be done to the UI but i love the amount of music that i can discover on there from around the world. I will always enjoy that.
"I love this app as millions around the world do too!!! Super easy to use, updates you on the latest songs released by your favorite artists and recommends awesome custom-made playlists that suit your taste! 100% would recommend to everyone, miles better than every other music app and premium is definitely worth the money!"
"It may get a DJ option but you can make whatever playlist you like, within the vast choices of music. You can search by genre, mood, titles, artists and there are lots of built in playlists."
I'd give it 5 stars. It takes time to figure out how to do all the things it features and provides. I heard you will have to re download all the songs you have again. Kinda the con in my thoughts. But other then having to build the Spotify to your own preference for music.
"Good... But... It would be nice if you added a ""not interested"" button on the ""things you might like"" row. I kinda get sick of seeing the same things that I'm not going to play over and over again. And for things I started to play, something that I wound up not liking, to have a way of removing them from my stuff.."
"Update: Good and decent app, a much better selection of music now, as compared to that of before. Suggestion: Please try to introduce FLAC and other HD formats. I used premium subscription for quite some time, but now I am exploring alternative platforms that might offer FLAC or even better sound quality. Of course I'm not complaining, but, just as a suggestion. I'm most likely to return to premium soon though."
this is a good app overall it's easy to make a playlist but i dont like that if you don't have premium access then sometimes the ads interrupts half of the song i was listening to & then it ruins it and skips to the next song
One of the best streaming apps with an extremely wide selection of music. Only gripe is that the pricing for premium is quite high.
"I just love the fact that I can listen to any song on this app. I enjoy classic rock and this is the best place to find it. In a quiet moment or roadtrip, my Spotify playlist is my noisy, moody or brooding company"
"It's a great app, I've had the premium for some years now, but recently some bugs started happening, like I used to be able to change music pressing the side buttons of my phone, for some reason I can't anymore. I also used to be able to change music and pause or play on locked screen, I also can't anymore so what's happening?"
"Listening to the Nine Design for many weeks, have learned so much, about myself, my family and friends.Started many years ago, but am still able to see new ways to change, especially being a 7!"
"After so many years last time I checked it, it's changed for the best. Having a lot of fun these past few days retaking my long loved collections, it's now a robust and intuitive platform. Thank you!"
"Really good app overall, and the redesign does look great. Only issue I have is that the app keeps showing a downloading notification every time I open the app. Even when there's nothing to download it just starts downloading for whatever reason."
"There could be better recommendations and rewind songs refreshes! After continuous listening for about 2 hours of playback per day you get bored of your own songs! That's where the old hits repeat is needed to be just perfect! Still for some reason I find the car's radio more appealing because I hear unexpected great songs. Please redesign the algorithms and the old songs playlist to match more interests. Don't stick to what most people listen, but create uncommon playlists from past."
"Well, the overall design of Spotify is impressive. Spotify is my new Music Vault. I do like Pandora, however I've noticed when playing my toddler music (age appropriate), adult rated music will sneak in - yes I said, ""sneak in"" as in sneaky - almost purposely introducing toddler innocent minds to *adult rated music* inappropriate and unappreciated. No Good* - please ""Spotify"" filter your playlist/channels delicately, bc mom's like me, I'm not having it! - ü§ó"
App interface is great. It provided me a best user experience than other music players but for better visual experience of title gif the lyrics tab can be hidden in gif focus view.
I will always be a Spotify user. I love your UI theme and you maintain independence from acquisitions. I will always keep my membership unless it gets ridiculously expensive. As far as the apps go I wish the Online/Offline toggle was more in the open. I don't like having to dig to get to it.
"It's kinda weird even having to rate Spotify after 23 million odd reviews. Been using it for almost a decade and gotta warn once you try it's going to be hard to quit. From a free user to premium, love their suggestions based on the user listening patterns not to mention their wide library of songs from all over the world. Offline listening, podcasts just seems get better year after year."
"While I like Spotify for its UX, I think the sound quality is better on my prime music account. I have tried listening to the same song on both, using Bose speakers, and opinion is unchanged."
Good source for a variety of music. I love the different stations. I can name one of my artist and follow it with the word radio and I get quite a selection of music it's very similar.
"I've been using Spotify for quite some time now, and it's the only music platform I use. Theres not much to mention other than, it's my go-to, and it's so easy to use."
"I absolutely LOVE Spotify. I have ADHD and Bipolar so music is really important to me because it helps me concentrate and helps me manage invasive unhealthy thoughts on my tough days, I can barelyget by without it. I started using Spotify back in the begining of 2015 before it required a paid subscription for no adds and unlimited use and downloads, and I am 100% happy to pay for it, worth every single penny and really is so cheap considering what it has to offer. Also, the app is flawless üëå"
All songs are available here. I love SPOTIFY but one problem is there that when we press left rewinding button it don't change the song in the middle of any song. Rest of it is OK. Please fix it.
I would have given this app 5 stars but I only listen to older music.There is quite a few songs I can't get and a lot of them are remastered but apart from that I like the app . I opted to upgrade and pay for the app
I love this app for music the only thing that sucks is some music from big artist isnt on there an then when u pay ur bill in the middle of the month it wants your payment again the beginning of the following month instead of waiting the 30 days its suppose to charge u i do love it tho thats why i gave it 5 stars theres just a couple tweeks they need to fix but ive been usuing it for years if y'all want a good music app this is it
The best one always. When I installed and started listening it's the best app compared to other ones. Initially without premium the ads were pretty frequent and quite disturbing. When I subscribed to the premium it was so great that everyday we would get our daily mixes and filtered podcasts daywise according to our followed lists. I would gladly recommend this app for music being a music lover‚ù§Ô∏è! go for it & enjoy the musicüéµ
"Much more enticing and Beautiful graphics are possible...as long as you're at it...maybe take some hints from Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and Fantasia....you don't have to lose clear business communications in making the visuals irresistibly immersive like great music! MAKE IT A DESTINATION!!!"
"I've keep on continuing subscriptions for this app (Premium Duo) as I have no problem using it. Besides the good and trendy music listening, I still can enjoy the music in background while getting busy with other apps. I highly recommended to use high-tech in ear wireless headphone to experience digital sound clarity and high bass music. It's addictive. Thank you."
"Great app and the music selection is cool, but I don't like the fact that in a gospel mix, other genre of music gets to show up frequently. It ruins the whole essence of the mix. But aside this, I'm enjoying every bit of the app"
"Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world. Basic functions such as playing music are totally free, but you can also choose to upgrade to Spotify Premium. ... Build collections of music and podcasts. And more! You can try it and i am 100% sure you will love itüñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üíöüíöüíöüíö"
"[Original Rating: ****]Installed recently, liking the experience so far. Great library management features, well laid out UI and excellent recommendations. Will update review after using for 6 months or so. Edit 1: Why am I seeing Hindi songs in my home screen suggestions, when I have not selected Hindi in my languages? I don't even have the option to remove it. *** now."
I normally just go to my liked songs and hit shuffle. internet was beinf slow and my phone was saying its full. after a bit i find the notification sayinh im downloading something and it turns out there is this little download songs button that requires no verification. my phone was trying to download all 1200 songs on my list. please fix. i know its impossible to get ahold of the company unless i get some petition signed but its worth a shot
Spotify is the only music source I use to listen to a wide variety of songs and podcasts. The monthly fee for my family plan is extremely 5reasonable. I've discovered so many new artist using Spotify's weekly playlists that I quit counting a long time ago.
"I use premium and the experience is superb. Can listen to it with or without wifi(for downloaded songs). They even specially create playlists for me every week :), helps me explore songs! (only thing is that when using through safari, it will stop after one song and you will have manually press for it to continue, quite irritating but the in app experience is amazing)"
"Spotify is good if you have premium, which is quite expensive, however the benefits may be worth it for you since the ability to have a large selection of music on your phone ad free and downloadable is very nice. That privelidge just comes at a relatively high price."
"Absolutely fantastic. Yes there are ads, but thats every free game that requires wifi. Don't like ads? Buy premium! I would recommend this to anybody who doesn't have it. If I could rate 6 stars, I would."
"My favorite music app I use. All the effects are simple and easy to use, and I love the quilty options for the downloads. Keep it up Spotifyü§ô"
"Love the app, but the most recent update that removed the rewind button in the lock screen player is extremely frustrating, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way. The like button is useless in this mini player, we benefited much more from the rewind button. Please bring it back..."
"1million songs in your pocket. I have used premium service for almost 3years. Really enjoy it. The quality of the sound can be set in settings and if you have a good set of earphones, it's worth the listen. Interface could be more intuitive and equaliser settings not so difficult to set."
"This is an easy and intuitive App to use. I love that it can stream in very High Quality, as I have no data restrictions. The difference is clear. I don't even look at Pandora anymore. Spotify has earned it's top position in my opinion. üëçüèªüòéüëçüèª"
"Changed back to 5 stars. The UI as it is now is useful, informative and not buggy. A lot more enjoyable experience!"
I was forced to switch to Spotify due to my favorite parcast podcasts only playing on here now. I can't figure out how to not the episode automatically go to the next. Turning off the autoplay button didn't work. The only reason I'm giving Spotify 5 stars and not 4 is because I find it soooo awesome that the podcasts episodes come with transcripts. That's something that my old podcast app didn't do. I had to download another app to accommodate this shortcoming but w/Spotify I don't need it üòä
"I've been using Spotify for years and really enjoy it. I only wish they would bring back the dislike button, so you wouldn't have to keep skipping songs you don't like."
"Love it but it does have an annoying tendency to ""undownload"" album and playlists I have downloaded as well as quite often tell me there is no internet connection when there is...and when it does this I can't access any music downloaded or otherwise. Apart from that I love it..."
"It's a great music streaming app, the ads are quite irritatating, but they aren't as frequent as I thought they'd be. But over all very happy with the app."
It's a really good app for music lovers like me.But as a tablet user which has just 16GB space it's quite difficult to have Spotify as it takes too much space.It already has taken over more than 1.5 GB of my space.So I request you to reduce the space taken over by Spotify when you're at leisure.I would give five stars if my Spotify space would be lower than 700MB.(I also know of Spotify lite but it's not possible for me to make it into landscape.So please make it possible to rotate my screen)
"Just using a months free trial and works great but i'll only be taking up a subcription if they bring out c.d. lossless as the quality isn't quite there for me, untill they do (if?) I'll stick with qobuz."
"Please, add option to get back ""Previous track"" button to minimized version of player in notifications. Last update changed it to like button, which i don't use"
"It is very good but there is a glich in app when we connect to wireless headphones , and once we listen a song and then if get out completely of the app and then if we use headphone buttons then the song runs without opening app and it is a glich i hope you understood it and definitely try it once"
"Wonderful selection of music to suite all ages. On or Off line, you can listen to any track you want or a selection of tracks or pod casts"
"Good app, however be weary. Whilst listening to music if you did not get premium then ads and ""suddgested"" music tracks, these are annoying because whilst listening to music you may have to waste your skips just to get past music you don't want to hear and the fact it requires Internet for no readkn. But apart from these criticisms it's a good app."
Functions perfect with download time on data or wifi everything is easy to access. With a perfected app though that could be developed further with payment options for official music videos in a 00.25$ option beside each song that could/would/possibly be added to the phone bill which i find is honestly the best method of payment in any purchase related interaction as its safe and no information is required the bill just increases and a safe more compact method of payment is felt ? o.O
"I genuinely loved this app being able to have so many songs that I love downloaded being able to listen to all the time. But the last few months have been real bizarre. I would be going through listening to songs and then It will like freeze on one song and then when ya click out of it, it's not even titled the same... and it would freeze my whole phone like this has happened like 10+ times today it's getting annoying and idk why it's like this"
This is one of the best things to have especially if you want to game or are busy with work or other things. This is a good app but I really want a organization button for your playlist that way you know what song is coming.
"Being a developer myself, I admire the UI design of this application. It's minimalistic design with right colour combinations and strong algorithms used to recommend similar songs are remarkable. These are enough points to make me use this stunning app."
"Good App, Many songs are available.. But there are too many adds that is very disturbing... And to remove those adds we have to take premium.. which requires money.. And 8 and many more customers can't take it.. So if u kindly remove the adds üôÇüôÉüôèüèª"
"the App by itself is awesome, the new UI is such good and simple and the player is perfect. But a good addition is if we could easily personalize our infos without being necessary open the website on a PC."
BEST OF BESTEST APP to listen adds. Top quality adds and sometimes songs come in between..but it's okay. They're not long enough to ruin your mood!! INSTALL THIS APP RIGHT NOW TO LISTEN SELF ROAST. Yeah they roast their own adds. I'm giving 4stars Because I don't like when songs interrupt while listening my favourite addvertisement. Hope you guys will. Work on it. Thanks for bringing us so much‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
"Great experience! the art, the music, the design and the access being the perfect piece to a high and deep adventure of listen and feel Spotify like a Marterpiece. Successful listen process to everybody."
"Found all my favorites and some good new music here. Commercials seem to be a fair trade off for good, free, guided music. Thanks Spotify."
"Edit: Great UI revamp, lot has changed since the last time. Things are less boxy and I love it. The only improvement I can think of is add a swipe down to minimize now playing."
Lots of great music on Spotify. Also many and varied artists to suit all tastes and preferences. There is lots of music for everyone. There is plenty of music for everyone to enjoy.
"Ive used spotify almost every day for the past 5 or so years, and i have only had a few issues that were quickly resolved. If i could give more than 5 stars, I would."
Only thing that could make this app better would be the ability to see all songs in your library. But it doesn't have to be perfect for me to say that Spotify Premium easily offers the best user experience of all music streaming services I've ever tried (as of the Spotify app's most recent updates). I'd highly recommend it to anyone.
Overall really good. A lot of pretty good updates recently. One thing that would be really cool is if you could duplicate other playlists made by other users. This way if someone made a playlist with a bunch of songs you liked except for maybe a few. You could duplicate your own version and make adjustments that make the playlist more suitable for you. It's hard to make these big 100+ song playlists. A duplication feature could cut that time to make the playlist down.
"With Spotify, now I am exploring and enjoying music more. This has been possible thanks to their intuitive UI, music quality, and the abundance of the titles available."
"Love listening to music and not having to click a button every 5 minutes to keep the music going. Plus, it's not nearly as battery draining as that ""other"" app."
Don't underestimate repetition please put a repetition button for ponds as well maybe you don't know how important it could be for a language learner. Other then that I'd say alright!
"Large variety of music. Because of the large number of songs available, it will be great if it could smoothly transition to the next song after a designated duration (2' or 3')."
"Really amazed to enjoy the quality of sounds as well as all easy to use ui, features and so on. It gave me 3 months premium services just because of I have Samsung Device and thanks goes to Spotify and Samsung."
It's a pretty good music app for streaming the only complaint I have is that you can't listen to what you want for free it plays simler songs but the song you want normally pops up pretty quick so it dinsy really matter
"I like audio quality, large catalog of songs and artists, UI and an option to download and listen to music offline. It is nice to have notifications from artists I follow."
"I love this app i play music while im doing house work, while at work, and in family gatherings i build my own folders n download and listen exactly to what I chose to listen too, i chose with no commercials, I love it."
While I love Spotify you have an issue with privacy 1. There is no block button there should be one for people you either don't wanna see or want to see your music 2. Even with the private playlist they are not actually private someone who is following you can see what your listening to and click the playlist your using and listen to it despite the private option I just wanna say music is very personal to the individual and privacy settings need to be updated ASAP
"Great app, well designed with ton of great features. Reduced one star after I tried Apple music, the loudness on Apple music is much more than Spotify without compromising music quality."
"Aside from the ads, the music was selected according to my tastes, and quite enjoyable and continuous, like radio."
It's a good app but I do wish that I could make my own Playlist and not have them add song similar to it. It is quite annoying but I still gave it a 5 because it showing me other songs that I've never heard since I barley listen to new music. But it still a great thing because you're able to look at other Playlist with is cool to listen to my friends music. They do have ads but that's in pandora as well so not such a surprise.
"The app is great but the customer service is amazing. Had some billing issues and contacted them thru chat on their web site. Had everything straightened out quickly and they issued a refund immediately. Good product backed up by good support, cant beat that."
"Everything is perfect, downloading should've been made easier and offiline mode should have looked more like an inbuilt music player app. Would recommend regardless."
"Been using Spotify for years, I have premium and I have to say it's just overall amazing. Genuinlyove this music app and it works on all phones ( I have Android so I'm not sure about Apple ) its kept all my favorite jams for a long time couldn't live life without it."
"Mixed reliability. I've the paid version. Recently the ""Now Playing"" screen is different than the music actually selected/playing. It requires a reinstall to reset. PITA!"
It's the greatest out there but it's not great. Some UI improvements are needed and they need to fix issues regarding loyalties of albums. Some core albums are missing like Pornography from The Cure..
"Spotfiy has literally changed the way I live life ahaha. Being able to download all my favorite songs, and discovering new favorites through the personalized playlists is so dank. Also, the fade out - fade in feature is really satisfying. However, the only thing I wish for, is a shuffle all type of button, because sometimes I really couldn't be bothered with looking for a song or a playlist to listen to."
"Overall a great experience with the app, though the ads sometimes get very annoying. And no I won't buy premium, quit asking."
"it's has all that i need in a music app. Good app ,UI is awesome than any other music application, audio quality is good even in non premiere version.Daily playlist is an awesome feature, album art is good."
"Less commercials than YouTube music, continues to.play when surfing the internet unlike YouTube . Automatically sends Playlist similarly to your tastes where you can pick the ones you like. 30 minutes ad free when you choose to listen to a commercial.ii have more than 5,000 songs on spodify and growing. I have Pandora,YouTube music and Spodyfy. Spodify is the best and easiest of all for building your music library and enjoying it bar none."
"Like most other people I have had Spotify for some time and I it quite fun but there are a few downfalls to it. One being after you have listened to some of the song for a while e.g. all star by smash mouth or something like that, it for some reason says it is playing the song you have put in but sounds a lot different as if it was a cover or a remix someone has done and it is very annoying as it has happened to me a few times now. I really don't like the remixes of the songs unless I want to."
One of the best Music Applications I have used in recent times.Not sure it's the best for Africa as it requires Data .If you can add lyrics it would be superb!
"Marvelous application it's design virtual , framework all are top notch , wide variety of artists and genres make it the best application for songs and as well as podcasts. You must be thinking why 4 stars instead of 5 that is because on slow internet speed the songs take too long to start and when they start the lyrics take too long to show up and are sometimes not in synchronisation with the song"
"I've been using Spotify for a while now since play music has been shut down and it alright I guess, you can listen to the songs you want when you want unless you have premium, amd after every 2 songs you get ads I don't mind the ads but they are quite frequent and it guess annoying. And it's annoying that in your playlist you can select which song you want to listen to. But I have to say that I had premium and I had no complaints but I can't afford it üò™"
"The app is great, but there's one problem. When running other apps, it can randomly stop running. I think this could be fixed by the notification being only able to be dismissed by a specific button, like Samsung Music."
"Keeps crashing when I begin to play Joe Rogan podcast and freezes everytime I close and open the app again. Then it forces me to uninstall and install again. Also I am really disappointed I get ads during podcast, I thought we get premium just to avoid them in the first place. Other than that I am quite satisfied with the app, but the crashing needs to stop. It's extremely annoying."
The UI is very good looking & the collection of songs is also great. But I have a suggestion please consider adding lyrics to the song.
Very nice app. Cheap and convenient. Audio quality is good for on the go but for listening with nice audio equipment at home is not enough. I'm waiting for Spotify lossless and then it will be 10/10 üòÅ
"I love Spotify. I recently purchased spotify premium, and it is like luxury. You can download music in high quality, and my speaker loves the amount of bass coming from this app. Hughley suggested."
"A huge Spotify fan boy here, I've been using it for years now and will never leave it. The UI is so slick compared to all the others that I've experienced. High fives all round to the Devs! ‚úãüèª"
Very nice üëåapp.Best app for listening to add free music and podcasts. The other thing I love about this app is its UI.Music quality is just awesome üëåand the best the thing I love is it's music suggestions for all types.
A great way to listen to favourites old and new. I can keep up with latest releases from artists I love to hear. Quite a few adverts but not a problem to me.
"""Random"" setting on playlists plays the same songs as well as liked songs. Not intuitive. Impossible to see last song played without restarting it. Prefer Pandora layout."
So far spotify has been my music spot. Have had the oportunity to be a premium user for a while and it was nothing short of being the best music spot for me. Easy tonuse and the customer support provided is there and on piont. Thanks and continue to keep up the good work. My name is Manuel Anguiano and im a Spotify user.
"It feels wonderful to listen to songs on this app.A wide range to suit all tastes and every age , it really is a very good and happy experience."
This Is a lot better than gaana and all other music apps but the ads make it a bit annoying please put that one long ad so we can get 30 min of continuous music its very annoying to get 2 double ads in between songs and that's the only issue with the app . The UI is amazing and clean and experience is also good
"Its a very suitable app for music lovers. But please slow down on the ads. Ive used spotify for 3 years now and its really frustarting. I would be in my vone, relaxing, then BOOM. My mood is ruined by a stupid ad!"
"Great app for all your music wants and necessities, but it would be nice to be able to have two accounts in case something happens to your mobile device requiring you to get another one because I have music on another account that I like to add to my current account or if that possible have two accounts."
It's a great music app and it's pretty easy to control it just needs a little more graphics for the background but all in all I use it almost everyday.
"Good service but UI and UX need work. The mobile search interface is very basic and rather than having to press on the hamburguer menu to add to play list. A multibox select would be nicer. The player is pretty basic . I have to reset the replay option everytime I switch songs manually. It is a good service, but it needs more thought and work."
"Im going to make this quick. There are no ads, and you can listen to the music without it having to be on ur screen and without ur device screen having to be on and much more!"
"The user experience isn't all that stream lined. It can be clunky at times. That being said, I use this app everyday and have been a consistent user for year because the service and content is great!"
"Incredible algorithm, but editing/managing playlists is so minimal it's tedious. Would need at least a checkmark selection system with ability to add multiple songs to a list & move multiple lists between folders. Bring back the ""play all playlists inside folder"" option. I would LOVE a quick way to remove current song from current playlist. I get that they don't want clutter, & steer users towards Spotify playlists instead, but such basic things should be standard. Brilliant AI though!"
"Easy to use... however giving it 4 stars because often it freezes, doesn't work and I have uninstall and install again ( which is quick!) especially when wanting to connect to my car system."
"I love this app, it is just amazing, I listen to Discover Weekly and like songs that I then download to my phone from liked songs. Well, I can't do that because all of my liked songs are automatically deleted or disappearing so I cannot download songs to my phone. I'm finding this really stressful because it's the thing I've been doing for ages now, and it's now being ruined. That's the only reason why I give 4 stars, not 5. It'd be 5 stars if I weren't for this thing that's happening. Pls fix."
"I like this app alot. Very convenient to just add songs I like to my playlist with the push of a button. However, I don't like how it plays 'suggested songs' and not my playlist. I just want to hear my liked songs, not similar songs. It's very annoying and frustrating."
"Love it. There's a lot of songs you can listen to. The only thing is the ads,they are quite annoying. But I love Spotify and use it almost everyday."
"I have been enjoying Spotify for over a year now. Love it. Only complaint I have is a play button glitch, but I did doesn't have the problem, and I can still play a different way."
The UI is perfect for me and the suggested playlists actually recommend music that's alone the lines of what I'd listen to. Glad I switched from Pandora.
I like this music app because of its lack of advertisement pauses. I also like it's intuitive suggestions for playlists. No more Pandora!!
"Hey spotify, a quick suggestion...if you could include an option of setting the frequency of either newest songs first or either older songs first in shuffle, it would be grateful. Thanks"
"Can't afford premium so we get alot and lots of those non required unnecessary free ads all the time.... As per my view, there's an continous popping of ads after every single song/music played. And then, this App's ads primary contents being generally with an aim Or else purposely goal to intentionally downgrade all those specific ad viewing individual of the unsubscribe premium' Spotifycommunity. IDK how other region's server works but honestly speaking this Adsucks it all here in IndianRegion"
Was great but since last update plays one song then turns off. Some improvement but would like a repeat button to play fav songs again and i don't like having songs added to my playlist that i didn't choose.
I really like Spotify but I see people complaining about shuffle being always on yet I can only play linearly. I want to play in shuffle but I don't even see a shuffle button or repeat button. Where are they?
Lately (since the last three updates) the app is running much more smoothly than before. It's just something I wanted to point out. The lags when playing a song or browsing though the catalog are rare now (they used to happen quite a bite before). Congrats to the excellent work.
"Brilliant app to serve songs along with true high quality sounds. It's not an app, it's a friend actually. Such a cool UI."
Good app. However its not very intuitive and accessing the sleep function a little long winded. As it's a function that most people will use it should be more direct. I do like the fact you get a daily selection based on what I previously listed to. All in all a good app.
Only one thing that shd be changed is that they put interfering adds and say tgat hear song without any interference So pls don't put too many adds Rest everything abt Spotify is just tooooo goood. All thanks to Spotify my lockdown has been going quite smoothly and pls give lyrics Everyone is getting lyrics but somehow I don't have lyrics on my Spotify app
"Overall is good but I have one bug/problem. When I open 1 album I cant play it, but when I click play it can and I already used the premium. I only can listen by using click the play button but not the song it self because the song it's dark like unavalaible from the display but it's there and playable."
"In general I love the app. But there is one small detail that bothers me a lot, it is hitting accidentally the ""unlike"" button and removing from liked songs. Some buttons have a notification to confirm, but others don't. Please make notifications for all, or better hide that button for already liked songs in order to be available only on the 3 point menu."
"My most used app. Spotify has replaced almost everything I use for listening to music. Simple clean interface and layout and almost any song I can think of. The premium version is great as it allows you to download songs and listen to them offline, although it is quite expensive"
"Great app,I have premuim and if you have the money it's well worth it. I'm on an old device which might cause issues, but it works well and I have only had to uninstall and reinstall once"
"I just think it's great to have such a vast repertoire, quite litterally, at your finger ( and ear ) tips. Long may it continue."
"Not as simple and straightforward as Google Music (RIP) but definitely not the cluttered counter intuitive shitshow that is Youtube Music, catalogue great, the lists and suggestions interesting etc..."
"Best music app ever - I love to listen music daily and Spotify has made easier for me to listen to latest songs, download them and play offline without worrying about sorting and finding them on multiple devices. I love the UI and everything, but it'll be better if they 'll introduce a new widget for Android users cuz the current one looks pretty old styled."
"It's easy to use and is free! Getting premium is optional and not required. To rap it all up, this is a great app that you should try. I just wish I could pick the exact song I wanna hear."
this app is the best. has every song i want to listen. and all of the artists i requested earlier are now on Spotify. thank you! and iknow you guys want to make money but please lower the ads. I'm in love with the new UI.
By far the best designed music streaming app out there! My favourite feature is the ability to use my phone as a remote while I listen on other devices. I highly recommend Spotify.
"New UI is great, finally put search back at top of playlists without hiding under a button and new playbutton is streamlined. First UI update in a long time that wasnt a step backwards!"
Spotify is one of the best apps for music on the market. With the option to create your own unique playlists as well as have them built around your own personal musical tastes...you cant beat that. You are able to follow artists you enjoy as well as other folks who enjoy the music you do. Only suggestion I have is a chat option. You also have podcasts here. Michele Obama and Barack have two of the best ones on here. It's like listening in on conversations with family members.
Autoplay is not working. Hope the developer will review and fix the bug. Besides that the widget needs to be redesigned.
"Brilliant app with very good suggestions, very smooth experience of the app maybe too smooth. Customisation of user experience in the app is the one thing I found lagging. And would love to see these additions; 1. Seperate tab for podcasts. 2. Should be able add whole/selected songs to user playlist 3. Lyrics maybe? and More info on artist/arts. 2021 Lyrics are in ! üôå"
"There are many sites available for the use by individuals with discrimanating taste in music.Many of these sites are not in the highest of catalog,though many are great ,for my listening requirements the hard to obtain is sometimes in my requests.Spotify without compair can fullfill your need.Take a chance and try to stump them,good luck!"
"Very good app, Free version not worth it. Upgrade to premium, way better experience and no ads or shuffle. I love Spotify overall, Good UI and musical experience."
"This app is amazing, all I do is listen to music all day and don't get interrupted at all, with premium it's amazing, although it does drain the battery to my phone quite a bit"
"it good I guess the one problem I have for it is the ui for playlists on android look so bad. Like they look fine on apple just port that look over to android. Update, they made it look good."
"All time best ! Spotify is just the best music app. Really good UI , accurately recommends songs according to your music taste. The reason I am giving 4 stars is because √ó) It does not always give you 30 mins ad free music when you see an ad. That is hella annoying √ó) Song pauses automatically , tho it is really rare it still does happen."
"The app used to be great when I first started using it and it won't even allow me to login and I'm paying for it...I've to delete all my data on the app just to be able to log in again, this is a massive inconvenience, not to mention the money I've wasted paying for it the last couple of months, and the data costs involved as I've tried to rebuild my 1000+ song music catalogue."
Great app. Even the free version is great. I think Spotify should add a built-in Equaliser for the speakers when using a Bluetooth speaker
It is really disgusting to download each song by taping the three dots button. I think there should have a download button while I play the song. Thank u
This is my second time for having Spotify I had another phone and lost it had to cancel Spotify get it again after about a year and a half I lost my whole playlist I hope to get it back if not I'm going to build a new one and I'm confident Spotify has all the music I need to listen to they are very good before and I'm confident that having it on my new phone it will be just as good music can save a person's soul or even his life at the most inappropriate time you think if you hear it in the back
"Ever since discovering Spotify I've never looked back. Not one for ads popping up and not being able to skip songs, I've subscribed and never regretted it since. It's my go-to for the gym, cruising, doing chores. Definitely recommended."
I have been using Spotify for years and have loved it. The most recent update is not working correctly. It's glitches all the time. I hope they fix this quickly.
"I love the app. I've had premium for like 5 years now and I've never had problems with it, it's really well built. I just wish, just one thing, that you are able to queue recently played songs(in search tab). Same like the options when you regularly search up a song. Like hold down the song the recently played song that you want to queue and it will give up the options. That's just one thing I would really like."
"I absolutely love Spotify! The UI, the recommendations, the features! I was very sceptical about buying the premium, but it's totally worth it! 100%. Never leaving Spotify for any other music app. Team Spotify for life :p If there was a DM feature where I could share songs with my friends directly, it would definitely be a great addition."
Quite a friendly app with lots of options to keep your selected songs. Quick and easy search for songs which is a great thing for music lovers.
"Premium user over here. the app is incredibly slow, it stopps and removes the downloaded songs on its own. the graphics are orrible, not to mention not functional. the previous one was the best. and last thing, in 2019, we still can't change our username nor the playlist cover image/ user image unless we're using the desktop app"
"i love this app because it continues to get better. they improve the ui very often, making it easier to navigate and find new music. the aspect I want them to focus on moving forward is the social aspect and adding customization to the profiles to give more purpose to viewing and following other users. I can trust Spotify to move forward and commit to improving their already great app which is why it is miles ahead of their competitors."
"Please re design the filters! I'm sick of the filters resetting! I just want to see whats in my downloads and not everything together. Also, when changing to other downloaded pod casts can u make it start the next pod cast by date? I mean if I'm listening 5o may8th and i want it to go to may 9th. Instead the next episode starts at june 23rd the newest pod cast. Bahh"
"Spotify offers best-in-class features and an intuitive user experiences, paired with an extremely expansive selection of music and podcasts. Unfortunately, it's a bit lacking in the sound quality department if you're looking for audiophile-grade streaming. I wanted to yield them a 4.5 but u fortunately cuz it isnt available i gave them a 5 after a round off:) Overall this app is blessing for all of using it out there in the world. And yea one supreme thing is to buy the premium for ezz:)"
"It's on my phone, TV and computer all synced up, and I use the free version. No, the ads are not like Saavn nagging after each song. Though I have an annual subscription for Wynk, I use this one as my primary because of its UI and nicely segregated content. Be it Android Auto or Shazam, every standard interface has its plug in. Customised playlists of random users, new releases of my preferred artists and genres, etc."
"Love ability to make playlists for any and every occasion! Adding, moving or removing songs is quick and simple. Spotify is the only music app I use and the price is right, even for Premium."
I love Spotify. I tried all the other options available and decided on Spotify as it has a great variety of music to stream that suits my music tastes.
"Best fun Best music Best Everything Something for everyone ~~~~~ Only quibble, finding the people who make the playlist could be a lot easier It's currently far too complex for a simple brain like mine."
"Great app. Super user friendly and intuitive. Amazing selection of music, podcasts, etc. Only issue I have is they have chosen to disable the ability to play my old iTunes play lists. Which I understand business wise but it was nice for the consumer."
"Extremely intuitive and easy to navigate. The layout is straight forward, downloading is fast and all in all, runs smoothly. Strongly recommend it."
"I love Spotify but I hate the new update! It's awful. I can't find my saved albums anymore when I go to an artist and am instead directed to their homepage. Also who came up with the idea of filter the search for playlists, artists, albums podcasts instead of having them be tabs/ buttons? Awful üòû pls change it back or update it to something better!"
"Big fat meaty 5 stars to spotify! Smooth streaming, great ui, offline play and personalized music discovery options make spotify even better than illegal pirating options for music. My one and only app review goes to the app I use every single day."
"This app has been my top choice for playing music for a long time and has been doing a good job. But recently, that experience has suffered quite a lot. The app is being extremely buggy lately and is making the app borderline unusable at times. And based off of other recent reviews of this app, I'm not the only one experiencing issues like this. Random crashes, stops playing music, and redownloading songs that have been download for a long time."
"I use the free version. It's very good. For sure the premium version is better, without apps and designing your own lists..."
Its a really cool app...i like this app but u need he premium version for better experience. I'm not really happy that u can't skip music without paying for it. But other than that's its quite ok
"Removing a star because you took away the widget feature. One of my favorite things about this app was the homescreen widget. Made it way safer to navigate through my music while drivig because I didnt have to make any extra gestures to get to my next song or to turn shuffle mode on. And heads up, UConnect 4 in my Dodge doesn't mesh well with this new version. Can't operate Spotify on any of my center console buttons. Google music works just fine so I can't say for sure whats up."
"The is one the best, most entertaining, the very best music app you can ever have on your device. Just a little amount to become a premium user, and Stream songs unlimited songs. So if you're a new user, hit that download button. Kudos to the developers."
Excellent App for international songs and Fluid UI. Only thing hinders the app is the frequency of the ads. Like 3 ads one after another is horrible experience for end user.
A genuinely fantastic app that obviously cares as much about music as its users do. The only reason it doesn't have five stars is because for a lot of my larger playlists when I try to shuffle them I seem to get the same collection of songs playing rather than the many other songs on the playlist that haven't been played as much
"I've always been able to find my music I want to listen to right away, very quickly. I have the utmost love and respect for this music app (Spotify: Listen to Music you Love)."
"I can find music to listen to while I'm playing games, chatting, or watching movies, and I've never been a fan of country music üé∂until 1995 when my guests were visiting family and friends. I let them take over the music üé∂ and I have been a country fan since.i still love my rock and I will listen to the music quite often, especially when I'm alone. I definitely recommend that you try it. 4.5‚òÜs"
5 stars easily but I do have a small problem with the ads. I have premium now but back when I didn't I would turn up my volume a bit at night to hear the music and then an ad for the military with guns blazing and people screaming would pop up on a sleep sound playlist. Other then that it's amazing. They really should try to have more quiet ads on playlist like that
"I'd give it 4¬Ω really, but sometimes the app will randomly close and make me listen to songs from the start again and I can't afford premium so it's quite irritating, also the home page layout is slightly awkward- But yeah pretty good app in general, audio is high quality and it's a very nicely designed layout."
"App not showing in notification panel after the update. In app play buttons aren't being displayed sometimes and are not in sync with Google speaker. Also Observed frequent disconnections with google home speaker after recent updation. Songs are not syncing as well with respect to the speaker playing on Spotify app. App was good before the last two updates, Last two updates have ruined the flawless experience of spotify. Thinking to opt out from the premium service."
"Very happy with Spotify for the most part. Some software issues & some menu options are not user friendly or intuitive. Also, I have a premium membership but still get ads on podcasts (It took a long time to get customer service to respond to this issue) & Although I understood the reason why it's still disappointing since I paid for the membership in order to not have ads (maybe posting that fact @ point of purchase?) Other than those couple issues, I think Spotify is awesome!"
Finally a proper UI update in around 5 years. Don't move the playlist search bar from where it is again. I've been waiting for it for too long.
This application is designed greatly and it's too nice. The cool thing about this application is there is almost no annoying ads and that's why I love this. I faced only a problem when I put a playlist in Google's Alarm application it's not working . I don't know whose is creating problem Spotify or Google's Alarm app. Please solve it.
"Pretty good for the most part. There have been quite a few songs though that Spotify does not have, which can be frustrating when you're paying for a service."
"edit* Love the new GUI Bugs(not sure if fixed, will update) *Sometimes music played before wont play when play is pressed. I have to skip the song and come back to it for it to play. *Sometimes downloaded songs wont play. *Sometimes, when offline, downloaded playlists wont play music and sometimes wont even load. *When offline it takes ages for downloaded music to load as well as show."
Thank you so much for this excellent app. This app is so carefully designed for all music lovers. I am enjoying it even when the network is slow that too free. I sometimes feel guilty that I am enjoying all these goodies without spending a penny. But don't worry I will upgrade my membership to premium one of this days.
It has a wide music variety and is all around great. I have premium and it is totally worth it in my opinion. Granted it doesn't have EVERY single song but it has quite a lot of songs.
Spotify is the Netflix of Music Streaming. The algorithm truly is exceptional in coming up with reccomendations. The UI is really smooth even when you want it to work across devices. It doesn't have annoying lags. On the whole this probably has all the music you're looking for plus more and really well put together playlists to keep you exploring.
"I got this app and some wireless earbuds on a whim after my mood and mental state started to worsen at work with the consistent pestering of co workers trying to tell me every single little detail going on in their lives for hours at a time instead of getting their work done, then bugging me to help them. This app has definitely brightened my mood and I don't have to listen to them unless they're asking genuine questions! Thank you Spotify for being my new peace of mind!"
"The UI is good, although Please add an option to download individual tracks . and integrate a light theme if it's possible. then add an option to see lyrics real time instead of those short peek videos, i think it's useless no one listen to music by looking into those videos. then add an option to search song by lyrics it will be a huge help. There is a huge gap in market of audiobooks. you can add regional audio books into ur library and solve my prblm of subscribing audio books apps ."
"I have premium, and it's quite amazing, and for a while i didn't have premium, and they gave us a lot of apps, but the family premium account is pretty affordable for 6 premium accounts so i rate it 5 stars. You can see what others are listening to and download podcasts and songs and create ur own playlists"
Pretty good generally. Every now and then it gets in this writer's state where it pauses playing until you turn the screen back on on your phone. Restarting the phone seems to fix it. It also takes ages loading up podcast episode menus and such quite often. Overall it is pretty clunky but provides a great resource.
Hands down the best possible experience i could ever expect from a streaming site i love when i pick a song and it intuitively picks the next ones as if its literally reading my mind i have ranted exhaustively to many people how much i absolutely love it! I hate that its always listening to you when its on though
"I think 10 dollars is a bit too expensive, and radio button is a bit far away. Desktop app has some bugs, we need a 64 but version of Spotify for PC not a 32 but one..... otherwise it's 5 Stars üòç"
"I'm definitely satisfied with Spotify, I've bend and loyal fan for quite some time now. I'm definitely and huge jazz fan, and I love about Spotify you can pick your favorite and also there artists you made not yet herd of to get and chances to spotlight them and add to your collection I definitely recommend Spotify to my family and friends."
"Love creating my own Playlist, no ads, unlimited skips and the family plan is a great bargain. Theres been some glitches but they are fixed pretty quickly. Love that they've made casting so easy."
I don't really like the UX changes in the last version. It takes a lot more effort to scroll through the 30 or so auto-generated playlists. Overall I like the app but I wish the UI was either more customizable or tuned more towards usability.
I love this app. I am taking piano lessons and it is very helpful to be able to quickly find the song and listen to it as many times as you need to. It also suggests other music that I may like that I would have never found on my own
I have Spotify premium. The downloaded songs gets deleted and requires fresh download everyday. Also a lot of issues like app not starting and currently playing music track getting paused on its own.
Very convenient and has lots of music. Their music discovery system is excellent. Sound quality is quite good too if you max it out in the settings.
"Love the app! But sometimes play/pause button doesn't always work, especially when rotating phone from horizontal to vertical and vise versa"
"Liked the free version just fine but then needed to build a collection of music to download for when I'm out of cell service and am pretty happy now listening commercial free and unlimited skips. The software tries to recognize your taste in music as well, then recommends songs and artists which is pretty awesome to hear new music I wouldn't any other way"
"Loved the experience of playing music on Spotify. Their subscription is also such that it does not burn a hole in your pocket. Also they do not reduce the quality of music just because we are not subscribed to them. Their ads are also designed really well, it's quite fair when they say 'watch this short video and get the next 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening'."
"UI could use some tweaks, and it recently changed its ability to play a set song in a playlist as a starting point; now it just plays a snippet. Shuffle wasn't available at the start, now it's the primary. Good overall but not overly intuitive."
"The best app when it comes to listening. The song recommendations are top notch. The UI is just too good. And every 6 months spotify will give stats about our listening too. And it has podcasts too. Almost every single podcasts I have listened before are available here. So I switched to Spotify now. All this good experience with the free version. Yes, there will be ads often if you're using the free version like me but it's worth to buy the premium version. And it tempts me to go for premium."
"Still the most stable version of the application for a while. I have occasional hiccups with the interface not missing and staying as a black screen. I dislike the fact the ""like"" heart is right next to the pause button, it can be accidentally pressed far too easily, removing said song from your library. I would prefer for prices to not rise once again. Aside from that all is good."
Spotify is a great platform for music or podcasts Even without premium. Although you still get ads they aren't usualy that long (like 10-30 seconds Max) and then you can listen to a few songs before you get another one. Premium offers the same but more without the ads which is quite Nice. I would deffenetly recomend since premium isnt too expensive (like 15$ a month)
"The app is really nice! There's a huge choice of songs. Everything is perfect except one thing. Suddenly my button stop/play became white, and I can't return ordinary button. What can i do, help me please!"
"Just joined with a family account. So far good. 4* because screen sometimes freezes and playing details don't update when quickly moving on to next tune. Cleared cache etc, restarting the phone does not help."
"Next time chose the featured ADS. Do me a favor to remove the Creamsilk ads saying ""napabayaan"" seriously, someone had a heart attack when she heard the ads for the first time and its night time. I dont want to hear a horrifying sound of a helpless in the middle of the night scaring people to death. This is not a kind of stragegy of your company just to force everyone to subscribe to premuim? hell no. uninstalling the app. I feel sorry for my friend she passed away. May she rest in peace."
"Spotify is phenomenal, there's no argument about that but some times it just stops and I think a more suitable version of all devices needs to be made without removing any other features and graphics"
"I love music and this my most favourite app on the phone. First things first, music quality is awesome. Then the UI is aesthetic. Awesome personalization. Get to follow other people and listen to their playlists. So many types of categorisation. Best app for music."
"Like the app but I dont like it when the paus button and forward/backwards buttons shows on screen in the backgrond when the app is closed, I can see it better when I open some apps with white background, its good that it doesnt show when you take a screenshoot"
"I love this app so much,I love that I can see other artists and hear their music it's a good app and I even went premium and it's a good thing I got this app so soon all my favorite music at a tap of a button it's the best wow no problems at all oh and I like that I can save all my favorite songs on one playlist."
I find this app way better than pandora unlike pandora u can create playlists and play certain songs for free withouit paying for a subscription to do so however there is alot of ads which i expect because its free to use and optional to buy premuim like most free games or apps people should expect to see ads when its a free app or game (other than stuff like hulu or disney + ect)
free spotify has tons of commercials but for 9 bux a month all that goes away there's not very much I've searched and didn't find overall I have no complaints I have an android and the app works just fine for me
Nice app and easy to use. Algorithm is flawless too but can i wish there is a block button where i can block certain people from seeing my playlist since music is very personal to me and i dont feel comfortable sharing to everyone what im listening to specially when Im going through something.
"*Changed Review to 4 Stars as they have reverted app back to old format. New update to the Mobile UI is ridiculously BAD „Äätldr: each home page category now only shows 1 ""tile"" this means you loose 90% of you easily navigatable options. What this really means is unless you want to listen to only the one ""made for playlist"" or music you have already listened to or you are out of luck. Absolutely everything now has to be done through the search tab. All BAD."
I have used Spotify for 5 years now and it is incredible. After trying almost every major competitor- I always return. However there's only 2 features that will surely cancel out what the competitors offers 1. The option to switch between a 'light' mode as the UI is only in black and 2. The option to download songs individually without having to add them to a playlist and then download. The best music app out there ! A must have. Work on light/dark mode pleaaaaseüòÅ
"A world of sound!!!!! Endless variety of music, stories, podcasts and entertainment all through a classy provider. An audible compact design, and all at ears reach!!!! Its money well spent for the audiophile."
"I uninstalled several weeks ago. First I want to thank you for saving my lists.This is my most favorite app.I live on a mountaintop in TN.in beautiful place God made and forgot.The bad thing is that it is impossible to get quality internet service.I look forward to day when i find way to better signal. Some days is struggle to do anything here.I keep sound off cause songs won't play thru.Download time for 1 song unreal. If you love music,this is place to be! RayHo back in building folks!!!"
This is a well made app for music it let's you design your own playlists and makes playlist based on what you listen to all in all this is a great app for music even if you dont have premium
"It's a great app, however it sometimes does crash (at least for me) and when using the app when listening to music on windows 10 Spotify app, the lines for the time in the songs doesn't sync up that well and requires some effort to get the times to match when wanting to use the behind the lyrics on mobile."
"Update: the app has improved and worked better over time, even though there are slight improvements to go. I migrated to spotify due to JRE, and this app needs some attention to allot of bugs. I cant listen to a single podcast without constantly dealing with self pausing, button play/pause mismatch, app constantly gos back to main screen and i have to go through the whole process to pause it...."
All I can say is i would like to have a dislike button for a certain bands. So you don't have to go hide certain songs in the playlists you can just dislike the band.
Finding music that caters to your style has never been more easier to find. Great app design and interface coupled with plenty of in depth configuration settings makes Spotify probably the best music app you can find.
"Overall very happy with Spotify. But, over the past year or two, something must've changed with their algorithm and it isn't quite as good as it used to be."
"I don't like a lot of the recent UI updates, and it can be glitch. But overall, a great music app Highly Recommend"
"Affordable, reliable, and honestly a really good platform. Had YouTube music (that comes with YouTube Premium) for quite awhile then one day a PERMANENT adult filter was added to EVERYTHING (no more explicit music, content, and YouTube videos). I am 20 years old and pay for my services. Was not pleased with YouTube after this. I did not receive any help either. It was stuck. And even currently my YouTube account won't let me watch pretty much anything:/. But this platform is really great."
"Easy to use, seems to have a greater inventory than some of the other excellent systems. Creating Playlist and finding them in the library is quick and simple."
"Would have been 5 star but since an update it's 4. quick offline mode taken away from the drop down drawer....now I have to go in to the app to go offline. *Edit - now 3 stars as they've now removed the widget! I've seen nothing new, only taking features away! *2nd edit...back to 4 stars as the widget is back."
"Great range of music. In fact quite literally 'Something for everyone!"" It sometimes has a few hiccups which are resolved by pausing and un-pausing and the obvious adverts every half hour, but going for the basic free subscription like myself it's a small price to pay. I can see it being problematic if you're forking out a few quid for full access though"
the quick settings media control panel in Android 11 acts wonky from time to time. It just disappears. Thank you for bringing back the queue and adding recently played.
"I wish they had a built-in feature to play audio files downloaded on a device so I didn't need a separate music app. But the app does everything it sets out to do and does it well, so it still deserves 5 stars"
I mean it is my go to app for all my music listening. And i listen to music at least 4-8 hrs a day. Problem is on mobile i got an issue with the player. I was listening to a podcast and now the music player ui is bugged. It is stuck on that one episode nomatter what music im playing. Music plays fine but i cant really use some features such as skipping ahead
"Amazing, Amazing, and Amazing control of what you want to listen to. Choices of Genre and types of songs are endless. The GUI is awesome. The ability t organize all of your songs is out of this world..Kudos Spotify....."
"I have been using Apple Music, Deezer and Yandex.Music before. And Spotify is the best music app for me! It works perfect, has the biggest library of the music and has the greatest design. The multi-device sync is crazy, cause I can control music playing on one device using another and I use often So I highly recommend it for you)"
"My Favourite Music app! I have tried many other apps available there and believe me it's the best; with the best UI,quality music,easy controls and comparatively less annoying ads..Hit the Install button now.."
"For a second, Spotify had a design change today and I'm sure I didn't dream it but it was awesome but then it disappeared so I decides to update the app thinking that was it but the cool design is gone. Dafuq?"
I enjoyed setting my own playlist finding phones that I haven't heard and quite a long time so many variety you have to choose from is there a way that I can get this without having to renew my prescription every month how about you just run until I stop it that's what I like that's what I would enjoy
"Everything is great. Although thwre is one little problem that is concerning me. Whenever I turn my Redmi phone into dark mode, the play/pause button becomes invisible. I know this is not a big deal, but it is kinda annoying for me. Would be glad if you could fix that."
"Great app for Android Update 5/26/21: using Spotify app on Samsung galaxy note ultra 20 running Android. App stops playing podcast at random times. The ""now playing"" bar at bottom of the screen shows inaccurate podcast title and is intermittently non-functional (pause/play buttons)."
It's always slow to do what I want it to do. Lately it will show a different title then the song I'm on. It doesn't automatically update even though I have it set to automatic. It's still a great app but apps like YouTube music could quickly make spotify null
"I don't know what you guys did with the new update but I can't even scroll through my music or podcasts anymore. Everything is out of order and it seems like the sort button keeps getting pressed every time I try to look through anything. It jumps around from top to bottom and won't load right when I click on a podcast or song. It also has been force closing. Please look into it, I love this app, pay for it and use it every day."
I am a Wynk user. Downloaded Spotify and found the music quality is awesome and UI design is great. Lakhs of songs. Became a premier member now. Uninstalled Wynk.
Very good app. Could definitely use a find button in each library. Also a way of sorting the songs by artist or title within the library would bring my review up to 5 stars.
"Simple, intuitive interface, amazing music suggestion and playlists, great audio quality and other features. Brilliant app."
I love listening to music on this app my favorite thing is that there's not that many ads and you have a choice that you don't have to listen to ads for 30 minutes I love this and it's so quick to install I hope other people have a great experience with the app just like I did I'm a hundred percent team Spotify
"Easy to build up and keep library, free to play any song on desktop. I used to be broke and didn't have much money Spotify always let's you listen to your music even if you don't have money. Keep your libraries forever, anywhere. It's been great I can like songs and come back. Think I've been using Spotify since my freshman year 2017, now graduated and got a whole nostalgic trip of lists of songs I like. Spotify was always the best deal, you get much more than any music streaming competitor."
"The interface, options and features are quite satisfying in this app. Also, the way they show ads without harshly interrupting the listener feels somewhat peaceful. They also cover good to excellent music library in all languages. If you're fond of listening to English music then you're at the right place. I recommend Spotify over any other apps like Jiosaavn and/or Wynk."
Best of breed. I've tried others but still keep coming back to a company that does music streaming really well. App is ready to use and the UX is pretty friendly.
"Seem less, well built software. Spotify covers everything from podcasts to weather to any music you like live versions rare versions they tend to have everything"
OK spotify I'm paying for premium I should be able to open the app and play my music without having to wait. There's an annoying glitch that's been going on for some time now every time I open the app it says I have no internet connection and I'm forced to wait for it to buffer or load up and realize that I am connected to a network.. You guys need to fix this issue. Apparently it's happening to quite a few people so it's not just me or a problem with my phone it's a problem with the app.fix it
Easy to search for and play music and podcasts. I like the fact that it uses wi-fi and Bluetooth for connecting to google speakers as well as headphones. My only wish is that when trying to use my entire home network to play throughout the home there is no guidance on how to achieve this
"Impressive music catalog, across genres and languages. Paid subscription is a must for a fluid experience. Premium prices could be a bit better."
"It's so good, and useful for music listeners, Unless they are familiarise on how to get through it all, very beautiful songs, that for years, I couldn't get all in one copy, (rather use to get link from other sources) But this one is very useful and it's related to our kind of music samples, before we can ""save"" to my own playlist album. No doubt, add at a time of few songs, (what do we expect?, E'thing free ?)Better than radio Helps for my music learning in guitar,violin,flute,harmonica,piano"
"Its a decent music listening with a lot of options, but if youve been using the app for 3+ years like me the constant weird ui changes get annoying and it makes things cluttered and confusing more often than not."
"Been away for a year with Amazon Unlimited but like others I've tried, its messy, buggy and the playlists are poor. This is like picking me songs much more my taste and also the app and whole thing is better. The only thing is amazon was cheaper but id pay the 2 quid extra for a song on demand that I search for on tap rather than try and hunt the album or song. It's the best for mobile as if I wanted higher quality tracks eg WAVS, I'd buy them or something. Its also on my PS4 too, more options"
"The best ever, all the music and songs i love, including the most beautiful quiet piano and oldies such as Jim Reeves, etc and the quality of the recordings is stunning. Thank you SPOTIFY!"
"Amazing app, it has all the songs I beed, even some really obscure ones. The integration with other devices is amazing, the ui is clean, and it's everything I could ask for."
it used to be quite minimum but now ads are getting out of the hand. edit : finally available in my country! price is quite reasonable. few songs are disabled though.
the indian app is no where like the original one. there is no shuffle play button no radios nothing. there are only advertisements for premium every two songs. many songs are missing from the original database.
"Did interns design the UI? (1) The ""Search"" tab is difficult to navigate because it's an illogical mess, like ""Dance/Electronic"", ""Mood"", ""Frequency"", and ""EQUAL"" are literally right next to each other. I usually look for playlists based on music genres, and witnessing ""Higher Ground"" mixed with ""Metal"" and ""Punk"" hurts my eyes and my brain. (2) ""Your Library"" tab is a mess with filter options like a shopping website instead of a tidy curation. I can't find peace even in my own library. Unfair."
Great app but expensive for the ability to skip tracks.. All in all the functions and options all work well on my device and I do like how it functions quickly and personally I've never really had any major issues force closes or lagging while loading my playlists and podcasts.. Would get more stars but for the expense..
"Spotify aims at a good user experience. There are features that are missing considering a music app but the fetures that are present works flawlessly. And combined with its large database of music I think it is easily ahead of other similar apps like Gaana, Wynk, Apple Music. The only reason I would choose to use other app is the price."
"It's very easy to make a playlist but if you don't have premium you get like 2 songs then 4 adds, that gets very annoying very quick."
17 may - anyone with sync across devices issue JUST REINSTALL THE APP & IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM. It worked perfectly for couple of years until the recent updates messed it up. The real-time synching among devices is so messed up. I loved the feature of continuing my music be it I'm listening to it on PC & have to go out but still continue with it. But it's all messed up now. 17 May 2021: 1 star. Now can't even access my library after recent update.
Absolutely great music app till date. I switch the app because it's interfere is very easy to use and just click on play button then enjoy to seamless music.
"I rate spotify 4 stars cuz i wont lie, you guys algorithm is too good. But please, could we be allowed to download individual songs??? And also, individual releases should be treated as singles and not albums with just 1 song in them. It messes up the whole experience for offline listening. Thanks alot. Also i would like some changes to the UI/UX, could it be more interactive and nicer looking with a little elements here and there?"
"Hi, the app is great, can you consider making the car mode option available when playing music either in the 3 dot options or as an icon on the UI while music is playing, I realized that I always had to go to settings to change it when driving and when I get home I have to change back to the normal settings, thanks!"
"Great app! Great UX! Two suggestions though: 1. Whenever we listen to a playlist, the next time we click on it, all the songs that haven't been listened to should automatically come on top. 2. We need a 'Listened' button next to 'Liked' button cause sometimes we only want to keep in mind that we've listened to this song but don't want to add it to 'Liked' songs. Thanks!"
"Awesome way to listen to music but there are quite a few gaps in selection if you want to listen to music from countries outside of North America and Western/Central Europe, especially for traditional forms."
"Don't really love this app, but, could be a replacement for other apps which requires WiFi. With Spotify, I don't need WiFi to play. But, it imposes it's own musics on me when I don't want..."
"Happy with most of the app. I wish that I could simply hit the ""thumbs down"" button from any window rather than sometimes having to go into the menue to do it."
"Best music streaming out there. App UI/layout navigation is a little cluttered though. Especially with the latest update, the library/playlist/artist etc. are mixed together in one list and you need to tap on (poor)filters to actually pick one category. That's an unnecessary 2-3 steps"
I like this app very much. But there should be a option for replay music. As if you play it in background and do something else in your phone and when the song finishes you need to replay it but there isn't a button for that. You have to open the app and replay. I love this app. Please add this feature. I love it great app. Thanks
The new library is absolutely outstanding Mind blowing free app to listen all the songs in all languages and podcasts. Continuing to love this app as for the last 6 years üëçüëçüëçüëå
The experience?... Best (Just use the paid version and you are good to go) It's so versatile and I have not problem accessing it from my different devices and continuing to listen to the song that I was listening to.
Amazing app. In Spotify Lyrics showing well in Indian language songs. But in Musixmatch don't show Lyrics with Indian language songs in Android. Musixmatch Lyrics working well in Windows but Spotify does not show lyrics in Windows. . Add some new features- - Lyrics design (colors etc. like Musixmatch) - Word by work Lyrics
"I have such a great experience with spotify. I am student and Spotify comes with such a low price that I can afford easily and its adjustable with my pocket money. If we talk about music, Spotify has a large number of artist and their tracks. The also have many categories of different moods. I really recommend this app. Spotify offer different price plans and you can choose which suites you the most. I am lovin' it. More food than SoundCloud"
Overal love Spotify but I don't love the recent update to the library. The filtering system means I have to click many buttons to get to my downloaded podcast episodes. They're not the same as New Episodes. And when I do filter down to downloaded podcasts I still have to click into the podcast to find the episode. Music and podcasts are very separate for me and this mixes them all together and it's hard to find what I want. Hopefully this feedback helps in upcoming developments.
"A great app for mucic lovers but the only small dislike of these app is about the most ads.As for every two to three songs there is an ad and even the ads have skip option but the design,performance, playlists,songs collection are awesome."
Spotify makes into my Top 3 apps in the world which I can't live without. Interactive UI and visual experience is undeniably industry leading ! Great Great Great service üëåüëç 5/5 Stars
"Great app and great service overall. But. The ""Behind the Lyrics"" system works in a completely non-intuitive way, it tries to pack too much ‚Äî facts about the song and real-time lyrics and misses both shots for me. Also, most of the songs don't show the lyrics at all which is sad."
"Amazing app for music; wide variety if stuff for a guy like me who listens to all types of music. It also has great podcasts, so I don't get bored in class and I can just stop paying attention XD. They're even self-conscious about how much ads suck, unlike mobile games or other websites that want to shout them from the rooftop. Premium is a little expensive ($10/month), but well worth it. This is BUILT for music and podcasts, and by hell does it succeed."
"Great App. This app is great for my purpouses, you can listen to the music you want whenever! Although when you are looking for music to listen to out and about look elsewhere, you cant listen to music offline :( But if you get Spotify Premium, you can download music and listen to it ad free. The ads are quite annoying, and one thing i have been noticing is when i listen to my playlist, it always shuffle plays ( unless you are listening on desktop) its not a big problem but hope they fix it soon"
"I love Spotify because, it's easy to search for the songs, it's easy to build your playlist and I love that it makes suggestions based on your taste of music. I'm a 60s-70s child and love that they have a huge play list of bubblegum music. It's nice to remember my teenie bopper days of youth listening to the likes of Tony DeFranco, Leif Garrett, Shawn Cassidy and Bobby Sherman! ü•∞"
Had premium for 5 years. I love it! No regrets! 2021 edit: The new update is kinda garbage. I hate it. It doesn't work too well on mobile. Can you fix this or revert back to the old design?
I am using spotify since a very long time and its quiet a decent app to use on a daily basis for music and podcasts . Although sometimes it frustrates a lot .
"It's Kool, but I wish adding songs to playlist was a maximum of 2 step operation. egg: a + button on the current track playing screen tap and select playlist title to add the song that is currently playing. Thnx"
Great app for music lovers. The UI is easy to comprehend plus the suggestions are good too. I even liked how they categorise each years top Hits. No isuues so far with searching for my favourite songs. A thanks for the Spotify team.
I am using it for quite some time ... I expected it to reduce the number of adds ... But now it shows 2-3 adds after a song ... It's REALLY REALLY FLUSTRATING ... I would have bought the premium ... But now I won't ... JUST BECAUSE IT SHOWED SO MANY ADDS !! ... But ... Adds aside ... The app is good ... And I can find a lots of various daily mixes ... And all ...
"well, i used spotofy sonce 2016, and about 2-3 month ago i used the premium spotify. I like how UI spotify, it's so simple, but sometimes i can't play a song in my laptop, and i can't share song on instagram stories. I wish spotify can be better next time"
"Important info for those who are facing annoying critical Spotify music play interruptions, in my case once I executed April-2021 Android firmware update, the Facebook app started fall down with automatic restart while all running apps including Spotify was affected. It was happening in phone absolutely quietly, just all apps stopped and restarted w/o any warning many times per hour, incl. Spotify. Once I disabled Facebook app the issue immediately disappeared."
The best music app in the universe with spotify connect its one of the best app in playstore a way way better than other apps in playstore that are frod and show you only ads less music. 10001% satisfaction from the builders. Spotify premium membership is also value for money no extra cost full value i am love with this app.
"Once upon a time, long time ago, there was this quick feature for making it appear the search bar, with just scrolling more towards up when reached at the top, rather than mentally torturing click 'menu' button and find the 'search' option to make it appear. This is a one neat clear move of downgrading."
"Dynamic audio files, huge libraries, and intuitive music A.I. for selection recommendations, Spotify is definitely the go-to app for music listening."
"Its so easy to use and I use it on a daily bases . I hope it brings you as much joy as it brings me ! I would 100% recommend Spotify if you like a selection of amazing podcasts , and music. though unless you buy premium there is alot of unessisary ads and since the update it crashes quite alot."
I am using spotify for 3-4 years. Its a great app i cant compare spotify to other apps beacuse spotify have many features and beautifull and simple UI. I love the recommandation in spotify playlist. Everyone should use it once. Perfect app 5/5
"Wish lyrics showed for every song, i know they use Genius but even when the lyrics are available on their website they don't show up on the app. The shuffle button only works once too."
"Hi. I work in a big shed on my own and I find the endless playlists great to pass the day. Whatever type of music you fancy and, after you get tired of that style you can experiment. Everything is there. Aaand then you can start building your own playlists. It really is good if you use it and make it work for you. Senan"
"I ‚ô° this app! Infact I‚Äôm listening to a song right now! I really appreciate it because I‚Äôm in in Australia and I used to live in America, where they had different kinds of song apps. I am just so grateful for it! It‚Äôs extremely simple and quick with just a few clicks! Thee only thing is, in witch I completely understand, is it is a PAIN to log-in but it‚Äôs totally worth it for the music in the end. There‚Äôs A LOT of songs that go into all kinds of categories! I really recommend this. ‚ÄîS.E.F.F:-)))"
Great app with a few technical issues here and there. Overall good experience. Been using spotify for about 8 years now exclusively for all my music and they have made steady improvement to the UI. Hopefully they continue this trend.
"I hope my review will not be biased, I started with a free trial, and by the end of it upgraded to Premium, so I may have missed some annoying ads. I just thought to try something new, but it was love at first sight. Spotify understands me better than I can ever hope to understand myself. We are still getting to know each other, and it's quite a shorthand we have developed so far. I like how it looks and behaves, it's easy and pleasant to work with. Sometimes we have a bad week and I don't approve the choice made for me, but I know we will get along. And we do, always. Just a few words to contribute to those who cannot afford Premium. Dear Developers, please be kinder to them. Make ads less annoying, make visual ads but don't touch the playback (or touch it more gently and less often). You have such a great product, it's unfair the users are divided into those who enjoy and those who suffer."
It's an interesting and amazing app ‚ò∫Ô∏è and it's very easy to use you have to just login and then you can used without premium songs you can also listen the songs with add free it's quite good good app
Friendly to use. Provide good suggestions on songs/music to suit individual's preferences. Huge varieties of songs/music from all ages & for all kinds of mood.
its insane and for the people that are complayning about the non premium thing and the ads just think of how they are supposed to get money especially if the have to pay so many people... ( btw the ads happened after it was bought by microsoft..) and microsoft ruined so many other apps but yea... great
Good app. Free Spotify isnt as annoying people say it is but i ended up getting the premium version regardless. First of all its cheap and very affordable and makes it easier to use as I can now download songs to listen to offline. Im sure people can spare 3 quid to pay for premium plus you even get 1 month free to make sure if you really want it. Another great feature is when i use spotify on my pc i can use my phone as a remote to choose what i want to listen to when im busy gaming. 5 stars
"I'm currently unable to listen to anything because apparently ""no internet connection available"". I have tried all troubleshooting and have just emailed customer support. Will wait on a response and update here. Edit: a quick response by email from the Spotify team when I emailed them, and they asked me to re-install the app. And thay solved the problem. Back to 5 stars."
"Love how a simple day can be much better using Spotify. Unexplainable how it can literally know Evey song you are thinking about or want to hear, truly appreciate all hard work put in to make everything accessible at a click if a button."
"Honestly I thought paid streaming platforms were a scam since you can download songs and podcasts offline. Turns out I'm wrong! Spotify makes life easier with it's (Clean design, High quality songs and podcasts, Easy to use program, Great recommendations) and much more! Spotify is just perfect the way it is, I don't think anything could be further improved. It's just perfect! Edit: I'm using Spotify premium, The free version is a little bit annoying with the ads and skip limits."
"My go-to music app, hands down.ü§ó I get it, that their way of advertising is so that we can be part of their premium services, but damn. üòí Apart from that, its the best music/podcast streaming app there is, infact I even come across to new music everyday that I genuinely see myself enjoying. üòò In many languages too. üéâ Its best because you also get to support your friends favorite artists and creators, and keep track of what you enjoy. üíú"
"The app itself is very intuitive, but when used in the background, the music and app constantly shuts down. This is because for android, it is impossible for spotify to be the default music player. Please resolve this issue ASAP."
I loved the app but with the removal of the widget in the last upgrade. it makes it cumbersome to access quickly and rapidly to the music. very bad marketing and developers choice.
"Had some issues with podcast playback, but reached out to their customer support and they were very quick to reply and fixed the issue. Great customer support!"
One of the best music streaming platform available with very less ads shifted to this app from others due to this reason. Currently I am not able to buy premium because the plan I want requires monthly payment and my card is not supporting it will definitely go for premium once I buy a new card
"I am unable to download the app on my phone. I have tried restarting, clearing cache, every possible option but I can't download it. It's very annoying that I am facing this issue and would love a quick solution."
"Since some time I can't control my songs that are playing on Alexa from my phone, so I need to start listening music on the phone and then send it to Alexa. And if I want to change the song or playlists, I need to go back to the phone, change, and then send it to Alexa again. It's quite a mess, but the overall app is great."
"Its a great app, ui is easy to navigate and searching for specific songs is easy. But if you want to see every song a creator/artist made you have to check every albulm they have which is dumb in my opinion. On top of that one of my favorite artists got all his music removed and i have no idea why. The only way i can play his music now is to download it to my phone, i eould rather it just be on spotify with the rest of the music i listen to. Bring his music back his name's Xyperus"
"I love it, especially the podcast selection. Wish the UI gave the user more control on Android. I noticed I had to use my pc ...other than that, it is pretty dope!!"
"I love this app, I really do. But this latest update has completely messed up streaming through other devices (speaker etc) wich is how I primarily use it. Also getting 3 ads in a row is really not okay. Edit: now that the streaming issue has been fixed it is much better but there's still quite a few ads."
The only thing that sets apart from other music apps is UI . Spotify has this cool looking thing and since i am premium user the desktop app is different from normal user.
"The only program where you can listen to your favorite artists and tracks even rebuild your favorite tracks for whatever you want in playlists to your favorite albums it's a totally awesome whey to listen to your favorite tracks by downloading all fav music in one custom made library of all the timeless tunes hand picked by only you. I have more than enough tracks to create my very own rock radio station. All I can tell you is turn it on, crank it up and enjoy all this enjoyable app has to offer"
"Great range of music and selection of playlists. However for this past update (8.6.20.1063), the 'like' button is either delayed or does not respond at all, yet the other buttons are fine. Also and more annoying, pressng the menu button on the 'Now Playing' page cause the whole app to crash. All of this happens when the app is switched to Offline Mode."
Fantastic all round I love all of my recommendations it gives way better than Google play music and Apple music in my opinion I've had google play music and Apple iTunes music thing and quite honestly Spotify out dose them all like it actually gives you music that you would love depending on your interests and such thankyou Spotify
"It's a good music application overall, I can access to almost all songs and I discover new songs and genre everyday, the app also recommended nice playlist that suited my preferences. The GUI is a lot cleaner after a new update too, it's easy to scroll and very accessible. Giving 4 stars because there are a few albums that my country do not have access to so I would really love if you can make all albums accessible in all countries with spotify. Thanks."
"I'll rate it four stars because if you're not a premium user, ads will always pop in the next three or five songs which is the bad effects when you're not a premium user. But over all, it's quite good."
"I am a huge fan of this app, I enjoy everything about it even as a non-premuim user. The only thing preventing me from getting premium are the payment options. If it were available to subscribe via Credit/Airtime I and many other free users would definitely subscribe. Please consider this. Many thanks."
I love it. I get to worship and dance and experience new artists. It's also affordable and the graphics are brilliant. Still hoping the downloading feature could work a little more faster. The different genres and categories are luxury thus I have a plethora of music to choose from and even for meditation. How I would love if there were more South African artists and their music. Awesome App!
I just love how i am able to access a lot of music on just one app...but moat importantly the playlists suit everyone regardless of the genre of music they into. Nice one
"I never write reviews, and since I've has spotify premium for years I figured there wasn't much of a ppint, but GUYS, they just did a tiny update wuere you can automatically filter the genre of all of your liked songs. As someone who has many moods and over 2000 songs downloaded, this is GENUIS! Its a lifesaver, now I don't have to waste as much time skipping dozens of songs to find my mood OR put hours into building playlists from my liked songs!!! BRILLIANT, Spotify."
Spotify is one of my most favorite music streaming app ever I prefer Spotify to other music players or apps because it simple and better and easy doesn't take up too much storage or the download and offline isn't that bad pretty quick and fast to download to offline it has it glitches at moments on the playlist the downloaded green check Mark's keep uninstalling some my music very annoying at some parts... but I been with spotify since 2016 or 2017 I think 6 to 7 years now but I still love it!!
"I really like this app and I love that it's free! The only thing that I have a problem with is the volume with some advertisment are crazy high. We can listen to music at my job but we have to keep it at a reasonable volume , the higher volumes of certain ads keeps me running to the volume button all day."
"I am using it for a quite along time. It is a app for listening music. But nowadays it is creating problem of internet issue on mobile data (I have a good mobile internet connection) while on a road trip or like occasion where wifi is not available. So, I would appreciate if Spotify will solve this issue soon."
"Music always touches my soul and i am so much fond of listening to music üéµüé∂ like an addict. Spotify is the application i only use for the music excluding video streaming but I am not underestimating podcasts üòÖü§©. Really spotify gave alot of opportunities to people to share their ideas, stories, thoughts based on something better and beyond imagination. Music is love üíï, when it hits you, you really feel free and out of space. My brain storms like many ideas storming in my mind right quick."
"It's actually quite nice and easy app to enjoy music,but sometimes the add's became so much Irritating and so as the shuffle option!To cancel that we need to have premium but besides spotify is good to listen and enjoy music globally!"
Spotify is pretty good. The recommendations are on point and the music is great. The UI is user friendly.
"I just have one suggestion: work on lyrics. Some songs lack lyrics, and the competition is doing better, so take note. Also, is it just me or that the audio on this app is noticeably better than that on JioSaavn ? - at least for a free user, that is. All in all I'm quite pleased with what the company has done. Hopefully, the next update addresses lyrics."
Needs a setting for using shuffle play button or just a play button. Third party apps that start a playlist or song radio always default to shuffle play. I know how to not use shuffle play while im using spotify. But it is just annoying that other apps are stuck using the default start of shuffle play and having no option to change the default way spotify starts a playlist. Better than youtube music in every way though.
I can listen to so many variant songs... And I'm loving this ‚ù§ Thank you Spotify to make me feel different from all the ongoing conditions.. Your playlist specially designed for me.. Makes my day! Best music app everrr!
"There is no transition gap between songs. Sometimes this can help a lot to not ruin the feeling, if two songs are connected with a transition, but separated as songs."
"the part I hated in spotify is that they add songs in my playlist....like I added the -gone- and -on the ground- music in my playlist so that when I play the music will make me feel better, then out of nowhere a random songs played in my playlist? you ruined the mood and I can play nor add them in different playlist ;-; but some features are awesome as well!"
I love my Spotify. I've been building my favorites list for some time now. My daily sanity at work would be questionable without it. Spotify beats all the others that I've tried.
"I love Spotify, it is the best music app out there. However the app is problematic recently. M ine will get stuck on songs that have been played and while playing new songs will show the graphics and information for a past song. I have not found a good solution and it is very troubling."
"This is a great app for all of your music, It has a wide variety of genres and performs extremely well. But has room for improvement. Been testing out their new group session feature and I am quite pleased with the performance it does have few glitches here and there but nothing to major. 4stars"
"This is the first time I'm giving 5 stars. Spotify deserves that. It's the best music streaming application out there. I used its competitor's too. But the UI and UX of this, the way of organizing our playlists and all and the recommendations are exceptional on spotify. When you love music, you'll love spotify from the bottom of your heart. It just makes my music listening experience better and comfortable. I owe a thanks."
Probably one of my longest subscriptions as I've been a member of it for at least 8 years now. When an album is released Spotify has it the same day so I'm always up to date on my favorite artists. The interface is quite easy to use and am able there is infrequently any bugs. Plenty of content on here with podcasts as well.
Spotify is quite simply amazing If you are mad about music and love to hear singers and bands from all over the world. It's quite simple download this now I love music more than ever and it's mainly cause of spotify. The best bit by far is the preview option which let's you listen to a very short burst of the song I can spend ages going through this and finding more and more new artists to listen to and like Thank you Spotify
Great connection and streaming online for the whole family. Interface not intuitive to me at times. The weekly showcase is often very good. Thank you Spotify.
"A wonderful Musical Platform. It give a pleasant listen experience that doesn't force you to purchase a subscribe with continuous solicitations. Also, the Spotify Platform is quite user-friendly."
"I have the family premium and it works like a charm. Sometimes the app glitches a little bit but its only a minor inconvenience and fixes itself within 3 seconds. If you don't know about spotify it has all the songs you could think of and with premium your able to listen to songs offline and in good quality as well. Spotify keeps getting new updates making the user experience even better. Also their is no limit on number of songs you can download with premium, I have about 1700 songs downloaded."
Earlier I used wynk. I thought it's the best. Then I used Spotify!Man!!! This is amazing. The playlist are very genuine and beautiful. Love the app
"This app is AMAZING. When you first sign in it gives you a choice to pay or not. Im broke so i chose to just have small ads in between my songs but recently spotify had made a little ad saying that if you press a button that says WATCH NOW you will get 30 minutes of ad free music. I think thats a deal to me, plus its only one ad so if you dont want to pay you are in luck. Also it gives people the opportunity to make playlists and to make them visible or not. Follow me at I seem fine but im not"
"So, first off.. wasn't a huge Spotify fan...but, I have quickly converted! Amazing, all in one music app! All the songs, all the play lists right where and when you need them!"
"I like spotify cause its free and on ps4 with mean i can bob to hip hop,singing,rock, and etc while playing crew 2 or need for speed. But i wish that they would ad more game theme songs like need for speed the run im looking for the music with the guitar solo in it. But in topic i have no problem spotify keep up the good work"
"Excellent song recommendations every week at least better than every other music app out there, plus awesome audio quality. Been using this app since 4years now no issues, love their UI design too."
"What a dream! I was a devout ""Google Play Music"" girl but they did away with the platform & transferred us to YouTube Music, which is garbage. I finally made the switch to Spotify & within minutes was simply delighted with the amazing UI & flawless Sonos integrations. I love that I can like songs from the notification panel, adjust the volume with my volume buttons on the phone, & cast directly to Sonos without having to choose music from within the Sonos app. My audiophile heart is very happy!"
"I like the way spotify suggests a playlist that suits you, based on very few songs that you've listened to. Its like spotify knows me more, with in just few days of our interaction."
"I moved over from another music app. I love the fact that it has my favorite podcasts! Great algorithm recommending songs I might like! One issue I have is that it takes long to connect to my google cast. Has anyone else experienced this. Is it unrelated to spotify, because I've tested my old app and it connects quickly?"
"Not as good as Google Play Music, but the next best thing since GPM is being merged into the terrible YouTube Music. A lot of great features but automatically generated playlists sometimes leave a little to be desired. I could turn on MC Lars radio and get surprisingly little MC Lars. Same goes with any other station. Sharing and co-creating playlists is great though... Don't use it for podcasts. If Spotify was as serious as they claim about podcasts they would create a designated podcast app."
"Was working great, now it wont let me log in. 4/2/21 Working as it should now, I wish there was a way to increase volume more within the app. I listen while working an outdoor job with loud tools and equipment and on my phones max volume I can almost hear perfectly so a volume boost of sorts would really be great. I'm gonna try getting some ear muffs to put on over my ear buds to block out the background noise. But the app is basically perfect for me and doesn't seem to drain my battery bad"
Very to easy to use and navigate on. Got some really good music. Looks a very good and well designed app. Very pleased with it.
Awesome app just wish there was an option if you heard a song (like sound hound) that you liked but didn't know who it was or what it was that you could press a button to save it to your liked songs! 5 stars if that was possible!
"This used to be a good app, but I've had a lot of problems with it for quite a while now. It crashes constantly. I keep thinking the updates will fix it, but things have not improved. I like the playlist feature and the overall user interface. I hope the glitches get resolved soon."
I love this app. It has so many stations to choose from to the music from the podcasts. Listening to Sootify makes my work hours go by quicker.
"So I'm having this problem where when I go to my liked song to play them it only plays the demo version and not the full song (and this jusd started happening to me today) and I have a free account and this hasn't happened to me before. How do I fix it so it plays the full version? I'm also having a problem where when I search a song it doesn't give me the option to play it, when I press the play button it plays other songs from that artist and not the song I wanna play. Can you please fix it?"
Absolutely liked the easy to use interface and it's vast playlist. Lyrics feature is also quite helpful . Would like more if it has an additional feature to change the language of the song Lyrics to our choice. It would be super great and helpful. Also kindly add more songs with Lyrics. Thanks for this wonderful service.
Been using Spotify for near on a decade. It always comes up with useful thing. The only thing that isn't great is the duo playlists don't update all that often. They seem quite full of one partner or the others music rather than a mix depending on who signed into it.
"Its good and all, but the ""Watch This 30 Second Advertisement For 30 Minutes Ad-Free Listening"" feature isn't working great. I'll hit the button it says to and then get five adverts for it."
"Spotify really needs to divide music and podcast into ""tabs"". I listen to a broad variety of music and podcasts, and having them all mixed in the same page doesn't seem very intuitive."
"Quite Good App, really appreciate it but sometimes ads come and Destroy your fun but u know if u take the premium pack, u won't get these irritating ads but if u don't , it's a total party crasher. But it's okay anyway pretty nice app . I recommend this app bcz it's much better than other music apps."
"Excellent interface and huge library of songs. UI could do with some enhancements, especially the search option. Separate the podcast from the music section and add a favourites for podcast too."
"I absolutely love spotify. The way they have build their app, connectivity, host migrations and streaming capabilities. I admire their efforts making an excellent app. The most admirable feature is the similar song suggestion algorithm they have which is as good as or even better than youtube. I have found so many good artists and songs just becaus of that. I really love the app. I am closing my Apple music yearly subscription and switching to Spotify. I absolutely love the app."
Spotify is one of the best music streaming services that I have used.It is pretty easy to use and since I use the premium version the overall experience has been pretty amazing.But when using the free version it gets a lit bit annoying to use since it gives a lot of ads when trying to play a song.The app itself has been pretty easy to use the UI is pleasing to the eyes although there is some room for improvement.My experience has been pleasant with the use of Spotify app..
"Nice and simple app. I really love the design, but, some there's some music i can't play even if i have a premium membership, like some nightcores/record.. I hope you can update it so i can listen the nightcore version too. Oh and i really love how the audio is delivered it's soft to my ear :3"
"Brilliant app, with a classy, hip design and very user friendly. Love the algorithm it uses to generate personal playlists! Makes listening to music simple, fun and exciting!"
"The app is great, it just needs a repeat button, and there's too much adds, could you at least remove a small percentage of the adds? Bcs of a non premium user it annoys me when i listen to songs and boom once an add plays I'll get 3-4 adds after that add, this is why i gave 4 stars and not 5"
"Never had a problem with this, though mis-inputs are common as hitboxes for buttons on the queue are quite small which can impact the vibe at a party etc."
"Almost perfect. The UI and Algorithm is great but I need Hi-fi audio. Please make it available as soon as possible. Compared to other streaming apps, I found Spotify the most convenient when it comes to paying. There are variety of paying modes."
"I absolutely love Spotify! Known about it for years and never tried. A little research first to eliminate the pretenders, then bam!! Just what I require. Great remastered and HD source material... Tman!.."
This app is literally amazing i can find my music anywhere but thee ONLY problem is that i can skip over 20 songs on my laptop than on my phone. I dont have an iphone so i dont have mobile data. It plays 2 songs then quits on offline. 4 starts bc i want it offline
"Love spotify! I use it all the time...At home on my smart TV. In the car through aux. While doing yard work, cleaning house, taking shower, and more through Bluetooth speaker!"
"There should be quick setting to change equalizer or equalizer that can be set on specific music. Secondly there should be a way to remove suggestion or recommendation on home, because I never listen to any local music and yet the home screen are filled with them."
"Pretty awesome music streaming service, however it glitches every once in awhile, and that can be quite frustrating."
"I love Spotify because when you stop it, it does not stay on your screen, egging you to play it. Listening to songs is relaxing yet we need to stop it immediately if some pressing work comes. It should not meddle with work such that you feel like that the player is impending your work. Spotify remains when required and goes away when required. I feel that's the best part of Spotify."
"Brilliant app which lets me stream music flawlessly. However, podcasts are still not available in my country and I've to use a separate app for those. It would be nice to get my music and podcasts in a single place. Also I've noticed that during advertisement the volume goes higher than usual which is quite annoying. Hopefully these will be fixed."
"Your app is really good, but they keep adding songs to my playlists. Which I set for certain moods, at certain times and the additional songs just don't quite fit some times."
"Good app to use when u wanna find songs u forgot about from the past n to listen to newer music too, I use it to find songs I heard growing up so I can download them from mp3juices n myfreemp3, I use this app as well as downloading them from my 2 favorite websites"
"Rare streaming interruptions. Far better UI than competitors i've tried. And a growing and diversifying range of interesting podcasts, find your niche. For music it has a wide range, but there are a few more obscure tracks I haven't found. For context, am a daily listener, ~2-6 hours per day."
"Undeniably the best music streaming and downloading service for the average listener, with podcasts being built into the app being a major plus. The subscription is rather expensive, and though it is not crucial, it is important if you want to listen with no interruptions and ads."
"Never listened to so much music. I wish I had this earlier. Premium version is worth the money. Plus no ads. Got it on mobile phone, computer/tablet and TV. No casting required so perfect sound quality."
"All the tunes are in here, i get what i want the way i want it when i want it. Id like to if its possible to get back some of my past play lists? I really dont want to build up another 5000 songs and library all over againü§Ø no what i mean???"
"It's very amazing app to listen to music. I really recommend it, but it requires to buy a premium membership if you try to listen to a certain song, and I don't like its this side."
"The android user's best tool to listen to music and podcasts. While it is just as good on apple products, spotify has always been a seamless way to stream and share music across all of my devices. They are also quickly becoming one of the best platforms to listen to podcasts on for me. Overall, would reccomend."
"This is really powerfull app in music and podcasts, but its UI is bad. I hope they will work on it and design a more beautiful app than this. Youtube music and apple music are more beautifull in UI than spotify."
"I'm really enjoying Spotify... I've recently acquired the premium version but because there was a single song that I couldn't find anywhere else üòÇ But I highly recommend both the free version and the premium version. The only thing I haven't discovered is whether or not I can choose to download only one song and not the whole Playlist... tried a few times, no luck. All in all it is a great app with a wide range of music and podcasts."
"It's amazing, I'm so impressed. Every song/music is on this app, and there's many different playlists you can find to suit your type of music !"
My favourite music player with millions of high quality songs... If having premium it's 2x enjoyable... THE UI IS SUPERB THE DOWNLOADING FEATURE IS NICE AND THE PLAYLIST OPTION AND SHARING IT IS ALSO GOOD IF I WANNA RECOMMEND SONGS WHICH I LISTEN TO OTHERS
I have used this app everyday for years now. But thately songs will stop playing midway and i have to restart the song or ohyciallt hit play. Its quite annoying. Please fix this bug!
Great for me to make play lists of my favourite music. Adverts a bit of a nuisance but I use it because it doesn't cost anything so worth it.
"I absolutely love the music choices. The podcasts that are available are amazing as well. I don't pay to have no ads. They really aren't that bad. Overall, I enjoy this app quite a bit."
"Great. UI is clean, app is easy to use and there's a ton of music to discover. The app has this thing where is recommends music it thinks you'll like, I wish this recommendations refreshed more often. Or maybe some kind never ending queue with recommendations."
"The best music application ever. The UI is so good and way better than ""Apple Music"" it's so easy to swipe for que to add to liked songs and the best part a sleep timer."
"Amazing app. One thing I dislike though. There is an ad that says tap this button to watch the ad to get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening, and its annoying."
"Best music app ever. Just stop the damn ads please. You have no idea how frustrating and annoying they are, a lot of times it just ruins the mood"
"Practically the best music app, besides the usual features it has one of the best recommendation system, truly captures your playlist mood. PROS: - great design. - great user experience. - music recommendations. - full set of features with premium. - a really good API if you're a developer. CONS: - crashes on desktop macbook (tolerable though since it's not too frequent) - friends music activity can be a little glitchy. (if you're interested in friends activity)"
"The app that is full of memories with vijay uncle as I am his nephew, and many songs available with out premium also I recommend many of my friends to use Spotify very glad to have Spotify on my phone thank you Spotify team for designing a wonderful app of songs to the world."
"Spotify is the best app that I have ever used for music. It has great song variety, and it's a very rare day when there's a song I can't find. The user interface is intuitive, and, while I have not found a use for every feature, Spotify is certainly my most-used app. It's well worth five stars."
I love the quality of the music and huge library. I like also the built in lyric! The best music app for me. On premium for several years now and still love the app. Keep it up!
"This app is usually fantastic, but it's recently been very slow. I downloaded the new update and now it is working again speed-wise, but now songs will only play for a minute or so before the app quits. When I open it back up the song is back at the start. It's very frustrating and I hope it is addressed soon!"
"Spotify is undoubtedly the best music platform ever. You can find here literally evrything from all genres of music to stories, podcasts and more. Moreover you can publish your own podcast here using Anchor by Spotify. The lyrics time syncing feature is way too good. It also has a community building feature. Here's a suggestion though - Add features like 'Friend Activity' to Spotify for Android as it is in Spotify for Windows."
Have improved quite a lot. Lyrics feature is a good incorporation and Spotify should keep adding more. Still one the top bests apps. I listen it often with a Powerbeats Pro and it delivers very well
Very good. I always listen to my favourite songs when i had a fight or being depressed or having stress really cools me down(ads are genuinely annoying not criticising i know that's how it works) overall ‚ô•Ô∏èit. Recently i had faced some glitches i hope the developers can fix that hopefully
"It's an amazing app to discover new music. But some of the songs aren't there plus connecting it with the local music apps on phone is a rigorous process. Other than that, this app has quickly become my go-to song listening app."
"I know we're using a free version so It's quite obvious that we'll suffer from this advertising thing... Oke. But you play add after every 2 songs, which is quite extreme!"
"Finally spotify is available in Bangladesh and I am so glad I am able to get the best music experience of all international music artists at the tip of my hand. Tonns of playlists, intuitive sugesstions and there are music of every genre whatever someones taste might be."
"I've had premium for quite a while now and I've had zero issues with the app. Also, the end of the year stuff was pretty awesome, kudos to whomever came up with that."
Excellent music streaming app i have ever seen before.According to my user experience it has been included lot of music categories so it's amazing but it would be more good if music lyrics are included.
"So many Artist are missing ,No KSHMR. Seriously?? So many songs are not playable, but you can explore many more hidden gems. Btw UI feels very clean and smooth."
"I am in love with spotify since its arrival in india. The great feature from my opinion is lyrics in regional language. Also, minimal design/ui of the app is also attracts me when switching to others. So far i am really happy with Spotify. Only a feature that will be worth if added is offline lyrics :)."
I have premium and whenever I open the app it says confirm your email address and it doesn't send a verification when I hit the button. but overall it's a great app.
"The app works perfectly. It's easy to use , quick and efficient. It does not ruin my listening experience by flooding me with ads which is great . It also takes very little data ‚òÑ"
01/10/21 Spotify is great for playing music I want to hear. 03/06/21 My music channel has grown so much over the past few months and I bet seldom use the skip button.
"so if you dont get premium yes there are ads but you get used to them also if you get the app on a computer or iPad you have unlimited skips, i have premium free for six months as part of a Samsung deal but after the time is up i will go back to free because it is quite expensive but overall I love this app so much and it would be the first app for me to reccomend to anyone looking for a music streaming app :)"
"There appeared few glitches recently, the first the most annoying, sometime player interface doesn't work right, you change a track, but album cover isn't changing and time progress bar too. It requires restarting app for back to normal."
This is really very good and easy to use app for organizing music. The UI works seamlessly. If there is no ADD..i would rate this app as Five Star. Thanks Spotify.
"Spotify is the Henry Hoover of music streaming for good reason, and you will download it for good reason. My only gripe is that when adding songs to a new playlist, it will only show a selection of liked songs and will never reshuffle that list - so after combing through the selection they give you, you need to manually trawl through your liked songs and slowly add them via the 'three dots'. Showing the entire liked song list from the 'create playlist' page would make this process far quicker."
"I love spotify. It's very convenient and easy. I like their algorithm, it quickly gives what I'm searching for based on my previous experience. I will 100% recommend"
"Connection to Chromecast is little buggy. It often can't find my speaker with built in chromecast, and often disconnects. While other apps work fine."
"The best user experience and interface in music streaming, almost intuitive, the catalogue is amazing. Would give 5 stars but I leave 1 star out for further development and improvement to the platform. To the people at Spotify, well done, you've achieved what Alphabet couldn't despite their enormous resources."
"Absolutely great app, I love it, the only issue I have when I connect my spotify to another app, it restets my playlist, what I mean by that is it reshuffles my que and it's quite annoying other than that it's great."
"I appreciate the ease of use, variety, and how shuffle won't play music from the same artist consecutively. However, as someone who falls asleep to the app, the call to action of ""Tap here to get 30 minutes of ad-free listeming."" is especially obnoxious since: a) ads play immediately after, and b) the station begins with that in the form of something that requires no action."
Best user experience for a music app I've had so far. I like the seemless switching between songs and the availability of everything. So far no Hi-Fi option if you want lossless audio but that's not a concern for me.
"This is what a music app should be, I am a free user but It doesn't disturb you much while playing your songs, It gives 1 ad in 30 min and that also is designed so well that it doesn't disturb my peace of mind Pros: 1. Ads are really very very less than jiosaavn 2.They do not repeat the same ads continuously (they always try to change the taste) 3.Vast network of all kinds of music 4.There are no forced ads that will definitely direct you to that product's website Cons: 1. No cons for me"
"Excellent catalogue, intuitive user interface. Excellent music suggestion algorithms. Extremely welcome news concerning non lossy music as standard. Making the best better! Highly recommended!"
Have been using Spotify for a number of years now. Only failed to find a handful of of hundreds of songs that I enjoy. The ability to download and listen offline is excellent but every now and then the downloaded list disappears for unknown reasons. Mostly excellent app. Quite enjoy the end of year wrap-up that is provided too
"I Love this app! I bump spotify daily and the playlists they send are on hit. I mean there are some cuts I don't like, but I push the button and poof! Never hear it again!! Life is good!."
The Music is awesome and of high quality. Just please lower the amount of ads because they are first extremely annoying and are high in number and it ruins your reputation as a company as it makes it look like your trying to force us to buy premium which means you are just greedy for money. Please address these things so i dont think this. Thanks
"Great app! Though I wish the Premium was cheaper, it doesn't really ruin the experience, like other music streaming apps."
"Giving 4 stars because you have missed on a very simple yet important feature. To be able to export all the ""liked songs"" into a playlist which can then be shared. Do look into it. Will provide a great user experience."
honestly i think the premium version is worth it ... if you can i would reccomend getting it . otherwise also it works quite well. it has many artists and a great amount of options having many smaller artistes and having podcasts as well. also love the friends feature though would love to be able to see frnds activity form phone . Great app highly recmended
"Love it only thing I would say is if you are on the play queue and you search for music, when you play a track the play queue should not change it should just stop current music and play the song you have chosen. So you don't have to press extra buttons apart from that I love Spotify"
"Spotify is a great app to listen to music, only 4 starts because you need premium to make it even better but it's definitely worth the $10 bucks a month especially if you love muisc like myself."
"Not a fan of the latest update. Don't like that tracks are no longer played immediately when you click on them, but you now get an option of playing or queuing everytime. Not a fan. Hope they choose to not continue with this and go back to how it was before."
"It's great but I give 4 stars because Spotify have effectively monopolised the music industry , there's no other suitable alternative .. the days of downloading dragging and dropping are long gone."
I'm glad to see the service in my country as I like it. But I can't download songs and one more thing - design of the widget should be updated. It's getting boring and ordinary.
"It was going well until there was a thing where i couldn't play any of my own playlists but i could play other playlists so this might be a glitch. The only was to turn on my music was to use the side bar (normally at the bottom) to select the playlist, the playlist would be playing but the shuffle button would stay at th play button. (I am a chromebook user by the way)"
Love building up my playlists covering music from all decades! Great to be able to download and play at any time! Easy to find songs of choice too üíú
Wild range of songs are available on Spotify as others have but the spacial thing is UI/UX of the app. Fully customer friendly app. Love it.
Genuinely got the best customer support I've seen. They're attentive and reliable. The premium is also definitely worth it and even if you dont hit the premium the free version is brilliant too.
"Intuitive interface. Super easy to use. Very rarely do they not have the music I want to listen to. Also a great way to discover small, up and coming artists."
Spotify has recently been available in Bangladesh. This is a great app to use. As a music lover there is no other app I would chose over spotify. But we need premium version for having the utmost benifit. For this international transaction is required. Not everyone can provide this transaction through credit and debit cards. It would be really great if you add a local payment medium for us.
"It is very user friendly, I have used it for 5 years now and encountered only one issue which was quickly resolved. Edit: i have encountered another issue but have found a solution. Still a great app and would greatly reccomend it."
"What took you guys soo long to reach Bangladesh? Anyhow, I'm using the basic version of this app and it's quite similar to Deezer. The only reason why I'm on Spotify is because of Gorillaz and their G Mixes. Been a huge fan of this band for 20 years and there's no way I can miss any updates on the playlists they make and the new songs they add on to those playlists. Unlike Deezer, there's 1 useful feature on this app and that is, that you can easily hide the songs you don't want to listen to."
"I'd give 5star but you guys are just increasing the rate of ads. I think it won't be so far in future that you'll make us hear ads and song in between. Just reduce the rate of ads, yeah I know that for that you have premuim but yet just make less ads or else first choice for music and 5 star app."
"The UI is easy to use. I would like to suggest you an idea. In India, we have 22 scheduled languages but are not well represented in every sphere. Including the folk songs of these languages might help you pull more customers. I like folk songs but my not of my own mother language are not present so I would like them to be present."
"I've been using Spotify for well over a year now and I can say that if it ceases to exist I would probably cease to exist too ü§£ The amount of new music I have found is priceless. I don't care about the app's bugs, etc, I haven't come across any that ruin the experience for me. Love this to death!"
"It is the best ever music streaming app,I ever used.But here are some suggestions.Please try to apply it- 1.EQUILAZER is not available in lower devices. 2.Please add a chat conversation between our friends. 3.Please add more songs which are available in YouTube . 4.Please add local files I feature in mobile version of the Spotify. Please make the updates ASAP"
"Great app, quick and easy access. Only reason is the conflict if I want to listen to Spotify on another platform, it'll show up on my phone sometimes."
"I had had Spotify Premium for about 6 years now. It's great to access any music I want. However, occasionally I find some songs from artists are not listed. Otherwise, great access to music off-line and online. And brilliant for building playlists. Although I'd like to combine varios artist's full albums into one play list."
"A fantastic library of great music, podcasts, and lectures. Easy to use and very intuitive."
"Great and reliable on my Pixel but less through Google Home. Not quite sure how this is true but this app worked better when my Google Home was connected to my old iPhone than it does with my new Pixel...the app display gets ""stuck"" on the first song I play via my Pixel to the Google Home. If music is playing through the Google Home first and I open the app on my Pixel, the app crashes."
"Great podcast app. For major content creators, this is the ONLY major podcast service to join under contract. The others are very strict in their guidelines and cram way more ads onto your listeners with non-premium accounts (and the one with the orange letters in their logo spams join premium like 5 times a day!) Paired with Podbean for live streams of indie content; it covers all I need."
"Solid app experience and design. Intermittently pauses or stops playing music. I have a 5G device (Note 20 Ultra) and pretty tech savvy; cache was cleared, and along with battery power throttle work around. Re-installed app followed support threads on all remedies. I am a paying subscriber but never experienced this with free Pandora service why guys? - As I am writing this it stopped after 4+ tracks of music - please note 4 bars on 5G."
"the app is great with premnium, which is honestly a little too over priced. It has quite a few glitches. as im writing htis to pass time, i couldnt shuffle my playlist, i would tap the shuffle button, and nothing would happen, so im reinstalling it right now hoping it will fix. Great app, just lower the price on premnium."
It wont play my liked songs but it will play unliked songs. Im on the preimuim and it just doesnt make any sense. Please make it so even if its behind on updates it still plays more than 6 to 8 seconds of the songs please. Thanks
"I love this app,but I've faced the problem. When I want to open the Artist's page on my tablet there is 'Something went wrong' message with 'Try again' button on the bottom of the page and the information can't be shown even after clicking the button . It's superuncomfortable.So please fix it:))"
I've had no problems with Spotify and I've been a daily user for over 6 years now there's a lot of quite unknown and small bands and artists on there it's just a matter of searching for them.The quality is most of the time is excellent but it's very uploader dependent now I have to admit I do not listen to podcasts so this is just a review of the music.
"100 percent recommended over gaana,apple music,or any other music streaming app,nice and clean ui and easy to use..using it on mobile,tv,laptop. loving it...many people say that there are too many ads but I never felt that.hope it will be same in future as my old music streaming app gaana has changed and I didn't liked it...so I deleted it.but I liked Spotify too much and now I am a primium member and I used it 1 year before buying premium so definitely try it...."
The app is crashing everytime I open it. Its been quite long I'm using Spotify n I never faced such problems before. Except this the app has great song collection every genre every language. Just is the crashing issue would be solved it would be great.
"It is a great app but what I think would make it even better is that, you could have a button to change the your music. Like you could make the song slower or faster because slowed songs give of a different vibe to some people and others they may want to faster to get the same vibe."
"Ive been using spotify for a few years now and never once have i had a problem with it. Music choice is great, UI is great overall amazing app"
All good. UI is great. Features are great. We can have all kind of musics. But the ads are too long and frustrating
"Had a few issues with the app, but I reached out to their amazing customer service, and they fixed it quickly üòä Love spotify! I live in a rural area with limited reception, so the download option is my savior for long drives!"
"Up until now (4 years of usage), the UI can still get confusing. My sister signed up with my Spotify family and asked how to navigate and I have to tell her to watch some YouTube videos for it. Would have given a 5"
"My husband & daughter begged me for about 6 months to switch from 10 years of being on Pandora family plan to Spotify & since I had a card expire I decided to not renew it and joined Spotify. Although I LOATHE having to rebuild my music tastes after 10 years of doing it, Spotify is much better at detected my true music likes. So far so good."
Well being an audiophile i can nitpick a couple of things but those are irrelevant to a general person listening to their favorite music. This is a very well curated and managed service and has quite a respectable audio quality after the lossy compression. But if u dont get the premium its may be a pain in the a**.
"I started using the free version of this app in 2016 back when I worked as an ECE. I very quickly fell in love and have been subscribed to the paid version since. Tons of music at my finger tips, and it's even better now that Spotify is available with fit bit and the amazon alexa."
Spotify is one of the most quickest and easiest way to access all the music you could ever want the playlist and options for downloading are amazing
Few songs aren't in the library. Have been a paid member for like a year but still never got the updated UI which actually looks and feels much smoother. Edit: Unavailability of some songs was fixed. Indie artists are also available now which is great.
"A bit expensive rate for premium, but the recommendation from the autoplay radio is worth the price. There used to be an age verification failure for songs played from albums but the devs quickly fixed it."
"Spotify is brilliant, never looked back after downloading this, not only good with music you love, but also once it gets to know you, with the music or mixed albums its creates for you. I still use the free version as it suits my needs at this point, I always suggest it to everyone as it really is very good... i promise you wont be disappointed..."
Adding songs to personal play lists from what's playing instead of like button could be a simpler and more convenient option on the display screen while listening. Not a complaint. Just an idea. Enjoying the APP very much and I listen almost every day.
Perfectly crafted algorithm that suggests the best music that suits my favourite genre. Have been using it for more than a year and still inspires me...
"Absolutely amazing. Unparalleled user experience (UI/UX). The best feature is the radio, where u get similar songs after u listen to a song on search. There's also a SpotAlike feature, that I use on the browser. And oh my god it's just so wonderful. Best music player EVER!! ‚ù§‚ù§ You will especially find it endearing and fantastic with the sheer volume of international language songs that are available. I have used literally all saavn,wynk,googleplaymusic,hungama, gaana, nothing is so satisfying."
"Impressive library, slick design, reasonable sound quality...2nd day of usage, 'now playing' display got stuck, could change what was listened to but had to close and reopen to update display...really put me off paying, shame."
nice and clean UI. smooth interface to use. simplistic and convenient. everything one needs from and app thats meant to soothe you by music.
"Great music platform for sharing and listening to music, just one thing, the premium, you have to pay to listen to music offline, it would be fine to go like five quid but it's ten so yea"
"I actually wished they're was a button where if we forgot our password we could end up changing it after tries in trying all over again. Like forgot your password and stuff like that. Not how it is as well because it takes forever to load for the thing that it helps you log in but it dosen't even let me. It says the code expires in 4hrs but it had expired in a few minutes. It irritates me, I had songs I loved and now I can't even get back in. Honestly it's my fault for forgetting the password."
"Premium user here, taking 1 star off because the quality of music can be improved I think + the standard volume of music I have turned on ""equal"" loudness for all songs but still some are extra quiet and then the next song becomes extra loud lol Maybe I'll give Youtube Premium a try when I get sick of Spotify, eh? ü§£üôà"
"Two things that have been long-term issues and havent been fixed: the hide song button shouldnt be the 2nd option its absurd and it wastes so much of my time because i want to add songs to a playlist and accidentally press it, just put it anywhere else but not at the top. Second issue is a glitch incurred by moving a track from the upcoming ones into the queue, for some reason when sliding down again it's stuck on top. I still love spotify but i think this should be fixed"
Works better than youtube music: more intuitive and complete controls such as sleep timer and lockscreen controls that actually work. More limited but better audio quality library of songs and podcasts.
Would have loved to have higher quality FLAC audio files. UI is easy to use and understand and the playlists are really well made. Could do with a new UI since this one has been on for quite some time now and its showing its age...
I really like it when spotify makes a playlist suitable for my jams! Its like decades of music in one app! The reason i give only 4 is that its lacking of what i want a feature that enables to disregard a playlist after not listening to it for a long time. In all spotify app is amazing and good!
"Been on spoify going on 6 years, this the only thing I've ever been committed to buying each month, even have stocks in spotify. I love it best music app ever. Updates are fine not a super fan of the UI but still love it"
The thing I Love about Spotify is it's App Design and features like it recommends songs that user wants to listen to I Love the app it's Fantastic amazing They have Premium plans for every type of people like the monthly and weekly They also Have Partnered with Discord inc (Rich presence feature ) Spotify is just Amazing I don't ever felt switching from Spotify it's Amazing Awesome just the Best Music streaming Service
"What a very revolutionary app it easy to use ,and it packs quite a lot for every individual, download it quietly you will enjoy ,,THAT SOME GOOD MUSIC HEY....the app doesn't mislead it musics"
"Your app is good for music listening and provides a very satisfying experience while using it. But I find a problem that you are not providing your app own equilizer, the people who are using Real me, Vivo like brand phones cannot adjust their bass or treble according to their comfort.. So I hope that you will add it soon as it is possible.. All the best#spotify"
"While I enjoy the app overall I find certain aspects a PITA. Things like settings changing after updates. Download tracks not being there a week later. I'm sure there are other things going on but as the app designers know, who has the time to track all the craven moves."
"Long time listener. I like rather minimalistic design of the app, flexible payment options and... algorithms! Thanks to Spotify I've discovered so many great artist!"
"Most of the complaints I've read in the comments are by people who aren't paying for premium. Just get premium. It's like 7$ to 10$ or whatever. It solves most of the problems listed by people leaving 3 stars or less. The only major issue I've had with this app was I guess at one point during an update, it caused the app to be very laggy and it wouldnt connect/load until I'm half way to work [I work 14 minutes from home]. But after a quick Uninstall and reinstall, it's back to normal."
Nowhere can you find music to suit and match your taste and preference and Spotify is already one step ahead planning much more songs for me. Love Spotify and Spotify forever.
"Aside from being the most convenient music app in terms of ease of access - available on every platform ever - the app performance/UX is pretty bad for a paid premium app which isn't cheap. Navigating the app feels laggy/buggy. Trying to login has lots of issues; it sends a login link to the app which is ""valid for 4 hrs"", but immediately after it says ""link expired"". I can't even reset my password with the app... UPDATE: The live chat support on the web was very helpful & quick"
I feel as though spotify Is consistent with the quality in sound volume output. I also like the random and most hot songs that are mixed. Spotify also has an easy way to share and save playlist. Thank you spotify. I enjoy sound cloud just as much. They both have their quirks.
"Very convenient, very dependable, a wide select on everything . Far out awesome to use. Zero buffering ...no internet required. Like all the rest, of the weak app's out there."
Quite literally the best music app. But the adds are becoming more and more frequent each day and that is quite irritating. Please try to give the best experience to the non paying users of spotify too.
Great app. Hit my musical taste very quickly matching my play list to my likes. Commercial breaks are a small price to pay for the use.
"G'day Folks,I really enjoy Spotify & its suggested similar tunes to my likes! I buy tracks I like from iTunes and put them on my laptop,which then end up on my Classic iPod. So,I am supporting the artists! I cruise on my yacht and am out of range for 6 months of the year at a time with no phone reception,hence, my system of aquiring music on my I Pod. It also means that if I subscribed to Spotify I would not get nearly enough of the day to day usage to justify an annual subscription. Tx,D."
"I like Spotify, it's unfortunate that there are quite a few albums I like that they don't have. And I would like to delete songs and/or albums I have recently listened to."
Works great. Minor bugs but constantly updated. Only issue is it's 2021 and phones have gotten considerably bigger. Be a lot cooler if some buttons were moved around to make it easier to create playlists and add songs to favorites. Just to do general things
"Started using the ap for the 1st time a couple of weeks ago & since rarely listen to what were my favourite radio stations. The playlists, I guess were initially built around the 3 artists selected when 1st opening the ap contain some really original, cool & previously unheard of tracks. I'm a vinyl man but love the simplicity of negotiating the site using the phone."
"Great! The only thing missing is a ""Don't like"" button so I can get rid of song suggestions I'm not interested in or songs and ganres I don't want to listen to anymore."
"Amazing user experience. The app is well optimized. However, I do wish they would add higher audio quality options above 320kb/s like other Tidal or Amazon Prime Music. Overall great app!"
Please bring a GUI for large wide auto screens. I have it in vehicle and the display is not designed for such systems. Very hard to navigate and select.
"I am loving this platform of spotify..The theme , design etc,. Everything is perfect.. But only some of the songs does not have lyrics ....but overall i love spotify... We are here to support you spotify... Keep going on and bring some special changes in spotify.. Thank you...üòáüòä"
"It's great, but lacks key MP3 features. I love playlists, Bluetooth to the car, external speakers etc. I just wish it would play *my* files: music I've composed, custom home mixes, audio drama files. And yet due to this ONE glaring fault it makes things irritatingly difficult (swapping equipment, plugging in memory sticks and the like). If you would just fix *this* - and we know you can - making it so I can integrate *my* own files into my playlists, Spotify would be the perfect audio app!"
"Been my fave for years, spotify premium is an essential in my life. I love the spotify session feature BUT there are a lot of glitches. Thankfully my friends and I have the patience to work thru them usually but it is quite frustrating"
"I use spotify almost daily to listen to any music I can think of, I dont think there's been a song that I havent been able to find so far. Really good app!....... The free version is quite annoying mind with all the adverts and not being able to rewind songs or skip more than 6 songs an hour, but for free its good."
"The app content is quite good.. but there's a bug.. Whenever I try to touch the 3 dots for any song (to share), the app freezes and then only way out is to force close it. Please improve this for Android."
"So first of all the UI of spotify is just great. Smartphone, as well as the PC app have a great design and are very intuitive. I have every song I want and the music quality of Spotify is the best of all music streaming services. I listen to spotify on the highest quality with high quality headphones, because the best sound is very important to me. Spotify can provide that. If you don't want to spend money in the beginning that's fine. I think even the Basic version of Spotify is really great."
"It works good and dandy when it works, sometimes the coding gets janky. Consistant through premium. Expect reinstall every 3 months or so if you listen regularly because without the quick loading and snappy experience it's just moot trying to relax. Downloading is a good idea for playlists"
"I like a lot of things about this app, much bigger selection than I had suspected. However I do not understand why it frequently stops playing. That is very annoying to me. Is that normal? Do I have a defective phone? If it happened more often I would have to quit it. Be nice if it would work more consistently, get rid of Sirius radio."
"Very good I have fyi I have premium but I think this is excellent. You can get others but none integrates with ps4, pc, Alexa quite as good as spotify (If at all)."
"I really like the app, but there is one problem. I really like using the Recommended songs feature, because it shows me new songs! But, lately, it's been acting up; it shows 5 songs that I already have in my playlist (they're from different albums, so it's understandable), but after I hit refresh, it either just gives me two songs, or it just says there was an error. Then, I keep hitting the refresh button until it shows me something, but I only get one song I don't know, and I don't know why"
App is great and worth the trouble of buying premium. One thing I wish out of the UI is to be able to remove songs from playlists oncurrently playing page so when a song I don't like anymore is playing I don't have to go out of my way to search or scroll through the playlist to find it and remove it. Otherwise great app and great service just pay the artists more
"I am giving Spotify for Android a four-star rating, because of this one reason. I am a blind Android operating system user and the latest few versions of Spotify have not been able to show the follow button when you want to follow an artist when you're using either talkback or voice assistant for Samsung devices. can we please get this fixed for all of us blind Spotify users Apple's product works just fine. Meaning the Spotify for iOS. Again please get this fixed and I will change my rating to 5"
"Spotify is the best music ap there is. They offer such a wide range of music, you can build your own playlists and each year they make a playlist of your most listened to music just for you! I've had spotify since 2016 and its so good I pay for premium every month for even better benefits! Its totally worth it!"
I like the UI most. Similar recommendations as YouTube Music. But Spotify has more audio contents than all other Music apps. Using it since launched in India.
"Overall I enjoy the app, but some things can be improved: -> the playlist category should have an option to just show your own playlists (including the downloaded and not downloaded ones). -> there should be an additional category for the downloaded songs, that you haven't 'liked' ! This would be really useful, because often when I use the download button on an album, it doesn't automatically 'like' every song so those songs won't show up in the 'liked songs' category."
Love the quality of the music on Spotify! Only thing that bothers me at times is how much less intuitive this program is than the lesser sound quality of you-tube.
"Look, don't get me wrong. I do like Spotify, it's just that it's dumb how you need premium to listen to a certain music on mobile, but on pc, you don't need premium. If you use your phone a lot, I recommend just downloading music from MP3Juices and play them on your phone's music library."
Such a user friendly app. Also a wide variety of music with individually designed playlists. A wonderful experience!
"Before I bought Spotify premium, there were a bit too many ads! I would always get like 3 ads that you could never skip and then the 10 second ad outro. But since I got premium, the app is amazing! The only problem is, when you add new songs in new playlists from the little + button in the music folder, you add one song and you go back to the Start. It's very annoying. Overall, I definitely recommend this app!"
"So Easy to use! I broke out the old LPS, chose some favs, and built a playlist on Spotify. Saved me countless hours of poor conversions, and Spotifies suggestions helped me grow my library off my playlist!"
"I like the AI recomandation music and descovery weekly, i love it so much. Great app, great music, good optimisation and intuitive interface, thank you! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Spotify is the gold standard for online music streaming services. Top marks for hiw well it integrates across all devices. If there is one area for improvement, it would be th UI. It feels like the most commonly used features are awkward to access."
The only thing that annoys me about the app is when you dont have premiuim you get ads and i wouldnt mind this if it wasnt the same add three times in a row one after the other then it plays like 4 songs then the same ad again three times.
"Love that I can make playlists of not only music, but podcast episodes too. Love that I can save playlists to my home screen for quick launching when I hop in the car. Love the home screen widget."
"WARNING: AMAZING APP ADDICTION! The first time is free. So i downloaded spotify and became addicted very quickly the access to my favorite music is really unparralleled.After seven days the free trial expires and i personally experianced immediate panic because i had no way to upgrade to premium but it only took 45 minuts to hit the pawn shop and get a spotify 3 month card. So my warning is really make sure to be able prepaired for when your trial runs out, you are going to need premium! 5 star"
"My favorite music app. All the artists I love are here. The Playlist building capabilities are great and with the family plan, everyone in our hose can have their own account for a low monthly fee. Plus it works well with Android Auto in my car."
Fantastic !! I have access to all my favorite podcasts. Also I use it almost all day at work in a steel building and have never had a single cutout or buffering issues
Best music app I have ever used. Good quality music and I think it will not disappoint any of it's user. Love using this app. But please reduce the frequency of adds. Nice and simple ui.
Quick and easy access to music. Not the depth of a home sound system but satisfactory whilst on the go.
"Great, but the radio stations seem hit or miss. Also the search for podcasts is not intuitive."
"Spotify is the Best app ever! I use this app alot and Ive never had any issues with it. I've created several playlists, and Spotify has created several playlists, designed especially for me, with hundreds of songs that I ‚ô•Ô∏è, all for free! Thank you Spotify! I recommend you check it out, You cant go wrong with this app!"
"Music moves me, spotify aids me greatly in finding just the song I need to hear when i want to hear it. Pretty slick and intuitive interface, vurr nice"
"The app is really intuitive, the music selection is unparalleled. The Premium subscription is very worth it. The best app to get your music."
"Been a user for years and have one request. If I want to stop listening on a device please put a ""Disconnect from Device"" option instead of a ""Forget Device"" option that is large and requires no secondary ""are you sure?"" Prompt. Thank you"
"Only major gripe is that in the free version, when there is the ""watch an ad to get 30 minutes of ad-free listening"" there is 10 unskippable seconds of ""enjoy your ad-free experience talk."" I bet if that was replaced with an equal amount of ad time, you'd get more money without sacrificing any user experience. They wouldn't get any more ad time, yet you'd get more ad time! Missed opportunity"
"This is a good app with good texture smooth and quiet interesting, but adds omg what can I say about them, soo many adds I am just fed up with it, but I can't use any other app instead of this becuase of its too good texture. They randomly play adds in which they promote themselves only by recommending us to buy premium version of this app, like come on just decrease the quantity of these adds. Rest everything is fine."
Best music app available. Fantastic artists and the UI is super easy and efficient to navigate! 5 stars well deserved keep making it better üëç
"I love the minimalistic design of this app. And also I love how this app makes me a good playlist everydayüíñ Edit: I know that ads is a normal thing, but I think its a bit too much now."
"All the music you could want and more in one place. The ads are however quite intrusive, obnoxious and repetetive."
"The app is great, sound quality is awesome and the experience is quite lean. One thing I don't understand is why can't I access the songs in my playlist offline. I have downloaded them over and over, but they keep getting erased. I don't understand how that works."
"It is the beste music streaming service! Although it's not always as fast and the UI on mobile devices could be a bit better, the UI on desktop devices is amazing! Managing your library is easy and I like that you can add your own picture for your playlists. The music library of Spotify itself is also very large compared with others!"
This app never let's you down with all it's new music and always trying to give you the best experience whether its checking up on you to see if you are enjoying the app or finding better deals for you or even upgrading you package to suit you. Spotify always has new music specifically designed for you taste in music and your favourite genre!!
"I only have the free version. I'm not the most technologically gifted person. You can only skip 6 songs in an hour so if your trying to build up a library by skipping songs you've already like, you're screwed. The commercials seem to go on forever as well."
Amazing selection of great music and great categories. Intuitive and easy to use. Excellent App!!
"It's a very good app, the only thing I don't like is the ads, often I will hit the watch an ad for 30 minutes ofnad free music button and I will have to watch like 3 ads, not 1."
Such a huge collection of songs we can find for every kind of mood and situations. And great plans which convinient for all types of requirements. Great experience. üòÄüëçü§òüòÑ
Great collection of songs. Intuitive user interface and excellent sound quality.. absolutely the best music app out there!!
Very good except you have to pay money to listen to free music but the catch is you have to download songs to listen without wifi which is annoying because Apple music just let's you buy the song and you have it forever no downloading required
Spotify is simply the best!! Love their intuitive and personal customised playlists that seem to perfectly capture your taste in music and cater to your mood. I've been introduced to so many incredible musicians and artists and enjoyed music I had never heard of before. Thank you for bring music to my soul Spotify!! .. You make my day and will always have a special 'spot' in my heart ‚ô• üé∂
Not a premium member so if I want to listen to music while out and about then it eats up mobile data which is annoying adds come up quite a bit which is annoying as well but other than that the app is solid to use
"Love it ,you can design your own Playlist. And they will suggest/make you a weekly Playlist based on things you've listened to. And being able to listen while scrolling facebook or kohls/walmarts app is pretty cool !!"
Great app for people who love listening to music however the equalizer is a little complicated as i have an up to date smart phone. I enjoy this app a lot and could have an easier equalizer and could possibly have a built in shazam. Other than that this app is great for people who are passionate about what they listen to. I would also recomend this to artists want to be artists.
Very good app to listen to songs. The songs load up very quickly and run without buffering. One of the best apps out there.
"I use it all the time. And share the account on my PC as well. The song recommendations are quite good, and I love the pre made daily mix."
"It's a really good app... but you have got to chill on the Ads! I mean, I understand that you need the support or whatever but it's a little too much. Just saying, you people probably don't understand how annoying it is, to start hearing that one song you know, getting the vibe and then you loose all of your motivation cause of these ads. Believe me it is really really annoying. Hope you will fix this quickly! Don't take it to personal, it's just a word of advice!"
"Great sound Quality and vast range of songs. The support is very useful and quick to respond. Easy to use because the layout is simple and effective. Use on or offline. Many relaxing songs, podcasts, disco, etc."
Best app ever just it have few problems like the ads come like 2 in a row and it reminds you to make it premuim or u will get ads in every 4 songs and the other thing is takes more space in pc and it also automatically logs u out whenever you dont use it for 1 and a half week üòÖ so thats all problems are üòÄüòÅüòÄ
...Spot on Spotify. ...I have not felt such music-love since the days of mixed tapes or ..more recently creating compilation cd's on my iMac while studying Graphic Design in 2000. I feel connected to the music world and the people I love & share Spotify with get the same feeling of control & ease.. I won't lose my mind if I have my fave tunes at hand. App Happy! Tune-escenct! Thankyou Spotifyland üëå
Very intuitive and user friendly. Also a truly vast and varied selection of music and podcasts etc. Highly recommended
"Just awesome. It is suitable for Indian who is in the yearning of listening korean music, BTS and Indian music on a single platform while writing, working and multitasking. It's podcasts are worth listening. Better than other music platforms."
Love the app but recently it stops playing fter every 3-4 songs. And I have to restart the app to play again. I can't control the play button with my widget anymore.
"I listen to music every day with spotify, the streaming quility is great and the app is very easy to learn, spotify always suggests great songs to add to my playlists, absolutely worth the monthly subscription üëç"
There is nothing better for music than spotify. You can find anything on the planet on it and it is a great app to use so easy and so quick and so simple. This is been my favorite music app for the all of existence
"Best app for music lovers ...i have tried many apps but i liked it most..very smooth , easy to use and feature loaded ... all songs are available in spotify. But those who are not music lover ..i recommend them not to download spotify ..because it is just made for music lovers ...i am a guitarist and i have tried many apps for music but i didn't found any app usefull but ..using spotify is a different and amazing experience for me .....hope this will help you"
"The best music app I have ever gotü§© But I don't have premium in my account so it provides many ads which are just irritating. But no worries, others features are quite goodüòÉ!! Thank you Spotify for making each day of mineüíöüñ§"
Used spotify the most of all the choices .layout works for me. And the gui fits me. Hoe the buttons for functions just are in the right place for no extra effort or errors when working out
RADIO RESHUFFLE FEATURE ~SUGGESTION~ I find my radio algorithm is too strict and I get the same songs a lot over different radios. I think a small algorithm reshuffle option/button for each radio would be an awesome addition.
"I try almost all available music app like Apple music, wynx, gaana, jio music, savan, amazon music but I was not able to stick to anyone for long time and there was multiple reason like songs vairety, quality, auto Playlist, UI experience for one or other I was not use the app properly. For Spotify I was reluctant to use at first as I thought it won't be having good variety of hindi songs but to surprise it was really good. One best feature what I like the Playlist suggestion. Really happy."
"Been running into quite a few songs that I can't get, but still very pleased with selection. I don't know if its glitched out, but I seem to be stuck somewhere between regular and premium spotify. Re-insall fixed it"
"Great music and (recently discovered) Podcast service@!! With or without Premium, I get great and frequent use from this app. It does often require a restart however I still have no complaints!"
"I love this app. I have had it since 2017 and it has treated me well. But its called a ""LIKED SONGS"" Playlist. If I didn't click the little heart button, dont play that song on that playlist."
"Great music app, good choice of music and good that it has car play in settings making the play, pause, and buttons bigger when u are in your car, it seemed to dissappear for a while on the app but I have it back now which is great. Overall a brilliant app, just maybe wish u could maybe change the style and layout of your playlists more, I. E. Bigger and choices of different layout how they look etc. Something maybe for the developers to think about. But totally love this music app. üëç"
"I truly LOVE my Spotify premium account. I have no problem affording the expense to have MY music all the time offline. My only suggestion would be to add more volume control, I like my music loud. When I use Spotify in comparison to YouTube it's noticeably quieter. Otherwise I have no issues with the app!"
I have found this music app the best than any other apps... UI is so user friendly and music quality is really so awesome... You can add this app in your phone to get the melodious taste of music...
"Probably One of the Best Music Streaming Services I have ever used. It's been the daily driver for each and every person that i recommended it to. One the Many Nice things about this is That the pre-built playlists are GOOD. You will actually want to listen to them. And also the dark theme. I am just kind of obsessed with it. Also, the playlists made to help in focus and to study is also very good and has lately helped me build my productivity. Overall, you know that there is no compromises."
I have updated my review. Since a month ago I can see an improvement from the App and I dont face more issues. So quite happy with the new app updates. Old review October 2020 I have a lot of issues with the App. I cannot even log in. Everytime I request for a new password it sends me a link which it is already old. So I can not reset it. It says also is offline. I can not enjoy it since few weeks ago. Dont know how to solve it.
Pros 1. Best UI. 2. Lots of content. 3. Best algorithm ( sort of like a mind reader ). Cons 1. Nothing. Note : Go with premium. Ads will really gets on your nerves. üôÇ
"I use spotify all the time. I'm in love with the karaoke option. I used to play songs and quickly search the lyrics in internet, but now the lyrics are always there. The app never crash or something like that. And the pc version is good and looks aesthetic."
Solid platform. Better than Soundcloud when it comes to actual music that people want to listen. The ads are not a nuisance at all for me. Well done!
"Brilliant app, so quick,easy, simple to use and sooooo many songs, artists, album's and information to help you find the relevant artists/songs."
"Great for audio, but i have visual issues. Moving from iOS, Android gets more features but less UI Polish. Liking a song doesnt update on my G8X, and lots of little thingd make listening great but interacting off."
I love it! It's easy to use and find new and old favorites. The premade playlists also featured are very nice. I recommend upgrading to the premium as the unlimited skips and back button are locked with the free version.
We upgraded to the family plan and have fallen in love with spotify all over again. We all can share our playlists or keep it seperate. Endless hours of music and it doesnt kill my phone as quickly at youtube.
"I like this app very much because there a lot of songs here (including some Cdrama and Kdrama songs) but the problem is that the lyrics are not in romanized form, the Chinese, Korean and Japanese,etc., songs should have the lyrics romanized. Kindly get into my issue and solve it quickly üòä"
Amazing app...works well and uder friendly UI. I used to use it on my daily basis and I had a bug which was causing the app to close automatically.. Thanks to the Spotify Team for helping me in over coming the issue. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Great App with Great Developer Support‚ù§Ô∏è Spotify Deserves 5 Star rating!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
"I hate doing playlists. I love random and did not find a way to shuffle a whole artist, only songs inside an album. However, daily mixes and other proposed stuff, based on what I usually listen to, work great. I would give Spotify zero stars for not having Accent - FluierƒÉturi in bisericƒÉ, but I am minding my suffering... somehow. Music should surprise you, not serve you like chocolate after being dumped by a lover. Also music is math only the soul can solve, but it is math. It is therefore holy"
i really love this app i've been a loyal customer but can you please move the shuffle & repeat buttons back to where they were on the front omg.. they're so hidden in that corner ~more options~ button i really thought somehow i'm not premium anymore. these buttons are more important than the like and ~get rid~ buttons. also will you please let us upload cover images via app not just via pc?
I give Spotify 4 stars only because it gives you quite a lot of ads but not some much that you get really angry. Also if you want to listen to one song in general you have to get premium then you can do that or you have to make a whole playlist with different songs too. You can also think of this as a positive or a negitive as Spotify tends to switch you onto a totally different playlist. I like this as I can find different songs that I never knew of. But overall Spotify is a great app.
"for the past few days my music hasn't been playing, I've deleted the app and got it again and I've restarted my phone and checked wifi and all that but it just won't play even when I click the play button or if I choose a different song"
"My go-to song app. Easy to use and good UI. Two negatives: No modern looking widget yet, current looks outdated. Sometimes the ""Now playing"" screen is not shown for the user but clicking the screen acts like it is the current view; its a bug."
"Simply the best, no other option than rating 5 star but reduced 1 star for too much annoying ads, initially there were 1 or 2 but now there are at least 3 half minute ads which totally ruins the mood otherwise its the best"
awesome music app. it would be spectacular if Spotify links with poweramp music player. An option though apart from the device built in player.
"Excellent , no words can be used to describe the app , only one thing, please don't change the minimalistic black UI, I might be biased, & am a Spotify fanboy..."
"Have been using this app for years. I've had premium for quite awhile as well. I truly love Spotify. Other than the constant UI changes üòÇ this app is great. 4-stars because they just allowed ads within podcasts even though I have premium. Really, really disliked that."
Quite amazing. They always suggest good songs based on your previous listening. They wrap your year or summer in a playlist. I love it. Totally recommend it.
"Want to be on the cutting edge of the newest music trends like you used to? I was decades behind, bored and can't really stand most big label ""produced"" top 40 radio drivel. Loving music once again and hearing the good stuff first. Quick learner, knows what your into. Has turned me on to SO much brand spanking new stuff. Turns out my tastes have changed as well, who knew? THE BEST NEW MUSIC APP SO FAR."
"A great range of music styles and genres. I always find something to suit my mood and ""daily mixes"" with recommendations from your listening experiences it's hard not to enjoy Spotify!"
"Best user experience. Looking to see the music collection library grow, so that search feature is more smart and accurate."
"This app has been my favourite music player for a long time! And I still love it till now. The reason why I gave it a 4 out of 5 though is because sometimes when I play a song and pause it, it'll still continue to play the song even when the play button shows that it's paused. It'll also continue playing it even when I left the app. I don't think its because of my device since I've used it with other devices and the same problem happens, its not often though. This causes me to panic everytime."
"Spotify is my main music app and I use it quite frequently. I dislike when an add comes on saying ""click to watch an add and receive 30 minutes of add free music"" and I click to watch the add and it goes away so I have to keep listening to adds every other song."
Love it especially the UI and recommendations since it has a better algorithm than its other competitors and believe me I have tried it all only one other streaming comes close YT music but it doesn't have Spotify original podcasts.
"Would be 5 but over heated & crashed my phone a few times , working on PC & Android , tiny button to chose speakers / Bluetooth / cast-audio is very effective if you haven't found it your missing out ."
The best! But... why the GIANT 'Shuffle Play' button on the playlist screen? How about a smaller 'Shuffle' button and an adjacent 'Play button' so you can play upon opening a playlist without scrolling down?
"love it. however, it's not a rare occasion that the app just forgets what i downloaded, i like to have playlists and artists' songs downloaded and it's really annoying to have to tap the download button on all of them every month or so."
"Amazing !! I came across every music platform but nothing impressed me that much as spotify did. The clean, vibrant and minimal UI, auto generated playlists and genre classifications made me never quit the app. I was a free user and the ads were disturbing me diverting my attention to a playlist but now I'm a premium member and can easily play anything I want and download songs and podcasts."
Spotify: watch this add for free add free music! Me: okay that would be cool. *Clicks watch button* Spotify: plays add and promptly plays 3 more. Me: hmmm that's not add free. Spotify: (not long later) plays 3 more adds. Me: ugh liers lol
"Best cross platform app yet. What i like most is I go anywhere, my songs are available, PC, mobile, TV. Only thing I miss about it is Play Next button."
It's great until you hit ads. Decent app for music. I had expected that this popular app would be definitely equipped with sleep timer. Pls add sleep timer.
I love Spotify! No other music stream lets you play what you want when yoy want -- no matter how obscure. For example a recent Louis Vitton commercial sampled a slow version of a disco song I loved as a teen. But since radio never played I totally forgot. After a few google searches rediscovered Idris Muhammed's Could Heaven Ever Be Like This! Incredible! Thank you Spotify. It's now included in my Disco and Dance playlist.
"Everything is fine, I just don't like how it adds suggested songs to my playlist. If I had a button for turning it off that would be great."
"Well, I thought Spotify is the best, but it's not. I thought so because of all that hype around it. Yes, it has a large database of high-quality music, but so Youtube Music does. The app has a cool UI and UX but music and covers loads too slowly and sometimes there are wrong covers. In comparison to Spotify app, YT Music loads music and covers really fast and there are never wrong covers. Both Spotify and YT Music have Premium plans for students but it's harder to get one in Spotify."
one of the best app for music. One disadvantage is need to increase or decrease volume pressing the button in phone. add feature for volume adjustments in touchscreens using Spotify
App is designed beautifully. Content is good. Playlists are awesome. Sound quality is awesome. Only content of old Bollywood songs is less. So need improvement for this topic. Overall nice experience.
"Old update is 5 stars. New update is 2 stars. Navigation in app is extremely hard and the UI is extremely slow, takes 3 seconds to load a song off the albums. Please revert back to old Spotify!!"
"I would rate it 5 stars. But there's so many ads. Luckily they let you listen ad free if you watch a few ads, but sometimes I click on the button and it still gives me ads after I LITERALLY CLICKED ON THE BUTTON. PLEASE FIX üòêüòê"
Best music streaming platform out here. Non of these lil girlies are doing it like Spotify. The playlists? Immaculate. The end of year Wrapped? *chef's kiss*. The song and artist recommendations that perfectly suit your taste? Exemplary. The podcasts??? TRAILBLAZING. Name a b*tch badder than Spotify. That's right YOU CAN'T!!! Tell apple music and all them lil kids to pack it up! Quickly.
"First of all the UI is great, but some features like showing songs in the queue before the current song and also a feature to add a song right next to the current song with the queue staying intact by going down one step. Overall the application is great. Please look if the above mentioned features could be added. It would be great!"
Great app! Great choices and the app is quickly learning my preferences. Just switched to premium - so nice with no adds and a few more features.
It's the most appropriate music app for music lovers. The playlists are better than other apps and the recommendations are quite good. The most interesting feature of this app is the Wrapped feature. Here you can discover your yearly music activities and it's fun.
"Better than Pandora!!!! Only thing i cant stand is your greed for advertising. I loyaly paid for premium for years and the moment i dont you slam a person with advertisment after advertisement and waste my time with pressing a button for a lousey 30 minutes of music. Get rid of the ""Watch Now"" button cause your going to make me listen to your advertising anyway. Time is the most valuble thing on Earth so quit wasting mine. Wheres your loyalty?"
"Our family just switched from YouTube music. This entire experience is so much better plus we can stream direct to our sonos now. Spotify is also way more intuitive with lists and suggestions! We transfered all of our Playlist for free with less than 1% inaccuracies, which are easy to remedy after the fact."
"They need to fix their Ui. Saving / Removing a song to your list is too near to the play button. Shuffling is a huge mess. When you do it songs that you previously listened to is on repeat. Feels like my thousand plus song library is only hundred less. Also the app freezes a lot. Sheesh. I do still give it a 5/5 but come on guys. I like your service, but can you atleast listen to people who pays for premium?"
"Thanks for great app! Using premium every day for last years! Greatest feature is the weekly songs suggestions! Only improvements I would like to see is the separation of music section from podcasts (podcasts deserve their own section, so it doesn't ruin the music experience and also improves the latter, and an improved podcast discovery/searching UX), and removing some playlist suggestions/past played playlists (eg. country based suggestions, which are very irrelevant for me most of times)."
"Excellent music streaming/downloading (if you're a premium subscriber) app. There is a slight learning curve with the UI, but it's not the be all end all. I switched to Spotify after GPM shut down earlier this month and I'm very happy so far with the service. The only downside I've encountered to date is, due to the fact that I live in Quebec, Canada, I'm unable to take advantage of the 3 months free promotion. This is not the fault of Spotify, it's because of the provincial laws."
"Great app, love the variety and the recommendations, extremely intuitive and easy to use. Also love the suggested new artists and Daily Mixes and Release Radar!"
"This is a very good music app. I would have gave it 5 stars but I dont like the whole 6 skips an hour. If you guys at spotify could maybe turn that 6 into a 12 or give us non-premuim users a unlimited skip count or maybe add it in so we can watch ads to refill our skips, that would be awesome. But great app OVERALL."
I should have been using Spotify all these years instead of Google Music. Great work! Intuitive Huge song selection The forward cache isn't bad either. Dolby options This positive list goes on.....
"It's an amazing app! Sometimes it glitches out, but that's fine. And something funny that happens is; when I'm watching stuff on crunchyroll, and i press the play button on my earbuds, it plays spotify. Even if spotify isn't open, but I'm fine with it happening lol"
Love it! Has access to every artist I could think of and has actually introduces me to artists that joined the ranks as some of my favorites. It's very intuitive and I've never had a problem with the interface. I spend at least a few hours a day listening to it and am not ashamed to admit I'd be completely lost without it :)
This is one of the best apps on my phone. But I wish their is offlin music too.i think a download button for every song could help. Please accept my request and apply download button for every song.. thanks!
"There's this new thing, where Spotify suddenly stops playing in the background until I unlock the phone. And I refuse to give it permission to constantly use as much battery as it sees fit, if such a thing would be a solution, since that hasn't been necessary ever before. There seems to be a pattern of insanely poorly designed functions in this app. Unfortunately, I have been using it for so long, I won't bother having to change to another service. Jokes on me, I guess."
"Don't know why, but i hate to use online music app before I use spotify . means i have no word to express how much I love this app . UI of the Spotify is very attractive and i like it so so much . Overall 9.9 out of 10 ‚úîÔ∏è"
"You know what Spotify needs? A feature to look up lyrics with one button. Just redirecting to the browser and entering ""lyrics"" into google. Or even better, like shazam or soundhound fully integrated but thats only slightly better but obviously a lot more difficult and expensive to do so really not neccesary."
in my times I've almost lost all hope temper dignity and mind more than I can count in numbers thank you for this app it's saved me too many times to count for some reason since the first time I ever opened it I just loved the fact I could pick the genre based off my mood. lifesaver to the fullest thank you genuinely seriously and for real thank you from a person disassociated from even myself. This is/was/will be my own saving grace.
"I really liked the way, the designers have designed the app. Playing songs on this app was really a great feeling. I have used other apps for listening to songs which includes Gaana, Hungama Music, Airtel Wynk. Still I would say that this the best music listening app I have seen so far. Thank you makerss. The only thing I want improved is that you must add a section where I could play the songs which are in the phone memory, even if I am offline. Else, I loved it."
Hands down the best music streaming service. 10/10 both in Quantity and Quality. No other streaming services match Spotify in terms of audio quality and library. Literally no competition for Spotify! Sleek and modern UI; Music discovery is pretty much tailored to my tastes now; absolutely love it! ‚ù§ The student plans and prepaid plans are a bonus. Also love that there's Paytm as a payment option. üëçüèº
"I am rating this as premium because that's how it's meant to be used, if you get the free version don't be surprised if it's not that great, but the family plan for premium is very cheap and as a music app is completely perfect, works well and very intuitive with all the features id want"
"Brilliant app, I've made different play lists to suit what I want to listen to, I've even made a mixed Christmas list mix with normal music and then out of all my lists I have favourites so I can play my favourites that are mixed from different styles of music. Only downside are the adds."
"I used to use a device that solely relied on hard disk space as I was always weary about streaming services. Since using Spotify I've found that whilst I can build as many playlists as I like, I can also discover new music. I'd still be listening to the same things if it wasn't for Spotify so thank you!"
It's a really awesome app and has amazing playlists for any kind of music. Would totally recommend it. Although it does have ads but they too have some good beats. Most of the time they put 3 ads and then let you stream music for quite a while üòÇ
"We need the 'friends activity' on the phone version of the app. Other then that, love the app but it's quite buggy sometimes and the design could be improved."
"Was good originally. Last few months have been awful with glitches. Not playing songs no matter what you do, skipping songs randomly without hitting buttons. Sometimes when you want to change songs it won't. Samsung s9."
"It is an awesome app. Provides best recommendations and music updates that suits your peesonality. However, the only problem is the advertisements that are repeatedly broadcasted."
"Its great and all but when it randomly plays a song out of the playlist which they call ""suggested song"". It ruins the mood. Also, a joke, the ads will pop up after listening to a song when the free trial ran out making the vibe interrupted. And then, the ad will talk about interruptions...like Wth ._."
"Widget removed. Why? To change song, review playlist is one click too many. Edit: widget back!!! Quite often player stops playing songs even in offline mode when I have them on my device"
I have found in Spotify every artist I like and the daily mixes created by Spotify are an excellent way to have a quick selection of my favorite music. Very intuitive user interface.
"Great app! I like to discover new music with it, but I find it can be hard to find new artists outside of your algorithm. I would also enjoy if you guys could develop the group sessions a bit more. It's a great concept, I truly like it, but there's quite a lot of bugs. Thank you for this app tho üé∂"
"Great app, really good design, and I listen to songs everyday. I wish that some premium features were free. There is a really cool free feature where you get lyrics and background information on the artist and song."
"Spotify is one of the best music app, i like their community! each year, they wrapped a story-based like of what you're listening, its like your statistics based on what you're listening, they showed you what you've done so far, and it suprises me! not every app has a genius 'thing' like that. Spotify is so easy to use, but if you're accidentally unchecked the download button, it will reset all downloaded song and you must re-download it and it negatively impat the app's, overall its amazing"
"This is the best you can get from a Music streaming application. With thousands of podcasts and latest music albums [along with retro classics ;)]. The UX/UI is so neat and easy to comprehend! On top of it the features, premium provides you with, totally worth itüíô Would recommend this application over other streaming applications like Amazon Music, Google Music, YT music and Apple Music (Not a user but got feedback from my friends) üíô"
"The most used and most vital app on my phone. A brilliant user experience, an incredible array of music choices and couldn't live without it!!"
Best music app I've ever had(and I've had plenty). The many Playlist have helped me discover so many new artist and UI is super clean. Highly recommend.
"Like button sometimes doesn't work, I don't know if it reflects to my Likes when it does not do the animation on tap or not. Kindly fix that."
"This is literally the best audio streaming platform available here in India. My only concern is the ads, sometimes there are 5 back to back ads which becomes annoying, 1 to 2 ad is ok but 5 is a bit too much. Other than that, this is hand's down one of my favourite apps of all time. Kudos to the developers for creating such a refined and polished experience. P.S. - The frequency of ads have increased like crazy, ruins the whole experience."
"Superb - genuinely impressive system across multiple platforms, all the music I love whenever I want it, and a bargain for the family plan... can't recommend it enough"
BEST UI. Its really easy to explore new songs! Would be great if I could swipe a song to add it to the queue.
I was a long time sound cloud user and i still use it for some remixes i found on yt. But the sound quality has always been better on spotify. And the ui overall is so convenient.
"The app got worse. The notification bar no longer updates as songs change. I have to go back to the app to actually see which song is playing. Along with loop and shuffle buttons being locked behind Premium, this app is not going in the right direction."
"App is cool and awesome but now it has a sort of problem. Lyrics are not coming properly,when line is sung after some time that line's lyrics are comin and it is becoming quite irritating. Please look at this problem.Please look that if song is not in English or it is in other language like Korean or Japanese,it should have proper romanised lyrics including original lyrics. Other things are awesome in app. I Love it‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
U can turn off the songs u might like it's just a lengthy process u have to press the hide button heaps and after a while they will go away the only thing i dont like is the fact u now have to watch ads overall Spotify is a great app and I recommend it to anyone who wants to stream music on the go
"Can you please add some features in the next update. I think there should be a reset button named home reset some where in the setting. Recent played, made for you with no daily mix and for fans of with selected artist of the user should be added. Thx"
"It's absolutely amazing app just that there are many ads. And if u talk about premium not everyone can buy it and specially a teenager like can't, so all things are free just the ads are a quite problem but that's ok"
"I've been using this app for quite a while now and it's great I must say until today; it's responding quite slowly and it always say ""Spotify is trying to play..."". I've already uninstalled and reinstalled this app and tried to reboot my phone, and checked my internet connection but it seems like it's the only app in my phone with slow response. What happened? Hoping it can fixed on the next update because I really love this app and subscribed to premium. Thank you so much."
"Overall, I have spotify premium and love it but there are a few things that have taken away that final star: for instance, some songs seem to be zoned and appear on my device as unplayable. I would also really appreciate if there was a constant way to view your listening activity (artists, length of time ect.) And most of the song recommendations don't really suit me or introduce me to new artists. Apart from those things though.... one of my favourite apps"
"If you don't have the premium account, it's just too many ads. And spotify seems to increase their ads ever so often. Apart from that, it's THE BEST app to listen to music and podcasts. They also have amazing playlists to suit every occasion and mood."
"Great app to be honest, why 4 stars? Well simply because there aren't every song in the search option! Many songs I can't seem to play on the app... A part from that great app, also the design whereas it's on your smart TV, phone pc or tablet."
"Good but has a serious sort issue where new music routinely doesn't show in playlists without a lot of shuffling. Songs tend to freeze or less ck up the app when moving up or down in the playlists or adding to a queue when a playlist is running - i.e. have 39 songs in a list, attempt to queue one way down in the list, spotify crashes or the playlist does. Requires clearing cache and/or reinstall every time."
"App needs to be improved technically. At screens, there are no loaders at times and user remains stuck that something is supposed to happen and then leaves the app. Also the how syncing works and how one can link number or email or Facebook to one needs an easier UX. I ended up having two accounts."
Great app listen to music all day and night at work makes the time at work go by quickly .I like that u can make playlists to play without wifi never with music rock out with your------- out.
"Very good however I feel the ui could use some basic quality of life upgrades on both the consol and mobile apps. I'd also love if songs with ""behind the lyrics"" had a like a karaoke option with just lyrics. Simple recommends however even if they never came i love Spotify and can't see me changing anytime in the near future"
Lots of bugs as of late. Song stops playing on its own. Pause button has no effect. The song it shows is not the song that it is playing. First time having issues with spotify after several years so I'm backing it will get fixed. Update: fixed
"Spotify is the best! I got addicted to it via a friend because she showed me how you can build playlists and make them, it's fantastic‚ô°! I also realized Spotify gives you weekly mixtapes which has a ton of songs on it that will most likely will be to your taste according to what you've already added. They even have daily recommends so you're never bored and will never run out of music to listen to. Thanks Spotify! The Membership is well worth it!"
"I honestly do love Spotify. The worst thing on the mobile version is that there's no on demand playing unlike the Desktop version. I do pay for premium, but seeing one of my friends Spotify, playing a game of luck with the shuffle button to see if they can play their song in the playlist. Besides that (Which you really should fix as Spotify is Spotify weather it's on Desktop or Mobile) Spotify is better than any other paid/free music app."
So much content and user experience. Very good platform for music and podcasts. I have the premium account so I don't know how the free version is.
"Was looking to make my own Playlist using only positive upbeat Christian songs, I could not how quickly ""Spotify"" grouped a selection for me! No matter what you enjoy listening to, you have to give this app a try!"
"When is Spotify going to let us add multiple songs from one playlist to another, cause the way it is , it's not good takes to long to build a playlist."
"I absolutely love Spotify. I still use the free version, but this app has helped me find my taste in music. Before I used Spotify, I used to listen to overhyped pop songs that I didn't quite enjoy. I started finding songs that I liked more, and the recommendations that this app provides are absolutely amazing! I've been using Spotify for two years now. Music is a huge part of my life and this app has helped me discover underrated songs that I never would have found otherwise."
Awesome songs collection... Perfect.. app.. no complaints... Just one request if you guys can add a Heart or like button on Device lock screen... It will be very helpful to like the songs and save them... Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"I enjoy the seamless playing of any music I'd like to hear. I have the x2 plan very worth it. I can listen to all my Christian music I want, the selection is very big. The search engine is very intuitive and is most times spot. although some times you think you're playing three shuffle mode is a little unbiased. It will play the same songs from a genre and not switch out, this I find frustrating. All in all I have and will enjoy using this app for years to come."
"really great, enjoy learning new music and revisiting some great songs from the past. wish I could hit a button to organize my music by genre though;) thanks"
"I actually really love Spotify, I love building my own playlists and be able to listen to it wherever I go. It's easy to use and always reliable."
"Spotify, why is a 'download all' still not an option. For someone like me who has new phone and has saved quite a lot of albums it's quite unconvenient to download each album seperately. Sincerely, a Spotify User"
"I love spotify! The experience is very personal, easy to use, and efficient! Not to mention the music catalog available to users is quite inclusive. Spotify is by far my fave streaming app for jamming to my fave tunes and discovering awesome new tracks."
"Great for music, lmao, it's got a good UI. The recommendations are often to my tastes, and it's got a wide selection of the stuff I like. Overall great app for music."
I've used Spotify for over 5 years and I love so so very much! I've never had a problem with it. It's always quick and reccoemnds great music! Such a huge library.
"This is one of the best music app ever !!! The premium membership help us with add free distraction and offline download music anytime, without internet. This is suitable best for R&B and HIP HOP music. Though others category can also be available for listening . The reason for giving 4 star because it's loudness is good but not best if it's being listened through ordinary headphones.. Under settings, the streaming music is available for very high quality, though it should be upgraded further."
"It is a great app for music streaming. I am really impressed with the music collection they have developed over the period of time. However, there are still few albums/songs that I can't find it over here. But performance wise, this app is quite stable and smooth."
"Auto Playlists of local content are quite off the tangent, y'all mix amapiano, hip-hop, afropop, gqom, afro house, jazz, maskandi etc in the same auto-generated Playlist I.e. song or artist radio for South African content. There's massive room for improvement there, otherwise good job on the other stuff. Ooo, and keep the followers of playlists anonymous, that's üëå"
"Since I've downloaded Spotify, every other music app pales in comparison. Easy navigation, easy searching and saving, pleasant UI.. plus with the family account my daughter has access to all her favorite hits. Happy to spend the $15 a month for premium features."
The perfect app for music streaming. Literally. The audio quality is amazing period. And you can control the audio quality too. Love the simplistic design and layout.
"I'm gonna start with what disappoints me. The lack of social integration is so shameful just because what could obviously be. The session beta is gonna flop if you can't invite WITHIN the app. Overall however, Spotify has been quite flawless in streaming my music."
"I have been w/Spotify for a couple of years now. I love making my own playlists to suit my mood. The price is right, too. I'd be lost w/out my tunes! Music makes my blood flow."
"Every time I surf through mix, find myself with amazing songs, instrumental and regional musics. Though Adds are quite harrashing ,just make em less ... But one has to deal with it if u don't have premium..."
Love the app. It's design is asthetically pleasing to me and the radio function to find new songs is really helpful. Definitely worth the price to me.
"Almost perfect! With premium family plan, i dont have to worry about ads. The ui is intuitive and a like the personal playlists. The only suggestion is that they should have a built in equalizer. I used to have one but now i dont"
"I've been using Spotify for quite some time now, both free and premium, in laptop, smartphone and Alexa and I can say without a doubt the best music streaming app. Now the free version also works in Alexa, which is amazing. What I like best compared to other apps offering the same is the algorithm that suggests you new songs based on what you are listening to, it's the best out there. I'd just suggest to put lyrics to songs,would make it abs the perfect music app"
"This is what a music app should be!! After using several other music apps for years before the death of my fave forced me to migrate, I wish I started using Spotify sooner... Smooth UI, no random freezing/glitches, syncs properly across devices, and the easiest casting experience! On top of simply being an incredibly polished app, it has plenty of features I haven't tried yet. Best value for a premium music streaming subscription."
Would be helpful if it were more easy to play your music without having the shuffle play on . Cant quite figure out how not to have it on shuffle other than that the app is awesome üôèüî•
"The new UI (on all platforms) is the best in comparison. About the performance, well its getting better every second week (by minor updates - which might bother some people but I find it appropriate) just a little bugs here and there.. and that one star I won't be giving you because of the subscription prices which I can't really afford and also I think its not practical.. but seriously man reduce the price a little bit.. otherwise u know I like this app so much.. keep it up.."
The best music app i have ever seen. The ads are annoying but they are not often as in Gaana or Wynk. I like using Spotify . After downloading it I almost forgot that i also have an inbuilt music player which i don't use from past 1 year. The spotify is an app which should be installed on every music lovers' app beacause that person will surely love it more than any other app. I wish I could share my experience but it is not possible as I have already reached word limit . Thankyou Team Spotify..
The best thing I like about this app is that without paying also you can listen offline if once you listened online. The only thing it requires is a little internet connection to play earlier songs once listened online to play offline.
It has most of the songs I'm looking for. I really dislike the fact that it adds songs I'm not looking for. Premium is overpriced. You should be able to set a button- = ( manual add ) = = ( recommend ) = but the add for 30 minutes ain't a bad deal
"Works perfect with Google home speakers and Assistant. Intuitive interface. After several months of using Spotify, I find it much better than either Apple music or Google Music, both of which I used for several years. Spotify Works seamlessly with my Mac and Chromebook computers and with my Android phone."
"First time user and it's been easy to use, very intuitive to my choices, and I'm getting new content I might not of ever got a chance to hear. There's some adds, but not a lot and I don't find them that intrusive. Great üëç app **2 year Review**- Spotify continues to do all that it did two yeas ago plus it now tracks podcasts for me and has original content I wasn't aware of before. I've tried some other services along the way and Spotify is the only one I will pay to use. Don't screw it up."
An awesome app to use with good UI and playlists. But there are many popular songs missing in indian version. Once they put it back the ratings are 5 starsüåü
"I say 4 stars because the amount of skips you get when you're not paying just seems like not quite enough, which may be on purpose to push people to get premium. However, I am a huge fan of Spotify. I listen to it all the time for basically every occasion and activity. I use it to fall asleep, to get my dance on, cleaning, playing with my kids, helping THEM get to sleep. I've never searched for a song and not found it on here either, which is awesome. Not enough characters for my review üôÉ"
Really great app with a huge variety of music. I have a premium plan where my entire family of 6 gets premium for only $10 or $15 or something ridiculously low like that. A few days ago I got locked out of my account and couldnt change my password and the customer support team was very friendly and resolved the problem very quickly.
One of the best apps out there hands down. The most intuitive to use for streaming music. It's compatible with almost any modern device I use anywhere.
A great app. Huge selection of music and an excellent user experience. Really needs to offer lossless quality though.
I'm yet to use the paid membership but the free membership is also too good. The music suggestions are perfect for my choice and I'm really enjoying this app. The podcasts are quite good too.
"One of the best android apps I've ever used, and not just in the music category. The user interface is something all app developers can learn a thing or two from. So easy to use and incredibly intuitive."
"Overall I love this app for listening to my favourite music and podcasts. HOWEVER, I am quite disappointed that I can't use the lyrics function (I have reinstalled a few times but the mobile version still doesn't work both on my phone and ipad)."
"Very good app, useful, but for GOD'S SAKE just stop it with the ads! So many ads. I pressed a button to cancel an ad and I got 3 ads in a row."
"If you are used to ads, then using it for free might not bother you at all. Still, if you want to used it continuously like me, getting yourself a premium is a smart choice considering the price is quite reasonable."
Updating my 1 star review It's the best music streaming service I've ever had so far. My issues before were caused by faulty hardware on my old phone I guess. Only critics I've got is the download switch in playlists... There should be a modal confirming my choice when switching it off bcz it's no fun downloading 12gb of music bcz of a missclick... Didn't happen in a while tho bcz I learned to wait till the UI finishes loading. Oh and maybe turning off the stories behind lyrics. I only want lyr.
Amazing! Very intuitive. Loads of different playlists and functionalities. Sooooo worth the money! I would definitely recommend over the other music apps.
I ahve been using Spotify for quite some time nowü§©... I am thrilled with the song recommendations and customized play lists it givesüíØüíØüíØ... I'm loving it üòçüòçüòç... Just a request to Spotify team to reduce the ads littleüòã
"This app is insanely amazing this app had a few issues when I first downloaded but now it's ""AWSOME"" and ""AMAZING"" I recommend all fans of music to download this app it's just amazing even words can't tell how amazing is it if you want to download an music app then what are you waiting for just click that ""Install"" button"
"I love this app. It's compatible with almost all devices, and doesn't require paying the Premium for a great experience. I haven't found a way to get my songs to play offline, but I'm sure that there's a way. Has all types of music ready to suit any of my moods!"
"Bitchin' music service. However, Spotify is a tad light on classical music performed by the Chicago Symphony , which typically is the strongest. However, a notable exception is the Philadelphia Symphony's Pastorale; very unusual and yet utterly beguiling. Maybe not just how Beethoven might have wanted it, but who knows? And he's long gone, so tough noogies Ludwig. Enjoy spotify every day, we do. F'real."
"Dude this is the best music streaming platform. Not only because it has all the good stuff and simple UI but for me , its autoplays , it has the best choice of songs to play on autoplay."
"Hello developers! I'm enjoying the app so far. However, can you please bring back the alphabet scroller (or alphabet side bar or whateverit is you call) that allows to go from A to S or from B to F quickly. It may be a small thing but will really help in the overall experience. Also, it'll help if you reply to this. Thank you very much!"
"Absolutely addicted to it, though it contains adds but they are perfectly timed unlike other apps especially gaana. The best thing is, you can find Playlists suiting your mood."
The collection is good. UI is good. Would like to have more music from japanese and korean artists. Also I feel the sound quality is lacking compared to korean music streaming apps like bugs.
Great app and very useful when it comes to music. You can find whatever you want and it's very intuitive üòç I really appreciate it unlike youtube cause music sounds more qualitative and I don't have stupid adds.
"Great song suggestions. Suits every mood. Work, study, chill, travel, party, classics, genre-specific. Loving the experience. Spotify has become my primary music streaming app now !"
"I honestly do love this app (I'm a premium user so i do have a bias) the user interface is nice and clean and very nice to look at,all options for playlists.The spotify made playlists and discover weekly are great ways of finding new artists.The only problem is that it's missing quite a few albums and sometimes they only have the deluxe version of albums."
Well i chose a hell lot of bands in the beginning. And the app outputted quite nice playlists. Works good so far(10minutes). I know that my opinion is very important.
Was on Google play music but so far Spotify is far better. Not as intuitive as I'd hope but I'm just getting started. I definitely recommend this app.
"Spotify premium works well. However, currently I am experiencing some small bugs. Esspecially when I try to use it with spotify connect, built into my Denon receiver"
"For an app that has most music in the world, its well rounded. Sure, there are ads, but if you want them to dissappear then get premium. I get a 6 month free trial when I got my phone, and that is amazing. I can listen to what ever music I want and enjoy with out ads and I get the pick the song I want. Its cool and a fun app. Though I do wish they would stop having 4 ads per 5 songs, its quite annoying. Maybe set it to 2 or even 1 ads. But none the less, thank you spotify."
"One of the best apps out there, the sound quality and UI faar surpasses competitors. Totally worth getting the premium subscription. A must for audiophiles!"
"Pretty awesome set up, I didn't want to switch because I didn't want to have to redo my playlist all over again, but Spotify is very intuitive & easy to use."
Well quite frankly I'm using this And this really helped me out No matter what I feel there's a deep sadness and sometimes I really feel disappointed. This app just resets everything and make me forget my problems. I like it so much it's a part of my daily living and hope this app remains the same for me and the people out there who feel the same like me...üôÇüôÇüòá
"Honestly underrated.. having quick access to pretty much every song thinkable, the only thing that can make it better is lower price, but Apple is to blame for that. 9.5/10 (if they keep the UI layout as it is)"
Only if I can do other things and let the music play in the background. With music there should always be a repeat button. I'm Wes and im very amazing. If I vote and lay my opinion then its official. This is day 1 of me trying this app if I see any kinks I'll state it. Keep it good Spotify and yall can rely on me to keep this app on top of its category
"Its fantastic, love getting to hear all my music all the time in a format that lets you find whatever you need. A few bugs with the UI here and there, kind of irritating; but other than that, solid 4 stars. 5 stars if they squash the bugs."
"I mean its good yeah, I mostly use it on pc because I can replay the songs and pick what song I want... Im using it on mobile rn and the only problem I have with it is that it doesnt have the shuffle or repeat button on the screen of the song Im playing, actually my main problem is just not being able to repeat my songs, I tried updating my spotify but nothing worked. Instead of the shuffle and repeat button, all I see is a heart and the ""--"" button that can get rid if songs I dont like...."
"I decided to try Spotify when I heard that Joe Rogan was going to be exclusively on Spotify after December. Pleasantly, I discovered this Spotify is really a good app. It's easy to use, very intuitive, doesn't ask for too many permissions, and it's very user friendly. I have other apps that handles my media, but Spotify is now my primary go to. Thanks to the developers. The app does exactly what I wanted to right now, please don't cripple it with updates! Thanks."
"Its very cool, you dont have commercials and it varies in the type of muisc. Mine is mostly Rock and Spotify got me into bands. That I've never heard of. Highly Recommend it"
"Just love it! Moved from apple music, way more options for customisation and personalisation,and with time it becomes also more intuitive and comfortable."
"Good most of the time but tons of bugs when using it with my google home devices; songs will freeze, pause/play very quickly, or just the straight up wrong song would be played when using voice commands to play a song"
"Nice app with a nice, functional design. It can be hit or miss with discovering new music from artists I follow or discovering new artists similar to ones I like. Their algorithm seems to suggest the exact same stuff over and over again and doesn't seem to refresh often. Also, with there was a section for new music ONLY from the artists I follow."
It's the best app just because everyone uses it. The UX has a lot of janks lately. And the Podcasts section needs to be completely separate from the music section.
"I'm a huge fan of Spotify and have been a premium user for years now. I really, really wish I could turn off shuffle as the default playback mode. I've had too many mornings ruined by listening to what I thought was a bad album. Only to realise Spotify was playing random tracks from it. Please put in an option to change this!!"
"Best music service there is. The app design is beautiful and easy to use. The algorithm learns fast and adjusts to your tastes. I love the Discover Weekly Playlist feature. There's even a timer to stop the music if you fall asleep. It's obvious that it's made from people who ""get"" music."
"Best music platform, ever. Best thing about it, for me? Is the audio quality. I swear the EQ is like Built In to the app because when I'm listening to my music, it Always Sounds so much better!! Second best thing, would be the music. Love Love Love the 'Release Radar' and 'Discover Weekly', as well as my 'Daily Mixes'. I just love how they're all personalized JUST 4 ME!! Oh, and the $9.99 Premium membership is Totally Worth It, for more reasons than I have space to write haha. Thanks, Spotify!"
"Haven't got any major issues. Used Spotify for years now, always paid for premium and I have no complaints. Great sound, it's quite user friendly, great song recommendations.... however every now and again the app breaks and I can't access settings and I have to reinstall the app and re download everything. Other than that, it's been my favourite music streaming app."
"Contains so many ads man out of a 10 minute app use it gives me an ad of 1 minute and the audio quality is also not that good. But,i have the premium version which gives me very good audio quality with no ads and also a great user experience spotify premium is worth it, if you listen to music a lot you should buy it."
"I wish that on phone you can keep repeating the song just like on a PC. Also when the song ends i wish to hear it again but there is nl button so i can go back, but overall it's a good app."
"The experience is vet good , but only thing missing was the lyrics . We can't get every song's lyrics . And it makes quite little bit unsatisfied Please improve this and it will reach greater heights."
I had an amazing experience with spotify . I really look forward to play music on it . It also has a lot of songs which I couldn't fing on other music apps. So I am quite pleased with It . And I really reccomend it for listening to your favourite songs!!!!
"My student subscription has literally saved my life, especially as a single mother of 3! If they added optional lyrics like a few other platforms have, I'd be everyone's next, and possibly only, favorite spokeswoman for Spotify! (I would do it now without hesitationüòÇ My genuine admiration and appreciation.. It'd certainly be UNMATCHED!) I mean, really. Are you even LIVING if you don't have Spotify? I'll give you the answer to save you guys time, NO. Check your vitals and thank me later. YWüòè"
"Overall my favorite app. But there used to be shown how many songs in a playlist, I don't know why did they remove this feature. Also I wish there would be a ""skip to next episode"" button on lock screen while playing a podcast. Now I have to unlock the phone, go to the app and then skip it or push ""15 secs"" button until the episode ends. Additionally 1 hour for sleep timer is not sufficient. I sometimes switch to other apps with 2 hr sleep timer option."
"Excellent source of a very broad collection of musiic (good for me, who is 'genre fluid'). I had a few bumpy weeks with features after Android 11 launched, but Spotify fixes have things all working smoothly again. Thanks"
"Spotify is the best music streaming app ever.. The UI,recommendation all good. Some things need to improve - Proper lyrics - in group listening sessions add chat in it.. It will be cool.."
"I can't login to Spotify with Facebook in my new Samsung Galaxy F41. I think it has synced with Samsung account. @SPOTIFY TEAM, please resolve this issue for me. Please suggest me if require any action from my end. Edited: Issue resolved, thanks to Team Spotify."
"Very good experience if ur not premium its obviously going to bring adverts, only issue is sometimes you'll have no adverts for ages then suddenly you get upto 8 adverts at once which can be quiet annoying. Just spread them out guys! :D serious note though had very good use from this app always recommends new songs that I like! Old songs also, would recommend. üëå"
Been using it for years for the past couple of months i took premium because the ads where annoying sometimes but after taking premium i loved it overall iam very satisfied with the sound quality and especially the ui is very easy to use ‚ò∫Ô∏è
It's a great app for music. It has an extensive library and it's improving in Hindi and Punjabi. Amazing radio and it's shuffling is very intuitive sometimes. Pro version makes it easy to listen to songs online. A lot could be done to make it more user friendly for the driver in cars.
"Seems like the recent bugs were fixed at last. :) The one thing I would like to improve with the app, as it is now, would be a better UI for editing playlists..."
I love this app!! Jus wish it would quite telling me to tap now for 30 minutes commercial free adds...cuz it's a pain! It I could jus tap my phone that would be great ...but no I have to unlock phone .which isn't safe in car driving...love everything else tho! Great app..tons of great music....love it!
"Algorithm is perfect, so is GUI and the downloading interface. I like to see the continuous improvement that Spotify does; hope to see it become even more profitable:)"
"I love this app and use it all the time, it's easy to find songs and has great sound quality. My only problem is that sometimes the songs lag and when I switch between songs it'll stay on the first song I played and the play/pause button doesn't work at times."
"Price is not overly expensive sound quality and design is ok, too complicated to go to home page to use settings, some bugs here and there but overall it's good enough"
Spotify is and will remain the only music subscription service I pay for. They are the best. Customer service is always top notch too. Every time I have brought up and issue it was solved quickly and to my satisfaction.
"I am a premium subscriber, so the I am eligible for also highly commending the BETA group session feature. And the discover and custom playlists by Spotify are awesome .The UI is better than any other services in India. It is really good for streaming high quality songs. It provides a really good variety of podcasts too ,really recommend it,better than any other provider in India today.Good competitor of Amazon Music in terms of sound quality. :)"
"The absolute best music app in the world!! Their UI is fantastic, a very clean interface, intuitive to navigate. The widest possible range of music and podcasts one could ask for. Their premade daily mixes are really good and segregated by genre depending on your mood. Also provides great suggestions to new music based on your listening history. It is the #1 music streaming app for a reason."
"Was logged out of my account this morning due to an unauthorised email change. Customer support were fantastic and super quick to respond so that I could get access back to my account. Have always loved the app, but this experience was so easy and unstressful, so great job Spotify on your fantastic customer support."
"Love this app, I've been using it for quite some time now, And it works perfectly. They have a bunch of songs, from all the creators that I like, and find, it's honestly just a really good service!"
"I started using Spotify in 2019 and haven't stopped using it since. I especially like the minimalistic aesthetic of the UI... One thing that I'm sure a lot of people would like, is smoother animations(transitions)"
"Overall pretty good service, the music selection is wide. Although something may not work as intended, overall it works pretty well. Would be nicer if we could listen to.muisc from downloads throughtnmultiple files amd could acess local file music on public playlists throughout devices, mobile and pc alike, but iverall fits most of my needs."
"The product is excellent; brilliantly curated playlists to suit every mood and taste that I've ever had, and with a good range of music; not just the mainstream stuff. 0.1% of the time I can't find the song I'm looking for as it's not licenced here, but that is getting better. A few minor bugs here and there but nothing that can't be fixed with a hard restart."
"Really great app for streaming music, such a simplistic yet great looking UI. A lot of freedom for customisation and editing of playlists and overall easy to use. Only thing is sometimes randomly deletes downloaded songs and/or albums. Can really get in the way if your out and want to listen to some music"
Really enjoy listening to entire albums again! Have also enjoyed some of the suggested play lists based on my listening habits. I wish the format was more intuitive/easier to navigate. Found a tutorial on line that helped. Otherwise I am very happy!
"I just updated the app but I can't filter my playlists. The ""Filters"" button doesn't even react. Please fix this bug, thank you"
"Such a great app! Simple yet elegant UI and design. Good song quality even for free access. Just a few glitches and bugs from time to time. But, I also hope they'd improve the song suggestions for Daily Mixes and Weekly playlists. Overall, I highly recommend the app!"
Love the design and everything. It would also be cool tho to be able to put playlists etc into folders and change the picture of playlists as well as to be able to see what my friends are listening to atm not only in the desktop version but also in the mobile version. THANKS <3
"Only 4 because I'm new to this whole digital streaming services. Idk if I truly like this format and having to pay a monthly premium for more content when I already had a large library of my own music I purchased, like and enjoy through the years. Jury is still out. If you have a large ""paid for and acquired"" library this and other ""streaming"" service may not be for you or I. Still exploring, still on the fence!"
Sometimes have issues with the app getting UI getting stuck on a song. The audio is fine and continues like it should but the controls and the image get stuck.
"Good app. The only issue is that when I click on a certein track, it often gives me another track, made by the same artist. Its a big problem for me cuz I love electro, only electro, and the artists that I like also make songs with vocals, which I don't like,but I get them quite often instead of what I intended to happen"
"Spotify has been my go-to source og music for over a decade now. I've tried other services too, but never considered cancelling my Spotify. It's user friendly, stable, and the audio quality is quite acceptable. Thank you Spotify, for providing huge amounts of joy all these years."
"I love this app but there should be a button where you can turn of ""spotify adding songs"" because i hate when im trying to listen to happy music and then I randomly get a sad song."
Had an issue with playback that required a bunch of back and forth with support. Ended up having to restore defaults on my device. Support was very quick to reply and help me get the music back in my life and I'm greatly appreciative.
Very good app. You can listen music freely anywhere. Also does not require a lot of internet. You can also use another app while listening to music. I really love this appüòóüòÄüòÅüòÅ
"This app is an absolute banger ngl . Jus the issue that I'm been facing since last month is the ""SETTING"" button has been disappeared from the home page . I'm really not able to find the SETTING button as well as my profile option üëÄ. Please look on it ‚úåüèø"
1. UI and UX are great .. but don't have my fav. music.. so it sucks for me even with premium 2. With added artists increased my stars from 2 to 4 3. Rated four because you cant keep tracks downloaded for more than a day with internet on
"The app was amazing, until it logged me out and doesn't let me back in, saying that my internet has the power of a curbstomped refrigirator magnet, even if with a quick glance you could clearly see that it should be working splendiferously. However, the pros outweigh the cons."
"Version 8.5.79.1061 the ""find in liked songs"" and ""find in playlist"" buttons are too deep in the menus!! In the previous version of the app, there was a permanent search bar in my liked songs and in my playlists. Please bring this back!!! Searching is something used all the time and i dont want to menu dive to find it!!"
"I just loved the quality of Spotify. I have used JioSaavn ,Gaana ,Youtube Music and Spotify , I just loved Spotify for its Superb UI and Music Quality. But I am disappointed at a point which is , Bengali songs are very few on spotify. Please increase your Bengali Songs collection. Thats It."
"The app is stuck on one song on the now playing screen even when I change songs, and quits playing when i go out from the app. Edit: issue fixed for now, awesome! Now to wait since quite a few of my songs are greyed out and unavailable."
"I'd been using Amazon Music, but discovered the student pricing for Hulu + Spotify, so now I'm here. I recall not enjoying basic Spotify, but for me, Premium is worth it. Nice, quick sync across devices, excellent offline mode that took me through a 16-hour drive with no issues."
"Always easy to use. They take what you like and listen too and make sure to give you the best mixes and the best what you may like suggestions. I would never go back to Apple and its been a couple of years and am still here liking it more and more. Just imagine really quick, waking up in the morning to your alarm and listening to whatever the radio puts out or set it to Spotify and wake up to your favorite music gradually getting louder and a mix of made by Spotify. Best wake up. Good Morning üòÅ"
"Good app, just about every song I could ever want to listen to. Premium is so worth it! Bugs are fixed quickly."
"Excellent app. I uninstalled all other music app(s). This app has wide variety and range of collection, and for english song it shows difficult lyrics text to understand the songs, and fantastic UI interface. üëç"
"Personally, It's really great app.! Though I can't find few songs yet it's quite compatible. You can even download the podcasts with a free account."
"Works as it supposed to. It plays music. Without premium it's only able to shuffle one artist, but I have no problem with that, since competition (cough cough dezzer cough cough) adds random song when shuffling artist, whitch annoys me a lot. UI is also pretty good"
Alot of great features and I've found lots of new music through it but it is really buggy and crashes all the time. Well designed but just too buggy
"Great service, have been using for years. Just wish there was a way to download my entire music library with the touch of a button, I don't have a ton of phone storage for nothing!"
"Well, I love Spotify and use it on a daily basis. Now, first we could hit the like button on the songs which we like, but now I am not able to like a song. So I had to make a whole playlist named - Liked songs and then go to the three dots on each song and then add to playlist. And I am able to like the 'This is __________' kind of playlists but not the other ones like, 1989, Voicenotes, basically, the albums. So I had to create the whole album playlist on my own. I need help with this please."
"Got the premium version and it works just fine and as intended. Never crashed on me, I got my playlists and the recommendations are pretty spot on, too. Also use it on PS4 while playing and can switch songs with my phone or PC, so that's pretty useful. The price for premium is fair for what it has to offer. Overall I am quite happy with Spotify."
"BRING IN THE LOSSLESS QUALITY SONGS!! Tidal seriously sounds so much better. With your UI and playlists, if your sound can match Tidal, that would be a dead app. We have been waiting too long. Being it already jeez"
Spotify Is a really good App that gets you going when you hear the music. I have had Spotify for awhile now and I really enjoy It. All the playlist you can make and Its so good because you can also listen to music while offline. üëçüòÅ I would recommend this App to any age. One thing that is quiet annoying is that well yes ADDS super annoying ads. But you can just listen to playlist and then not be distracted by them. I listen to Spotify whenever I'm at school or when I have spare time. Recommend
"I would give it 5 Stars but there's no way to thumbs down or stop it giving you a song you hate again. You hide it in one discovery playlist and it appears days later in another discovery playlist. There's a like songs button, why not a dislike button to filter the rubbish like other apps have?"
"6oct20: Finally there is Landscape mode on android. Song availability and Radio has improved quite a lot since the first use but the amount of adverts is just too much but okay for a free app. Old: Spotify is okay. Nothing to dislike in Spotify in particular, but yes, JioSaavn's deeper integration with my service provider (Reliance Jio) is obviously better (JioTunes)."
"I had this problem on my Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) then upgraded to Galaxy S20 where I would click next track or seek through a song, it would be very delayed. Sometimes the animation of the album cover when attempting to play the next song would go forward, then backwards quickly, then actually play the next song. Problem didn't occur for first month after upgrading then started happening again. This bug ruins the user experience and smoothness of the app."
Overall great service but they introduce bugs every few updates. Then you gotta wait for the next one for it to be fixed for the bug to go away. Why keep changing it? Pick a bug free build and stick with that one
"[Edit: They replaced the widget] The recent updates regarding the UI and the widget removal were absolutely horrible decisions, and I am really hoping that the backlash you seem to be getting about it makes you rethink it, and return it to how it was before. The widget was something I used everyday, and having it gone is quite an inconvenience, as many others have also said."
"In the newest update there are quite a few problems, and I list them below: (device: galaxy note 9) 1. Spotify is playing music, however the bar is hidden in the notifications, so I can not pause it! 2. Spotify is playing a song, lets say it is A, however it shows that Song B is playing. And again I can not pause it! Its indeed annoying. The only way to get rid of issues mentioned above is force closing the app :| Please solve üôè"
"Its great, except for your playlist randomization. It is quite weak. For a playlist with a couple hundred songs, i think it would be great. But for all my liked songs, the randomization is lack luster. Other than that, great experience!!"
It's a great app. Clean UI and spot-on algorithms which always blow my mind with the song suggestions. Keep up the good work!
"After trying out several different streaming apps, this one is by far the easiest to use. Building playlists is smooth and the sound quality is great."
"Premium is King. There is a line drawn on the ground, an abstract boundary in the time line of Music Experience - before and after Spotify. Spotify almost knows what you feel and enhances that feeling by the right Playlist or song. Beware - it's powerful. Well done developers! You've won votes, and more importantly our hearts. The End! .. One feedback - Wish there was a feedback button for direct feedbacks."
"Using for last 1 year. No other music streaming platform can beat Spotify in terms of UI, Songs Collection, Customised Playlists, Personalised song recommendations and sound quality."
I love spotify but your latest update has really bummered up the app. When I want to play a new track it takes at least a minute before it plays. Quite annoying. Other issues include it stops playing when connected to a device using bluetooth. Also annoying.
I love Spotify. It's a great app. I can find most of the music I usually look for. Communication with Shazam is wonderful and quick. It would be great to be able to find songs by typing parts of the lyrics like YouTube does. I prefer Spotify over YouTube music and moreover Amazon music.
"*EDITED* We have been Spotify Premium users for probably 5 to 7 years now. Definitely love this app and most of its features. Would definitely recommend the premium service to people. We just wish the app had a few more features, ( here they are) 1. Recently Played Song List. 2. New Released Songs Based on your Favorite Genre. ( Brand New Songs) 3. Recommend Songs for you list. ( different from discover weekly, we love that tab but list of original songs.) 4. Play next button."
"Normally excellent, but for a few days before the last update and now following it, the track playing cannot be stopped with the play buttons at the bottom or on the notifications or on lock screen. Before the latest update the only way to stop it was to restart the phone. Now swiping up on the open apps acreen kills it."
"I love spotify, this app.... not so much. It's starting to freeze up songs and not continue playing after a sht while. This requires me to restart my phone to get ihe app to work. Spotify is a great service but the app is unresponsive at best with the new interface. Hopefully this issue can be resolved."
Spotify experience is exceptional and it has a great collection list which gets updated frequently as per hit lists. Quite comfortable to get connected with smart home systems like Alexa & easily gets connected with car.
"The song selection is incredible, it's format design is incredibly easy to understand and use, even for someone who threatens to kill their phone every 5 Seconds because I touched the side of the screen üòÖ I've had Spotify for a few years now and I've cultivated a pretty nice library and I've really enjoyed it, I've actually been using my sisters however, I definitely plan I'm getting it for myself in the future! It has been something I've appreciated, during Covid-19 especially."
"I really enjoy the app but it can be annoying at times. Lately evertime i try to listen to my liked songs it only play ""suggested songs"". I can't listen to my liked songs. And they add song to your playlists even if you have more than their limit for how little you van have. Yeah the adds can be annoying too but theu do need a way to make mony. I just think oh ts a little excesive considering the fact thatvthey make mony off of premium accounts they could have less adds. But hey its free muic."
"I enjoy using Spotify, especially since it now has inbuilt functionality with my Ultimate Ears Boom 3. I still use the free version, however the ads do have the whole family up in arms! 3 ads in a row is probably annoying enough to get most people to convert to premium!"
Awesome! Thanks for having it in India! But why cant I see live lyrics button on the songs I play? I know that if the lyrics are available then only there would be an option but I generally noticed it's not available on almost all the songs I played irrespective of the language. Any updates on this?
I dont know why others are complaining about the price. There's no such thing as free lunch. Of course Spotify wants you to pay up. The UI is extremely good especially after coming here from Amazon music which is the worst UI I've ever used. The spotify customer service is also great. My problem was resolved promptly after chatting with a representative. Overall an excellent app and I'm enjoying my premium subscription. I'm regularly listening to new music and the recommendations are great.
"Spotify caters to my specific music listening needs very well. I've tried YouTube music, Prime music, Gaana, Saavn, Wynk etc., but I didn't find any of them to be as mature or polished as Spotify. I liked Spotify connect, the ""playlist for every occasion"" idea, downloads and the overall aesthetics. The lyrics UI is super cool. I wish they allowed us to upload songs which are not in their catalogue (like some rare remixes found in YouTube). Still ‚ù§"
I love this app. I have Amazon Music too but Spotify is much quicker on my android devices. It syncs well with Alexa and by bluetooth on my Dansette record player.
"Guys, love the app. Just a bug report: when I listen to a podcast then pause it and start listening to a song the bottom playback bar still shows the podcast and player notification is not being shown. Quite inconvenient. For everything else - thanks, I appreciate your hard work."
It's all good. But it would be better if I can play all my downloaded songs from all of my different playlists and albums in one single play button. Thanks!
"I just downloaded this and it seems pretty good except i can't add songs i search for to a playlist. I tap the plus button and nothing happens, please fix this!"
"App works well. No real issues with freezes, crashes, or bugs. The user interface (for me) is like everything else spotify; a little unintuitive and overcomplicated. As a service I thinkg it's a no-brainer; a massive library, free hulo with premium and now exclusive Joe Rogan."
The queue button has been moved out of the now playing screen and is hidden in the context menu. I use the queue feature all the time so it's annoying to have it moved and hard to access. Would be keen to have it easy to access again.
The app needs a reachability redesign. The 3 dot menu which has all the options is impossible to reach with one. Picked a subscription last week. Good discovery once you find sutable playlist.
I enjoy the app but it crashes often. 4 starts for the UI and user friendliness.. would have been 5 stars if I didn't have to uninstall and reinstall to fix the crashes.
"New Premium user here. Made the exodus once Google killed GPM. While the comparison between this and the new alternative YouTube Music is no contest- I'm surprised to find that I'm enjoying this better even than my old Google Play Music. Suggested Songs to Add has been an amazing feature in rebuilding playlists, and my Daily Mixes are eerily on point."
"Very well developed application, i can listen songs and podcast at same place. interface is well build and easy to use .It slow down my system, but it's fine consider the service"
"The UI is smooth for this app is smooth and easy to use not flashy and buggy also it is not laggy, though sometimes I encounter bugs and need to restart the app to rectify it, the ads can get irritating sometimes but that is something we all have to work with, overall experience is good"
"Wonderful app I love it, literally use it everyday. Just a nuisance with the ads as well as having limited skips if you don't have premium. Besides that, would recommend."
I do like using the app very much but from past few days I'm facing a problem which I've never faced. I accidentally have hit the hide button while listening to a song and now I'm not being able to retrieve the songs back . Ive tried several ways none if which are working . It would be great if you please solve this problem. Thank you !
I think the app is great but the one thing that bothers me is the new search button. I miss how it was when your in your liked songs and you can just search instead of clicking other buttons and then search
I am glad that some of missing songs are available now after the agreement with WMG but still some songs are still missing compare to Spotify which is available in USA I know it would take some time but make it quick I can't wait and at the same time I am very excited. I hope you will draw your attention towards it Spotify india thank you boyz.
Honestly can't think of a complaint been paying for Spotify for a couple years now and one year they even gave me a Google mini that I still use. Genuinely nothing had I can say about this app. Maybe it could be cheaper but so could everything else üòÖ
"Hey there, just wanna comment on the fact that Spotify quit the ""see who follows your playlist"" interaction, I honestly think this should be available again because I wanna check the friends that follow my playlists and maybe see people who like it if they have the same kind of taste. Kinda annoying it's off now...I would have given a 5 if you fixed this."
"Why can't I swipe right to add a song on the queue with an Andriod? Why are the buttons hidden to 'Find a Song' in the playlist, instead of swiping up to search? The iPhone version allowed these features. I would love to enjoy them on my Android as well."
"Its amazing. I love spotify. But there is one thing wrong tho. For some reason when im at home it works but when i get to school it will sometimes work, but then sometimes it only plays like 10 seconds of the song and then quits. I dont know why. But if you could please fix this that would be great and you will get a rerating of 5 atars from me. Thank you!"
"Excellent app. This is known as the perfect streaming service. Although there are a lot of ads in the free version, but still it is good in other criterion like accessibility and quality. The navigation is quite easy."
Best app for listening music best music... Biggest library..... I love spotify all the songs I need are available on spotify..... My thanks to the developer of spotify.... Just some UI issues for tablet otherwise the best music app... I request to change the UI of tablet spotify to the same as in mobiles
"Highest bitrate Spotify can go with a premium subscription is 320kbps, which is a shame considering all the other great offerings from other streaming services. But the UI and the consequent UX is ways better than any other music app. Features such as Spotify Connect and the Discord integration also make it so much easier to share the music I love. Therefore, despite lack of Hi-Fi, I stick with it."
Spotify continues to offer a great service. It has enabled me to store different playlist to suit different situations and moods.
Really good aside the ads but the one thing missing is having a repeat button or repeat all function as by the end of the playlist it stops but having the repeat all would be nice.
"I like the way recommendations work here, much better than Youtube Music and Apple Music. But it lacks song's lyrics and the user experience for a play queue is bad: sometimes I want to add a song before currently played and it's impossible."
"I have been using Spotify Premium for over two weeks now and the experience has been exceptional. Easy to use, great curation, sharing capabilities, ability to play podcasts are some of my favourite qualities of Spotify. And great UI. Would highly recommend."
Joe Rogen brought me to Spotify. This fantastic app keeps me there. Cool discovery number 1: I prefer running the web version in Firefox on my killer Linux PC that is hooked to a nice sound system. The mobile app can control the web app sesmlessly. Very cool. PS: The music selection is UNBELIEVABLE!
Spotify is the best app for streaming music with curated playlists and great clean UI. My daily experience in Spotify free is awesome and it makes my every minute worth.üòã
"Best music streaming app on the market. Interface is simple, clean, and quick. Love that I can listen to music off line and share it with friends"
One of the finest apps to listen to music. Best radios and recommendations' algorithm as well. The UI seems to be sparkling too.
Just a solid app and service. What would the world be without Spotify? It runs smoothly and quickly (about 95% of the time) and has nearly every album on it you can imagine!
"I have trouble opening ""Artists"" Every time I tap an artist, it says ""Something whent wrong"" and the ""try agin"" button doesn't work. Other than that, no issues!"
"It's an awesome app and it is exactly how I imagined that a music app should be. We can select the songs we like the most and make them into a playlist and then listen to them as they keep going continuously. This feature is actually very useful and we don't even require going to our phones and changing the songs after each one. This feature of this app is very useful, according to me. I will just say that this is the perfect music app."
"I am very pleased with this app and have upgraded to the premium service. The selection of music, playlists, and podcasts is large and suitable for my interests and taste. Since I am a senior, I believe that other seniors will be pleased with the offerings in Spotify."
"It's great, but it could be 5 stars if you actually get 30 mins of uninterrupted listening when it tells you that you will, instead of just getting ads after every 2 to 3 songs. And the ads aren't able to be skipped. Theyre also quite long (30 to 40 secs). Apart from having way too many ads, it's great."
Pretty much my go to music application. Does everything I require of it. Replaces all of my CDs and records into a manageable format.
Love It! As a previous 1user of Amazon Music for quite a while I thought I'd give Spotify a go. Its a breeze to use and practically an endless library.
"Amazing really, especially it's simple but beautiful ui and it's great algorithms and not to mention the sound quality, the heart badge's size was perfect in the previous version"
I love the app. My only critique is that it has no built in sound search function. Having to Shazam first before I add a song to a playlist is a tad inconvenient. ü•¥
Significantly reduced functionality from desktop or browser versions. Seems to have issues reconnecting if connection gets lost and requires force stopping the app semi-regularly. 2 years later I have found the above issues mostly fixed and have had spotify premium for a year. Increasing rating from 2 to 4 stars.
"Honestly, after over 5 years of having Spotify premium I have to say it's worth the money, the amount of new genres/artists I have discovered is crazy. I've never had any major bugs, just minor glitches which got fixed in time and have used it on ios (3 years ago) android (the past 3 years) and on pc both windows and linux and the web client."
"Great app, most songs I like I can find there. Only some 90s songs are not there. A dislike button would be good too for some songs. Might help to get more accurate suggestions."
"Fantastic now! Great recommendations algorithm, good UI. Only wish it was simpler to find songs in your liked playlist without having to go through the three dot menu."
App is really great and fun to use find it better than others but lately there have been too many Adds which is ruining the fun I understand that u have to show adds but the amount of Adds I get is sometimes frustrating.
"Great experience, high quality sound and all my favourite artists in one place. Also default dark theme and intuitive UI."
This app is awesome . But I have a suggestion. Could u please give the guitar notes for the music u have?? Coz it would b really helpful for musicians to learn those melodies . This the only request I have. This app is super coolüëçüëç
Great service but interface still not very intuitive. Queue system is not flexible. Recommendations are also not the best.
This is such a nice app to browse music and also it keeps updating utself very quickly with newly released songs . and the daily mix which is given by the app is also very nice which allows you to listwn to new songs .
"Love the seemless control of music across different operating systems/devices. On Linux based OS (Ubuntu), there are a few bugs where it doesn't sync with my phone sometimes, where the ""currently playing"" music is sometimes different. Still not able to find a fix for that. Totally worth the subscription otherwise!"
The UI/UX of Spotify is so so so good. Each version comes with marvelous design updates. The colours on the latest version is so balanced for the notification player. It just feels perfect and also it changes and fits according to the Song cover photo. Thank you so much Spotify team!!! You're an inspiration üòò
"This is the best music streaming service period. The UI is simple and easy to use, the catalogue is extensive, the AI isn't horrible and it is so good for making as many playlists as you want. No other service compares."
"Great app, love the music and podcasts it offers! Only problem is its not super easy to cancel your subscription to premium! Nor apply for a student discount as my college doesnt seem to show up! Im a bit annoyed I got charged for another month just for the fact I couldnt find the cancel button but Its alright."
"Hello sir/maam, Here by I used Spotify since a year. It is an absolute music player. Hats off to your music player. But since a month I have a issue with your apk file. When I insert aux cable or connect with bluetooth, some times I don't hear song in earphones or via bluetooth device. When I restart my phone it works sometimes. So, I uninstalled your apk file and reinstall many time it doesn't work. Please give me any suggestions what I do."
I've tried them all and find Spotify to be the best music streaming service available. Great UI and has all the music and podcasts I want.
"Downgrading to 3 stars from 5 because even though it was a spectacular app, it's become frustratingly buggy over the past year woth updates, and with no good reason whatsoever, not like the UI or UX have been changed. Mighty strange, developers. Fix it ASAP please."
The application is nice. Sound quality is awesome. Interface is user friendly. The database of songs is quite huge I was able to find pretty old songs as well.
"I would give this app 5 stars but, if you don't have premium youget 1 to 4 adds. Which is quite annoying in my opinion. other then that i find this app amazing an simple to use and listen to the songs you love!"
"Love it. I gave it one star less because the older UI was much more preferable in terms of user friendliness. The current Spotify ""home"" has too much going on and isn't as organised as the older UI. Not a deal breaker but just my personal preference."
I love Spotify so much that my old phone permanently has a very visible screen burnout of the pause and play button/ layout burned on the screen. Definitely a recommend!
"Really user-friendly app. Makes finding artists & songs you love a breeze, builds you a new Playlist at least once a week based on what you have liked. Have to be on wifi or go premium to use outside"
"Spotify is well good. My only complaint is a few songs with sourced auidos get taken off for copyright, so being more lenient on the things like covers of songs and samples backingtrack would be great"
"Not a bad app, can be a bit clunky with the UI when navigating. I also got myself into a frustrating ""queue"" loop where I couldn't find a dang ""clear queue"" button..I do have a Pixel there's a decent chance that this is human error."
"Great app! Please continue to improve: - UI - song radio feature, as it can be the place for user to find similar songs of their taste - user ability to search within artist/album/other section"
One of the few apps that marries a reasonable free interface with a genuinely worthwhile pay-to-upgrade option! Great for playlists.
Still my favorite music app. I have used this almost every day for several years now. The playlist build feature is easy to use and flows well.
"The best music player in the world, even its algorithmic daily mixes are great. Easy to use with my Google home devices, and very quick downloads for playing tunes offline."
"I've been using Gaana for quite a while but in recent years I felt that Gaana just stucked to some fixed songs and mostly it acts like mp3 players where you have to tell everytime that what you want to listen. Now you're thinking that why I'm taking about Gaana on Spotify app's comments section...it's because I kinda like this app because I find a while new place to listen Music, podcast and calming tunes. Thank you developers for creating such beautiful app."
This app is easy to navigate and that beautiful UI makes it a pleasure to listen to music.If lossless formats were added it would be even better.
"Just had a great time using this service. Have used it for about 2 years and any problems I've had, support staff are very good at jumping on things as quick as they can. Huge recommend"
"The best thing in Spotify is playlist, all playlist has the best collection of songs. Then the easy UI makes it more usable."
This podcast is good for beginners or anyone looking for guidance in spells and wand work. The latest episode taught me lot about wands and has made me want to start searching for one that would vibe really well with me and encourage me to do more spell work. I am glad their is a podcast like this. I think it is absolutely amazing üëè üòç
"Long time user, always excited to see feature updates, very happy. But omg why not built in lyrics support and karaoke mode? And please allow me to not see notifications about new singles only full albums."
"Great app, been using this platform for many years and have only ever had very minor issues if any. Creating playlists and finding music is very simple but sometimes the algorithms for recommending music can be quite questionable. Otherwise, 2 thumbs up."
"Have been using spotify since ages now, and in addition to the music streaming facilities, i really like their customer services. Whatever couple of issues i've had in the past could have taken longer had it been a different provider, whereas in this case my issues got resolved really quickly. Please keep up the good work."
"It's worth it in a way but.... Go to the shops and buy what u want, u are limited with the amount of space u have. I've had this for quite a while, so. 10 pound a month, after a while it seems not worth it. But who hates adds. Everyone. U decide."
Making playlists is almost instantaneous as its algorithms select songs that might seem familiar to the user as he or she adds songs they like. The app is quick to launch and loads songs even quicker. Premium has to be one of the best subscriptions I've ever made. Worth every penny
"Overall brilliant app convenient and quick (as long as its updated). One suggestion, only a minor thing but small conveniences make big differences. When I had an iPhone that version enabled you to search for a song in the playlist by dragging down, instead of clicking on the three dots to get the option. Put this in the android app!"
"Love that I can listen to a full album of any artist. Tool, Metallica, System of a Down, or even Disturbed. I have been playing Bass for 40 years now, I should learn all of Disturbed music on Bass amd go get that job, I think it would be a perfect fit. Hmmm I just might do that. Dan is the man on guitar love your chops brother."
"Look, I know this real-time lyrics thingy is just new but I hope that you'll also be able to translate the lyrics in the future just like the musixmatch app. And one more thing, please add playlist folders in mobile coz it's inconvenient to go to your pc just to do that. Edit: why can't i sign up in spotify? When i create an account the button just keeps loading forever. Pls fix this i can't create an account, I can't join our family plan :((((((((((("
The non pay expirence is good. I used it for a long time to make playlists that suited me much better than Pandora's random shuffles. After using it for over a year and getting my first job they had a special so I could try premium for three months no charge and I enjoyed the luxury of being able to play songs on demand. The big kicker was when I found out I could listen to maximum fun podcasts on it I decided that the 10 buck a month price for premium was well worth it for me.
Good app. But. Still require some improvement like. There are lots of songs which I search on Spotify but. Don't get that. Songs And. This. App. Show too many ads. For non prime mambers
"Spotify allows me to produce personal playlists to suit my mood, need ( like going to sleep. Setting the sleep timer is also useful for this) & appropriate music for locations in which I am driving."
"One of the best music player which i have ever seen among many others in the same segment. Beautiful UI, nice Searching system, Lyrics, syncing system (loved it) Everything is so much fine and fantastic. Kudos to your team. Thats why subscription is costly. Sorry but for me its too costly as now but one day I'll definitely take your subscription. üòäüòä"
I love that i can create my own play list and then i get great recommendations for similar ideas and i love the sleep timer feature! I know that I can listen to my guided meditation and not worry about needing to exit out of an app.
"I'm a Google Play Music castaway and Spotify is the best replacement for when GPM is discontinued in Oct. Easy-to-learn UI, similar to GPM, Spotify has songs that GPM didn't, and they offer a student discount unlike GPM so I'm spending a little less $/mo. I'm a GPM veteran and I highly recommend Spotify if you're like me and don't want anything to do with YouTube Music ;P Spotify is üëçüëç so far. HIGHLY recommend to GPM castaways."
"I've been a Spotify fanboy since before it launched in India, so there's a bias here. However, I don't think any other music app even comes close to Spotify for one key reason. It isn't about the catalogue..it's about the curation that Spotify does. No other app can really predict my music tastes quite as well as Spotify, and I depend on their daily mixes and their discover weekly playlists every single day."
"Now they got the scroll bar fixed again, but there are still some quirks with the app connecting to other devices. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does. Sometimes it will crash on my phone if I'm playing a song on my PC and try to skip it with the ""remote"" app"
The only reason I'm not giving it a five star is due to the fact that they have too many ads.... It just completely ruins ur experience.....tho if you overlook that fact the app is just awesome.... I've found songs here that aren't there on any other apps .. So totally recommended. It's a good app
I'd love to but I can't rate it 5 because it doesn't work when I want to listen using anything connected by Bluetooth. Tells me it's not available in my country (USA) However it works fine with normal wired earphones or with the phone built-in speaker. Is this a Spotify problem or Android? This problem doesn't exist with my other streaming apps. EDIT 22 Aug 2020: a reinstall worked. Rating updated
"awesome app, has every song i want and more!! and all my favorite podcast, annually crime junkies!!! the g.o.a.t. out all podcast. love the daily mix designed especially for your profile and couldn't ask for more. not a crazy amount of ads and premium enhances to experience to New levels."
"Spotify is a great app. It's functional, aesthetic, and intuitive. I do think it could use more gestures for quicker inputs, like swiping left on a track to queue it up. It also could be more stable; I often have to restart the app on my phone because it has stopped playing."
It's a solid app. The UI could use some tweaking but overall it's decent. I prefer Poweramp's UI. CUSTOMIZATION is the main key.
"Ive been using the app for a long time, and it was pretty good. But there was a bug or glitch which wont let me skip when im out of the app. And if you know the quick acess bar when you slide down yoir phone screen, it didnt show the song, it only said advertisment when a song was playing. Please fix this."
It would be nice if I could get anything to work on this app without an error message popping up. FIX IT! EDIT: Thank you guys for fixing this issue so quickly. It had been frustrating to have an actually good music app not work.
So recently my Spotify isn't letting me play a song if I look it up. I used to be able to look up a song and press shuffle play and skip the songs until I get to the song I want but now this isn't even a shuffle play button so I can't listen to the song that I looked up. I hope they fix it soon
"4/5stars,its perfect for casual, even more than perfecr.The app freaking works even with no internet dye to smart download, nice ui and theme with all the larest tracks, what I think its misaing is lack of loseless music, I knownumber of true audiophiles is minimal in the country and with no access to sites like tidal, spotify is the last option if you dont want to buy tracks album seperately. But as an audiophile I think the app would be best if option loseless streaming was added evn fr extra‚Çπ"
"So, I used to love Spotify alot. And one of the most common things that I would do is search up a singular song and play it, but now I am unable to do so. It doesn't show me the 'shuffle play' button that used to appear, so it has made listening to certain songs extremely hard. Even after reinstalling it still does not show."
"Thr shuffle feature is rather a basic algorithm. Despite having 9 albums in one playlist, you will find time after time the same few songs get automatically chosen. So if you try sorting your playlist into the available headings ie album,newly added artist etc you willl have shuffled your own playlist. Otherwise the songs you played the most get chosen by your spotify shuffle button."
"Pretty great for an music streaming app , i have been using it for free though , it would be great if you make some stabilising updates , ui improvements . But i love it the way it is ."
"Great app if you love music, music quality and UI is also great, but if I turn on my MOBILE DATA and then try to listen to music, it dosen't work... Spotify please help........"
Its an amazing app for my youtube but theres a glitch and it really annoys me...When i press shuffle play songs either dont start or start but stop and i wanna know if that happens if the app doesnt update or if its just a bug...For an update can u add a button like shuffle play but if u press it it will play the songs that u listened to the most then the least is last because IM VERY STRESSED RIGHT NOW COS IF THIS APP DOESNT WORK THEN MY DAMN YOUTUBE CHANNEL IS GONE ;-; just plz help me..
This is really an awesome experince at whole another level with the live lyrics. The app design is too good. One of the that i dont appreciate about this app is too many adds....
"Low latency - searches are quick and comprehensive , very stable - very few dropouts if any, very good interface. Only problem for me is the sound quality, as I am one of those people who can hear the difference in quality. The quality is reasonable for casual and listening or background music but I would prefer that Spotify have a tier that has CD quality at least."
"The app does kinda force you to get premium but that's expected. If you are a free user then you'll quickly notice the shuffle play algorithm is soooooo broke. It seems to just play similar songs, I had a 600 song playlist with lots of different artists and it played two Gunna songs back to back and they were the only two Gunna songs. It does this with any artist all the time."
"Overall a great app, it has a few flaws like some lags in queue list and in shuffle and so...adding a lyrics option like in apple music will add A LOT to the app and to the user experience, most albums/singles that i looked for exist here and in various languages too, genius lyrics is a bit annoying and a toggle option for that would be good, fix the lags in the queue where song title gets stuck on the screen after dragging it from the list to the queue! Besides everything above the app is good"
"Spotify has become a part of my life that I can't live without. New lyrics feature is super cool.I'm a Spotify user from day one since they launched here in India.So I've experienced each and every major changes that they've made to make the current best experience.I'm really happy that they are constantly making changes to enhance the experience, great job developers as always. Suggestion: Search button on the playlist screen itself & long pressing the album art brings current 3 dot menu."
This app is great. My girlfriend had it along time ago and it has everything. This app has gotten me through alot of bad times. I thought about suicide and downloaded a few songs and it helped. This app changed my life. I have a whole new outlook. Thank you guys.
"I been listening to Spotify maybe for almost 6 years. But its just this month when I upgrade to premium. I love everything in Spotify other than the volume. From what I observed, Spotify music was quite modulated volume when i put on to max volume. But its fine, its only for my personal listening anyway."
"Great app for music. Nice design and great automatic personal playlists. Recommend trying out the pre-made 'mood' specific playlists, as these contain some fine hand picked tunes (you basically pay the music experts that make these if you have a subsctiption) that usually perfectly fits the description. Have never not found stuff I was looking for, as their music library contains basically all new music and a decent array of older albums as well."
"I've used nearly all major streaming services, I feel spotify fits best for my use amongst the others. I enjoy the UI theme and design, and the way it integrates with other devices. I've discovered more artists I've become appreciative of thanks to Spotify. I can honestly say i can't imagine my life without music, and Spotify provides me with more than exceptional service and ease of use. A solid 5 stars."
"Spotify is the best music app. But one problem ,only new songs by artists are appearing. What are you waiting for, click the install button. üëçüèª"
"Spotify is quite better then other music streaming apps I've been using spotify for couple of years and I've seen good updates for better experience, but but the lyrics should be pop up on others screens too and one can customize them like font and colour etc."
I love this app it's just that I can't shuffle my music. When I press the shuffle button right next to the pause button nothing comes up either. Otherwise it's a good app. Highly recommend.
"(05/05/2020): i've always enjoyed using spotify, even without premium, but ever since the last update (or maybe the last two updates) it hasn't been working properly. none of the podcasts i've subscribed to/search for come up - the app always gives me an error message - and the same goes for my episode downloads, which were initially working perfectly. edit (13/08/2020): everything's working smoothly, it got sorted out pretty quick actually (i'm editing this rather late though)."
"The offline mode makes your downloaded songs to suddenly stop, over and over like every 5 minutes. You must play songs with data or wi-fi if you don't want to manually press the play button."
The app interface is quite simple and easy with minimal design but the fact that it contains so many ads ruins the mood and the vibe...u could possibly reduce ads...
"This app suits my ideal type for songs as it is easy to operate, every song is available, and i can follow my favourite singer really it's a great app!!"
"Incredible! Able to build & edit my own playlists. Best indie & underground labels, hands down. Best catalogues. Excellent design & functionality! Affordable subscription service!"
"Okay the best experience to have of Spotify without Premium is if you're someone who listens to podcasts, if not the constant ads every few songs can get quite irritable. Using Spotify for podcasts is the perfect balance if you don't have Premium because you can listen to long podcasts along with listening to a few of them in a row then get a 30 second to a 1 minute ad every now and then. Spotify without Premium for Music is Poor, Spotify without Premium for Podcasts is perfectly fine."
"Awesome! Wish there was bigger selections of music because I listen to a lot of music that isn't mainstream. BUT I am happy I have more selection, easy to use/share/list building!"
I love this app! The personalized playlists are intuitive and have introduced my to many artists that have become favorites. Keep up the good music!
It's very intuitive and collection is also good. Just make it's equaliser a little better and make it less ad free. That will eventually generate more listeners.
All's good for me except i wished the music downloaded quicker. Also sometimes i do download the music to listen offline and when i check the following day i have to re-download... Otherwise all is well.
"Overall some nice piece of an app. On the bright side - pricing, sound quality, amazing daily suggestions and lots of new and cool music to discover. On the down side there's the app's UI. It's just unoptimized, or I could call it difficult to use, I think."
"The best streaming music app I ever used since 2k16, Pretty good UI, tons of playlists from official and other users. But the main useful feature that I always use is Device Connect, love it but sometimes the connected devices won't appears (almost every time), so I need to press play/pause from the device that I want to use. Please fix this."
Spotify is intuitive about what you enjoy listening to. I love the different playlists it puts together based on songs that you've listened to...
I love it. Can download the artist you love reasonable monthly prices for no commercials. Can make you own playlist and send to others when ever a song that reminds you of them quick an very easy. No issues at allüòä
"Great app for listening to and discovering new music. I find the 'recommended music' feature to be way off point sometimes. Also, I suggest when in a playlist, the search function should apply to your playlist for quick selection, not an overall Web search. Love it though"
I listen to spotify on a Samsung Galaxy s8 and when ever I get on a playlist I can't turn off suffle because the two crossing arrows will not appear by the play/pause button and neither does the giant green button at the top of the playlist appear to shut off or turn on suffle please fix this and I'll give it 5 stars
Been using Spotify for quite some time now. Love the app since it provides a wide range of music. The ads are way too frequent and disturb a lot.
"Amazing app. so glad i got it! Except now for some reason when I look up an artist, it won't take me to the list of songs that they make when I click on the names of them under the ""shuffle play"" button like it used to. It forces me to play the whole playlist instead which I don't like."
"I love music, and the artists I listen to deserve support. Spotify premium is my guilt free and cost efficient way to listen to/support all the artists I love. App has always been functional and smooth, while keeping things organized."
"TL;DR: The Spotify app has never been better. Long version: The most recent update has fixed every big issue I had with the app, and quality of life things that had been removed previously (namely the widget and the queue button in the bottom right) are thankfully back. There's still a couple issues, like sometimes a song's menu won't load because you're ""offline"", regardless of your connection or online status, but it's small enough to overlook. Thank you, Spotify dev team, I appreciate you."
"I've been using Spotify for years now and I'm hooked because the perks give you your money's worth. I love not having to deal with commercials. There are unlimited skips, I can choose and build my own playlists, there are sharing features and I can connect with other friends. Being able to use a mainstream music platform as an independent artist, it really changes the game for musical artists of our generation."
I really liked this app üòä it's best app to listen to music all types of music and our language songs also we can get üíØ It's a smooth going app üòâ and we can get our fvt artist new songs or resently released songs hear and it doesn't require full network speed ü§ü‚úåÔ∏è problem is it contains ads I hate ads ü•¥
"Love the app! Student offer made premium a possibility. Love the UI!!! Wow, now it also shows lyrics for every song. Though some songs are not available in the app."
"Very solid music app, much better than Pandora. My only complaint is that I have to get Premium in order to play any song I want at any time. This wouldn't be a problem if I needed to enter my credit card info to start the free trial. Why do I need to enter my information to get something free? It doesn't quite make sense for me. Plus, why do I only get six skips per hour? The reason I'm skipping is to get to a specific song, so having a skip limit leaves it up to luck. Besides that, amazing app"
"It's quite surprising that Spotify doesn't have Coldplay collection in its wide range of songs. I have always been a huge fan of this app, but disappointed about the fact that they're not providing good music (like that of Coldplay) & rather focusing on regional market to attract new customers."
Using Spotify Premium for a year now and the experience has been GREAT. While comfort and ease of use is top notch but some minor bugs do come up and destroys the experience. It is a hassle if you want to access the EQUILISER. Please DEVs add a shortcut for equiliser in the Play options. Its really annoying to go back to settings everytime I want to change somethings in the equiliser. Overall THE BEST app for streaming online music. Worth every penny for the PREMIUM. P.S Pls address the UI bugs.
This is the only place I listen to music and I love building playlists. My only suggestion would be to make collaborative playlists an option. üíúüíú
"Way Better Now! I am changing my review because you have really worked it all out, a gigantic number of songs are here now which were absent before, still some songs are unplayable, but that is overcomed by the imporoved and fast GUI. #appreciation"
"Apple music is fodder compared to this. The app is very easy to operate and the occasional UI updates keep the app feeling fresh. The family plan is really great if your getting Spotify for multiple people, SIX premium accounts for 15 bucks, great deal. Thousands of playlist updated daily for whatever you feel like listening to. Not that much to say really everything about this is great and no other listening service compares to it"
I'm addicted! One of the best UIs and algorithms to understand music. My discover weekly tracks are on-point every time!
"Sometimes it just doesn't play the songs I want, I click on a song e.g Sweden c418 and it plays lucid dreams by Juicewrld. It's weird and at times frustrating but overall the app works so yeah."
It's the best music app you can download on your phone to listen to any type or any artist and all kinds of music to listen to while you are at work or walking or relaxing or whatever you want to do and it doesn't kill your phone battery as quick as like YouTube will because Spotify you can still listen to it when you lock your phone but other music apps you can leave the app or it will turn your music off. Spotify is where it's at.
Pretty good and I use it everyday always... but someone tell me why its so damn difficult to disconnect from facebook and delete your account. Like please just have a button in the settings to do this instead of having to go through a bunch of steps on a website.
This is my go-to app for all music now. Best part I love about them is podcasts. I just love listening to them. It has very easy interface and good design.. 30sec ad in free version is the only problem. Which I think is fair enough for free version
I was a Google play music subscriber from the very beginning. Google play music moved to YouTube music and the GUI /experience was awful...plus I lost my YouTube Red subscription and Google didn't even tell me. I tried several different streaming services and Spotify's the best by far for me.
"So many music in good quality for free. Ads are not often, and not annoying at all. Actually quite on point, and sometimes funny or interesting. Very great app"
"Good music app, quite better than other, but as service luck a lot of music that I like, when Google music actually have it. Spotify app very comfortable with accurately made playlists."
"Needs clear and easy to use ""like"" and ""dislike"" buttons, needs play position saving for each playlist. Needs also easy private session switch. Otherwise good!"
"Musikk is my life and spotify satifys every need all day EVERYDAY.. From streaming to downloads. Even builds new ""DISCOVERY"" Playlist based on songs you listen to and genres.. Builds playlist of related artists you listen to and keeps EVERYTHING ORGANIZED JUST THE WAY I WANT with no effort..DOESNT EVEN USE LOT OF BATTERY..SPOTIFY PLAYS ON MY PHONE XBOX PS4 COMPUTER EVERYDAY.. AND NEVER LETS ME DOWN!!!!!! Never have i ever had a problem from this app AND FOR THAT WE THANKX YOU"
*_my phone doesn't have touch in alot of places so i can't create an account i have to use rotation but when i use rotation turn it upside wrote everything needed for creating an account but when i turned it upright i couldn't touch the done button despite all of this i know that this is a great app so i'm giving it 5 stars_*
"Love the service and the app, too. üòç It would be a nice feature to add that playlist could be searchable when adding new songs while listening. ü§û Otherwise, the app works smooth and has the best UI amongst similar (streaming and non-streaming) music players in Google Play Store. It's easy to use, looks stunning and all features can be accessed just when they are needed to be on hands."
"Love, love, love Spotify! Have all the songs I want! Even if I'm not paying for premium, the ads are quick, and often get the chance to skip the ads. Premium rocks!!!"
Edit: the queue button is back and I'm happy now üòÅ Although I don't like how frequently spotify experiments with the UI. Old Review: They removed the easy access queue button and replaced it with a share button. Spotify keeps making non-sensical changes and you have to keep retraining your memory to figure out how to do simple things because it's now hidden in a menu somewhere. Mega upset with this latest change.
"Love it overall, like how you can listen to any song at the click of a button. Don't like how you have a limited amount of fast forward unless you pay monthly fee and no play back."
"I'm a spotify premium user and have been for years. I enjoy the app on a daily basis but have been wanting something ever since I switched from iOS. It's really a minor QOL improvement but makes all the difference, and that is to add the swipe to queue feature, like they have on Apple. When using the queue feature constantly, you realise how much time you spend pressing the triple dot button, waiting for the options to load, then adding to queue. Just add this feature please, it's been years."
I have used this app for a very long time and it hasn't failed me. In fact i would say it has served me well. I listen to a lot of music so this is quite convenient. That being said spotify premium is essential since without it you cant listen offline or listen without adverts
This is a great app but when I search songs to go in my playlist I will press the plus button to add a song and it won't work but I can add songs from my recommended list it's really annoying that I cant add songs I search
"Have not got a single ad since I installed, most songs are present, so thats great. But i hope there will be a feature to quickly transfer some songs from one playlist to other. And many songs still havent got any lyrics. The algorithm should be changed such that i get songs to add to my playlist recommended on the basis of whats ON my playlist and not what I added recently to the playlist, cause I keep getting the same recommendations."
"I really love Spotify. Not gonna lie. One of the best digital platforms that updates real quick right after someone releases a new song. However, I think the price for premium is a bit pricey for me because I'm a student. Overall, I enjoy using Spotify!! #recommended"
i did not think i woudld love them like this but i deffinetly do. Especially if you take the etra couple bcks and ppay for premium. i love it. but i will admit that it doses not have quite a few songs. sothat bothered me a little. but i got on youtube an was fine ... and then right back to the app jesus lol
"Always qui k to find my tunes, plus the quality and selection are pro. I recommend this service to all kinds of people, and they all agree im the man. Thanks Spotify and keep up the good work!"
"Its a great app, but out of nowhere the rewind and fastforward buttons go gray. Also when u play ur playlist it skips through and when u try to press a certain song it just previews it."
"After trying out quite a few music apps, I can honestly say that personally I have found Spotify to be the best. After receiving 3 months free, downloading anything I wanted, my direct debits began. I was sent an email reminding me that my 3 months trial was coming to an end, and asking me what day did I want this to happen on each month. If I've had any queries regarding music or their store they have been very prompt in replying and always extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend."
Hey team there's a bug that the latest update didn't seem to fix and it's been there for quite some time - when you go to a song radio and you skip ahead a few tracks liking a song doesn't turn the heart green but it still goes into your liked songs playlist. Apart from this I love your recommendations !! Wayyy better than YouTube ! And the UI and lyrics/trivia feature are pretty slick too üíØ ! Can you also create an I'm feeling lucky button in the app that takes me to a new song every click ?
"Pretty awesome app, and the integration with the desktop, web and Google Assistant clients is perfect. 4 stars because when I have bad internet service, it has issues playing albums I've downloaded. It does work if I set the app to offline mode, but it's quite the annoying bug."
"When I click on an artist, I can't click the ""see more"" or ""and more"" button on my mobile. I tried uninstalling and clear cache but it still doesn't work. It have been bugging me for a few weeks now. Please fix it soon."
"Good music library, good UI, remarkably low power usage. Irritating: no easy way (if there is a way at all) to access one's own search history and play history. Search history is there, but truncated at about 8 entries, play history is on the homepage somewhere, intergrated in all the mishmash"
"I'm nothing but happy about this app coming to Russian Google store. Only problem I've faced was that ""the playlist"" button somehow dissapeared from screen of current track. It's very helpful feature in case I want to change my playlist. So that's the reason for 4/5 stars, but I hope it'll be fixed soon, in case it's a bugg ofcüòÖ. And sorry for my English üòÖ"
Super quality unlimited music at a very competive price. I have not yet managed to stump them and I have to say that they have an exceptional variety of genres on offer. They also mange to provide daily lists of music built to fit your every taste. Great Stuff!!
"In comparison with Yandex music - more power consumption on my Meizu 15. Please fix position of settings icon on main screen - no harmony in desigh. Please add more themes to design, what if I have mental desease about green and want to choose another theme in app. And please think about fonts design, chairs are too bold. Looks like native old android. Not lightweight but light is better by balance."
Spotify listened to its users and reverted disliked changes to their app. I no longer have any issues with the app and it works perfectly as intended. Genuinely appreciate this music service and company. Thank you for caring.
Intelligible music app... Quite reliable to free one from stress. Just tip in your vibe and listen then go on with whatever you are doing.
"Everything you need, every album, quick searchs, rad playlists. Excessively conventional with device pairings. Definitely makes mp3 players obsolete."
"Hey is there any way spotify would display the songs other than shown above? Because mine is different. And I can't play the songs other than using shuffle play button.I can't play it in loop, I can't play the songs to my own liking!! Also the add to home screen button is gone."
Best feature is you don't need a subscription to try the app unlike 'some fruit name' music app. Btw I have the yearly subscription and only because is so good. It is my first subscription based service that I've ever spent my money on.
It's good that you're now giving lyrics with the songs but it needs to be more subtle. You know it's just too bold and seems like an ameture developed that feature out of boredom. Kind of ruining the overall player screen. You could provide lyrics like one line at a time and fading it away when sung. And please don't provide directly on the main screen just have it one click away and also if possible a Full screen album poster while playing. Thank you.
"The fact is, in india there are some other streaming services available like saavan, Amazon music if you have prime subscription, youtube music, gaana etc. And those services have more songs than Spotify thats the fact but if you want really optimized app experience, really good song suggestions, ready made playlist according to your taste in music, and easy to use UI then i would suggest to go with this app. Why do you need Spotify? Its all about suggestions."
The app is great but the fluidity of the app is surely something the developers can improve. It always envies me how iOS users can just swipe in certain directions to do actions like queuing a song or opening up the media controls. Adding those features to Android would be a HUGE Quality of Life improvement.
"Spotify music has quite wider selection, gives bigger choices. You can hear music from every corner of the globe - you are not a stranger on Spotify."
"Spotify is simple to use. I am not technically advanced, so easy is a must. Then there is the music, I get what I want quickly and go on with my work."
"Dear developers, thanks for quite stable application. I have few suggestions: 1. White theme / themes based on different colors 2. When you see a playing track on display you could make swipe down to see all songs on playlist, for instance, like it realised in yandex.music Best regards!"
"my Spotify does not work when connected to Wi-Fi. when I log in, it appears that I am offline and the music tracks appear gray. fix it, quick."
"Really loving the app, hip hop collection is decent and quite a bit of variety with the artists as well. But the rock collection is still lacking."
"As a member of the 60s onward and back era I am reliving my musical past. Loving it, and pleasing surprised I still can sing and air guitar most of them. Egually I most have missed a lot. Long live the crochet and quaver. Particularly like the Live stuff. Long live musical talent."
"The application is very good, but please put the repeat button back in because I really miss it. And please don't put any more music from you in the playlists, I mean you should first ask us if we want extra music you should first ask us if we want extra music you should first ask us if we want extra music from you"
"Best app for music. I live in Russia and only now we can use Spotify, finally! So good quality, no bugs, awesome design, works even with terrible connection in good quality."
"Undoubtedly the best streaming service here in India. I've tried all the major ones over the past few years, switching between apps countless times. Finally when Spotify resolved all the issues in Indian version, there's no going back. It has wider library esp for English, best app design, and far better music recommendation than any other services out there."
It has now supported with lyrics in quite a good amount of songs.... If they will support every song with lyrics in the app itself then it will be the best app on Android devices for music because it has a vast variety of songs....more than any other app
"I would say, this is the best application to listen to the music in terms of every kind of experience.the user UI is really great which allows user to navigate easily in app.the most amazing thing i like about the app is it has really good utility of song recommendation. You can find the whole playlists of your favourite genre made by spotify and users all around the web.the premium version of app allows user download music offline so we can listen to songs without using the data again."
"I love Spotify! I love how you can listen to whole albums of your choice, i love the selection of their artist radio stations and I love the Playlists they set up for you based on your listening. It is very intuitive. I'd give it more stars if I could. üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"
I have never found an App more Perfectly suited to me and the way I prefer listening to music everyday!! Really easy to figure out & it has the best recommendations for you!! ( Lastly it's perfect for us Dark Theme fanatics ) :P
"The best music streaming service on the market. Definitely would recommend, also the prices in USD are reasonable, but I live in Russia and if talking about IT'S prices, they're SO low (In a good way!) that they just make Spotify a good deal when choosing between what's already available in here, crushing alternatives into dust. The overall quality of music is awesome, when you have premium, design of the app (both desktop and mobile) are giving ONLY what YOU need. 5 Stars - it is."
"It is a top-notch app, if we're talking about music. Spotify has the largest music database, very easy to use, reasonably cheap subscription, the automatic playlists are tailored to suit my experience and emotion. 10/10, would recommend anyone, who likes to listen to the music for long periods of time."
"I don't like the user experience, i have premium but i dont like the fact that everytime i click off an album it restarts me to the start which is quite inconvenient. I prefer the old 2017 look which was honestly great and the one that i loved the most"
"Overall a very good experience and music quality, and at this point I think I'm not cancelling my subscription anytime soon. One suggestion, though: please get rid of as many of the sharp corners from the user interface as you can. The design looks outdated, it would look a lot ""newer"" with more rounded corners."
"I like this app, I like it's simplicity and design, vast collection of songs, still has lot of collection to be added of the past, never the less. I appreciate the effort of this app"
"I'm gonna be honest, I was never a Spotify fan‚Ä¶ but the app has become decent over the years, featuring a lot of, most likely, user-requested features. The only thing I miss is the lyric search function from Apple Music or the sound search from Google Play Music. One thing that could really smoke out the competition would be an Equalizer. Meanwhile I still prefer Apple Music UI: though it has less features and more bugs, I think it's more intuitive."
"I've been using pandora premium for 10 years or so and I officially quit. After using Spotify for a month, omg what a difference a little TLC does...Pandora as an app and a service has so many issues that they just don't fix and the ease of use is never improved...Spotify runs smoother, faster and so far way more reliable and it seems like they're servers are way better. Spotify also has so much more content then pandora...SPOTIFY 500M+ DOWNLOADS / PANDORA 100M+ DOWNLOADS...There's a reason"
"I've been using Spotify for quite some time now, absolutely love it, its the only streaming source for music I use, has everything I could possible want, and then some, I look forward to discover weekly, and release radar, where I find tons of new songs that I like, some from artists I know, and lots from ones I've never heard of, but enjoy listening to, would highly recommend this app to any fan of music, to me, there isn't a better one out there."
"It's a great app for playing music, but only if you have the subscription. The free version is not that great as you can't play any song you like. I guess spotify is for listening to playlists while doing something else, but I use it instead of youtube because it doesn't require so much internet so I want to be able to choose songs."
The app is awesome. load times are quick just like any other app. The only problem I have are finding songs. When I try to search up a song and then the artist name It doesn't pop up but on my PC and TV it does. If you could fix this that would be amazing.
"Recommendations are great. Here I'll go for Pros - Cons: Pros: 1. Recommendations are great 2. UI is also nice and ligh weight 3. Can download music in premium membership. 4. And it syncs with all the signed in device, so u can controll the playback from any device by using the same app. 5. It has really good collection of English albums and solo. Cons: 1. There is no option to download only one song from an Album 2. Smart download is not there (for repeated songs)"
"I have been using the free version and so far it's quite nice, i am not having complains regarding anything like the music or design or anything but i can only listen to songs when i am in the range of wifi and not in case of hotspots that's the only issue i can find. Plzüôèüèª do the needful. Btw love the app.... better than any other music app. üòçüíö"
"I really like Spotify, I've been using it for about 3 years now. It has song recommendations that are relavent to my playlists, it lets me listen as long as I want. I don't have Spotify premium, so ads do interrupt and ruin my vibe quite a lot, but it's fine."
Good app. I would suggest removing the button for letting songs disappear in Spotify completely. I clicked that one way too often unintentionally.
"Love this app, but I have one suggestion. When you make a radio off of a Playlist there should be a button to add the song directly to the Playlist that the radio is based on."
"All over is a cool app, and helpful. But i will give 5 star if u fix the design of ur widgets on the screen, make it more stylish and simple like samsung or apple UI it will be more cooler i think."
"Love the wide range of songs. Thanks to Spotify, now I'm listening and enjoying never before heard songs too. And most importantly, it has made me forget my inbuilt music player. Can uninterruptedly listen songs on the go. Keep up the good work, guys!!"
"It's a good app, but have glitches that ruin you experience. Like when I connect to my bluetooth speaker it refuses to open for a couple of time, and have to close and reopen to make it work properly. Maybe it's the network problem, but the app closes sometimes unexpectedly. But it has a great variety of songs and so many new artists that I have never heard anywhere, this app does good job. Just fix these glitches. It would be better app."
Spotify is my way of getting back to my self and when the day is done all I do is push a button & realax ! To my favorite tunes bye god hand and Spotify I relax and enjoy the Toon's thank you so much for playing the things I like .!
"As a really old mod and musician who loves his, what might be called, antiquated music system. I've found through Spotify a means to listen to my favourites and quickly. Love technology"
"Spotify is the top dog of music players, been premium for years and have always relied on it for music, never once failed on me. BUT, where has the queue button gone??"
"In the latest mobile update, I can no longer quickly access the song queue from the playing screen. It has been replaced by a share button which I feel is pointless. Now to access the queue I have to click on the drop down menu and find the button which says go to queue. Please don't fix what is not broken"
"This is by far the best music app I've ever used. It's compatible with all softwares and syncs easily with the Musixmatch app. I'd definitely recommend this for online music. For downloading songs and such, Premium us required but Spotify Premium is extremely cheap and affordable too!"
"Love it, haven't had an issue with it for years... like 4 years! I love how intuitive they are of my tastes and select whole playlists for me and I always dig them"
Overall good and quite intuitive application. However at the moment no possibility to disable auto-play on bluetooth device connection.
"Best way to listen to your music on demand, way better than YouTube as there isn't add after add and you can save your song list to one place and make multiple different playlists to suit the occaction. Also you can listen while offline witch is a massive plus"
Still the best streaming service available. Intuitive menu and reasonable suggestion of music to listen to.
"Spotify is the best music app, you can build your own playlist and you can listen to hundreds and hundreds of good songs. I love this app and I think that is better than all the music apps. So thank you Spotify for give to me and to millions of people good music to enjoy Everytime and everywhere."
"Just the best music streaming platform out there. They, now, have lyrics of quite a few songs that I missed quite a lot. Just they let users clear their recently played songs/playlist from screen and allow users to change privacy related settings from app itself. Spotify clear lacks quite a few old Bollywood music & Devotional Music albums addition of which would be appreciated. Also, some albums are incomplete (one or more songs are missing altogether)."
"I wondered whether it was best to write this review about the app itself or Spotify as a service, I think we all know Spotify is a great music streaming platform so I will review the app. Realistically, the just works. It's quick, does everything I need it to do, rarely has any issues and it's reasonably easy to use. Spotify Connect is annoying from time to time but it sorts itself out. But, the biggest change I would make is the browse menu, I find it too very cluttered, change this for 5 star"
"Pirate to paid user. Back then I used pirated/cracked Spotify, because I just made the jump from Winamp. I wasn't sure how good the app on Windows. But then, slowly I realised I cant lived without them. At a fair price, gladly to say I'm a big fan since 2013 to 2020. Cheers Spotify! Mobile and PC version. To make Spotify more awesome: - MQA or higher studio quality playback - A deleted playlist section (Because I accidentally deleted my fav playlist awhile ago, its a nightmare to rebuild)"
"Spotify has been my go to for years now, and has never failed to give me relevant songs and good recommendations based on what I'm listening to. The app is user friendly, and pairs seamlessly between your pc and phone, while still being able to switch between the two easily, no pairing required."
Mostly good just having an issue with where the queue button moved to. I go into the queue all the time and not having super easy access to it is quite annoying.
"An amazing app but only if you pay. If you do not pay then I am acctualy sorry for you, you can't download playlists, it adds music that you don't want on your playlists, and you can't play serten music when you want it to. I gave it a 4 star because the money you ha e to pay is acctualy quite cheep..."
"Everything is great except adding songs to playlists should be a quicker and easier process, and on Android if you want to queue songs you can't just swipe right on the song, you have to click it and then 'add to queue' which is annoying and time consuming. Otherwise an amazing music streaming experience! I LOVE the 'On Repeat' playlist idea."
"It's my favorite music app , even though it has some flaws it is simply nice the interface and everything is quite nice yet probably the easiest to use,. But I would like it better if it had a history of last played songs queue to play it again when I come back to it . Overall it's probably the most refined out there"
Spotify has few features that most other streaming services lack and that's what makes it stand out more. I enjoy various daily music and their recommendation system is quite good.
"Best app for premium subscription, every other app followed suit. I have access to pretty much every album ever with auto mixes made for me. Even underground artists."
"This is really an amazing app! I downloaded it because i wanted to download songs for my videos on youtube,Then i cant find any download button on the songs i was listening......i would rate this app 5 stars if you fix this.....I really hope that you could notice my suggestion... I just wanted to download music"
"Spotify is pretty good. After the 7 day free trial i was a bit sad becuase i could only play my songs on shuffle unless i payed money which im not doing. Its not a bad app i quite like it. I dont like how you have to pay to get premium though.i also keep finding that spotify will add songs to my playlists, and theu are songs that i dont even like.but there is a wide variety of music and the audio is good. Its farely easy to use and i suggest getting this app if you are into music and podcastsüòä"
Im giving it 4 stars now because in the liked songs menu there used to be a search bar to search for songs now i have to toggle the 3 dots and get to that. Why remove that when it was much more convenient? The app in windows has it but why remove it in android?Its much more of a hassle especially when driving and is distracting and u need to find for the songs in your liked songs or playlist. Maybe have a search bar or a magnifying glass icon that we can quickly tap and search in the playlist.
"Four years of using Spotify everyday: best music streaming service ever. Algorithm for recommending songs is on-point, controls and UI are really concise, and the library has improved dramatically. Overall, can't recommend it enough. God bless the devs."
The integration between devices is phenomenal. The user experience is one of the best in the market. My only complaint would be regarding limited library due to licensing issues in India. My verdict: Go for it if the available library fulfills your needs
"Great software, just seems a bit intuitive at times. UI could do with work, but it found every song I ever wanted so far and i am not a young man."
I love Spotify! I have been using it for years and so far there is no artist or song I can't find! I cancelled my other music streaming platforms to use Spotify exclusively. I love how easy it is to build playlists and now there are podcasts on it as well!! One stop shop!
"Great app helps me find the music that fits me, but that 30 minute ad free thing is annoying because you have to stop what you're doing and open Spotify to hit the watch ad button, it would be way better if it was automatic."
The best app for music streaming. Maybe they can improve gestures in the UI (there aren't any gestures) These kind of design things
"This is quite best app for listening songs, but the only things which is bothering is that there are ads. I would rate this app 5 star if they remove these ads on free version too."
it's all good but quite often the autoplay option doesn't work when you search for a song and after it finishes it just stops and doesn't play any song
"I have never had any issues with this app. I like it better than any other music/podcast app out there, but there ARE quite a few ads. üòÇ"
This app is great. I love this program. You could find any song you want to see in this app. The capabilities of this program include: Download Quick Update High Variety
"The app's been randomly crashing while listening to music, it just stops. Tried restarting phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Even made sure my phone's software is up to date, nothing helped. It was a minor nuisance, but it's become annoying the more often it happens. Pls fix."
Everything is great the only problem is. I want like and remove buttons just next to the song that ways it will make app more user friendly. Trust me spotify people listen to it. Also give flexibility to add in playlist and let users edit your playlist when they download it. Please please just do like button thing. Please
Great app to listen to music on. Only problem is that sometimes it'll play multiple long ads in a row which can be quite annoying.
Clean and minimalistic interface. Big icons and buttons to easily access during a run. Best thing is your discovery weekly. I love new playlist suggestion that is based on my taste. Playlist is a better option that suggesting individual tracks because it help me to listen to the same playlist routinely during workout and other routine tasks.
Very high quality music streaming. The podcasts here are also quite interesting and like youtube you can create your own shows and podcasts. There is one thing sometimes it shows no internet even when I am on home Wi-Fi. I have to troubleshoot the app which is quite annoying. Otherwise it is a good app
"Very simple, clear and intuitive. Easy to navigate and everything is very sensibly laid out. I've been with Spotify Premium for several years now and I have no intention of leaving. However, I wish there was a feature which would allow the user to suggest a song they wish to see on the app that isn't already added. That would be cool. Because there are still many songs that aren't available (some for contractual reasons and some I'm not sure why they aren't available.)"
When I'm playing the drums when I need to make adjustments it always goes to advertisements first by the time I'm done adjusting song is finished. For some reason my drums become unresponsive quite often while using this app for unknown reason have to put phone to sleep then back up to restore the drums function has anyone else experienced that?
"Personalized playlists that are actually good, great selection, smooth user experience. Easily would reccomend to anyone."
"A great music app. Not only is it free, its very easy to browse music, store your own music, make many play lists and also every genre of music to suit and soothe all tastes. My favourite app."
It's a very good app for listening to music online. Even though I don't have a membership I can access a lot of songs and play them. There are adds since I am not a member but still it is comparitivlely less than other music apps. Good user experience
"Love Spotify Premium when cheap Pricey but worth it when it's sale or when you're travelling and need something to listen to when offline. They have audiobooks and podcasts, perfect for auditory people like me . Tried YouTube music Premium and didn't even finish the free trial. I love Spotify too much, Spotify has more audio content. I just wish that the premium version has a dedicated place for all the downloaded stuff and a download button."
"i really like the the design and how easy it is to use. however, i feel like the monthly payment is a bit too much for what it has to serve. i mean, there is no full lyrics even though you paid for the premium one"
"I do love it. Basic spotify has so much going for it by itself. Screen off, great music quality, and even your own equalizer to suit it to you better"
"I recently faced a problem in signing in because of some error I contacted them I appreciate there quick response and they solved it within 24 hours. Great service, MUST App for music + podcast lovers."
"definitely not regretting getting spotify premium, A+ song selection, great quality, an overall good time. however i do have a problem with the app, for some reason im not able to share the song im listening to instagram like other users are doing. this kinda sucks because i paid good money for the premium experience, and i feel like im not getting the maximum value out of it, a quick fix would be much appreciated, keep up the great work."
Love this app! I pay for premium since its the only music app I listen to and find all my podcasts at. It rarely glitches and its intuitive. Just great!
"Spotify is one of the most reliable, easy to use, functionally superior, smart, fast, fun, and intuitive apps out there - I could go on. It's awesome for music lovers."
Its really good and UI is awesome just needs more customisation options for homepage...like what to show and what not...(eg i don't like recent column) Some customisation options for homescreen layout should be added...besides many albums are also not available...Besides its really a one of best music streaming app. Thankyou.
"I like the fact that you can listen to full albums on this platform, but I wish there was a wider variety of artist from more music genres such as Indie, R&B, and Electronica. I wish the personalized playlist that are suited to my interest were updated more often."
"I love Spotify, its okay free but premium is really good. I like that i can add my computer songs to playlists so i can listen through my phone and that i get relevant recommendations and artist releases. I would really love a menu button to show your friends activity like on desktop though üôÇ"
"I've been using this app for a few years, and have always had premium. In the last month or so, when I'm connected to bluetooth stereo at work, it stops playing music, then I have to open up app, and song starts to play again? Why is this happening? Its happening quite frequently?"
I think its the best music app i have ever used. Its the fastest music player it never buffers . Its UI is faboulous. It has the largest collection of music. I just loved it.
"Used for over 8 years now. Clean, simple ui, good choice of tunes only missing a few biggies, and surprisingly simple billing and account management (went normal-student-family with same account). Good podcasts too, they're clearly moving with the times, and and the music recommendations are decent, I like seeing others playlists and what my pals are listening to. Don't really see why I'd rate any lower that 5/5! Cheers."
"90% Love this App BUT OMG please move the hide song button to the bottom of the list, I have hidden so many songs I actually like and some I can unhide and some I can't even find them to unhide them. Whoever thought that placement was good hadn't had their coffee. Just move it to the bottom of the list please! Also might be an idea to have an area all your hidden songs go to instead of searching several playlists."
"I can't put my screen to sleep b/c it will stop playing music.. It happens about 50% of the time. This is a breaking update. I literally have to wake my screen to continue playing and it stops again when screen turns off. On Galaxy S8+, Android ver. 9, One UI 1.0"
"I love being able to pick out music I enjoy, and being able to save it to my Library, its easy to find, and loads quickly! Thank you Spotify!"
"Moved here from Google music. The UX has a few quirks (queue management is harder than it should be), but overall, it does what it needs to."
"Great app, quite a few bugs with playback between devices and the UI, but on the whole I use this app every day and it does me proud. :) (please keep the widget)"
Spotify is amazing app that I have ever used. I found all songs and albums of any movie and artist. There is a üíì button which helps me to store songs when any songs hit my ears and it makes my playlists for me only.
"Switching to other app, thanks you for ruining my time, everytime I try to load my liked songs, it gives me your liked songs will appear here, I waited for eternity, It never came, I'm tech savvy so I know the workarounds, but it successfully has become annoying, Adios!!!!! Thank you spotify for all your bugs!!!!!!!"
It is a wonderful App bringing together the best of songs and music. The UI is equally simple and easy for selecting onr's choice of music.
"Excellent! Lots of era's of music to choose from if you like a various of genres, although I have noticed the older the song, the quieter the sound if connected to a wireless speaker. Overall happy with the service for the price, wouldn't pay more than ¬£9.99 per month though."
"First time getting music on phone. I'm 60 yrs old. Ellen is right. Pick Spotify when choosing your music. Classic rock & roll, blues, even solo guitar playing. I'm very satisfied."
No words but could say that it is a lakh times better than gaana the design of the app is very simple and attractive and also it provides a good quality music and each and every song can be avalible on this app which made me force myself to install itüòäwonderful app!!
Favorite music app love it but i would really appreciate having a shuffle button to shuffle all my playlists together I could use that randomness somedays or maybe be able to throw a whole playlist in my cue something like that to mix my many playlists. Lmk thanks!
This is absolutely the best app for streaming music! Awesome UI and all!...just for the non- premium versions the ads could be a bit lesser...that's the only issue although I've got the premium but when on non premium I faced this really bad issue of pop up ads...hope you guys can lessen the ads a bit. And that would make it the most perfect app for streaming music and podcasts!
"Its amazing all the music you csn ask fot you csn turn off your phone listening to it to! The only promblem i have is that like the first day i got it it let me choose the song... Its stuck in shuffle play... I love this app a lot but i dont like it how its stuvk in shuffle play and i have to skip to my song, also when i skip all the way to my song sometimes i run out if skips.. Because i dont have premuim."
"The best music player I ever used in my life... The most amazing thing is even the free version has controlled and less amount of ads, then the best feature is the song radio if you play a song then it automatically plays all the songs that are like the one you played, amazing and smooth experience, the interface gives a premium feeling and the song in the inbuilt playlists are updated daily."
It's a good platform for music but if you choose not to or just can't afford the premium the volume of the ads fluctuates from quiet to loud and using it to drown out the machinery while I work the high volume can hurt
"I've been a happy and loyal user for years but the new ui has killed it. at least pick a look. every time I flick from a normal song to a 'popular song' with a video, everything flashes and fades black - slow, not intuitive, and very disruptive. not to mention distracting while driving."
"I love the app, overall very clean and easy to use, but I would love it to have a full lyrics button so that we could choose between seeing only the lyrics or the fun facts"
"It's a great application tho! One thing that bother me is why there's no lyrics option in my Spotify although I'm # premium user and it's already the latest version? Does the lyrics option requires several conditions, i.e android10?"
We are enjoying music like we haven't for decades. Spotify effortlessly guides us to old favorites and new finds. We use Spotify with Sonos which play very well togethet.
Love this other than for some reason every time I turn on the play offline button itll load my songs (with the wifi) and then the next time I turn it on it has to re download all over again. That part is dumb. But love this app so much
I think this is a good app it gives you free music and all it requires is your email. It does have adds but adds help different businesses throw out to people there new ideas and stuff you wouldnt really know about the new stuff in your fav stores if it wasnt for adds.
"Second favourite music app, and this only gets better! Quite user friendly and very useful. A portion of my favourite songs are just random ones that Spotify suggested i listen to, its great for finding new music. I dont normally comment but Spotify deserve some commendation."
"Spotify has and always will be my number one app for music streaming. Spotify's great UI design makes the use of the app so streamlined and easy. New features are constantly being added to improve upon this further. Also, it's use of personalised playlist is unrivaled. It will consistently suggest songs from big named artists you may be sleeping on to underground artists on the rise. I swear this app knows my music taste better than I do"
This app has huge collection of songs. Also the sound quality is very good . Spotify is one of the most well designed apps out there. It's beautiful and a joy to use. I Love it. ‚ù£Ô∏è
"App is generally intuitive and easy to use. It also plays tracks in the correct order, which Apple play does not."
This app is amazing! I use it so often and me and my friends love making collab playlists. They recommend music depending on what you have listed to recently and it's very accurate. I have found some amazing songs off my recommend. All I would say is premium is quite expensive and I don't really want to spend that much money on it. I would love to be able to listen to the music offline although I will say there is hardly any adverts.
"The app is amazing, I'll give it that. But the problem I had was this: I got off of Spotify for a bit, then when I got back on my playlist wouldn't work, so then I tried another playlist but it wouldn't play either. I pressed the play button multiple times and even closed Spotify out and opened it again. I hope someone knows how to fix this."
"It's time you enable the option to continue playing even after I press on closing all the apps. Besides that, it needs to continue playing after a list of songs ends, or when I search and play one song. Don't stay silent, find something and play! These are the things that I find that are missing. Besides that, I guess it's a good up. Can't say I love the UI, but it's fine"
Really annoying .If you are not a premium customer then you shouldn't download this app the ads would simply ruin your whole mood. And the worst point is that the adds are same every time which makes it even more annoying . If you can purchase the subscription then it is worth it tough.
This is the best music streaming platform I've come accross till now. This gets better for oppo users coz they can pair it up with their inbuilt equalizer to get great quality music with out using any third party apps which is great.
"Dear dev teams. I found it pretty annoying that the ""hide this song"" button is where ""Add to playlist"" used to be at. I miss click it a few times and lost the song i want to add. Could be just me. But it would be great if you could move it lower or something. Thankyou"
Love this app. Premium is nice but not required. My only con is that occasionally the app will crash or stop responding to drop down controls while in the background.
It's very easy to use . And to find your favorite artists and songs are easy to find also . Great recommendations of genre you listen to the most . I would recrecommend this app over any others . Mr. Dexter Jagneaux
"Such an awesome app. Love it. Pay your artists more, though. And extend the Weekly Discover! The algorithm is just perfect! I eat up the new tracks all too quickly! Thanks guys!"
I love the changes and tweaks to the UI over the years. Its super user friendly and has an immense library of music to listen to.
"Great way to listen to music and podcasts. I appreciate that the main page is designed to keep track of the type of music and podcasts I enjoy listening to, and similar options. Thank you for the great service."
"Easy to use, great UI, tons of music to choose from, but can be a little laggy. May just be my phone but I can't confirm or deny that theory."
I love the music quality and the collection... However there are some parts in the app that needs working... Like the payment portals and overall user experience ..
"I have been using YouTube and paying the $10/mo for the no ads, and I seriously thought that's all I needed for a few years.. then a buddy of mine told me to download Spotify, so I did!!! Spotify, unlike Pandora or Youtube Red after I started to like a few songs spotify immediately started recommend great songs that I never heard, but enjoyed. Youtube and pandora still dont have down quite right yet but the spotify team is doing a noticeable better job. Thanks."
"This is an Amazing app! The best part is the seamless connectivity between devices - I play on my laptop, then it automatically syncs with my other devices like phone and TV. Again, I would say it's an incredible app, with an easy-to-follow UI Interface üåü"
Spotify is quite satisfactory but not extraordinary. I personally want it to be more advanced with varities of more new songs (according to the user's choice )
Spotify is amazing there nothing wrong with this app I would recommend you use this because I would say it's one of the best apps to use for quick songs you would like to listen to it's is also has great sound and quality when you buy premium it make everything better now you can listen to your favrioute songs with no ads what so ever and as a long time user of premium I would know so so ignore all of the bad comments and give Spotify a try and maybe you will like it just as much as I like it üòÉ
"Loved it, there could be a little improvement. In android we can't triple click the mic button for previous song, I have to constantly remove my phone from my pocket if I want to play previous song. This is a bad user experience, can you guys please fix this? Thank you."
"When trying to add a song to more then one playlists, it should probably be a lot easier to have to keep going back, clicking on the ""Add to playlist"" button and then having to redo that however many times for each playlist. I love this app, and I've been using it for years, but this is one major flaw that has not had a solution yet."
"A very good music app, both the PC version and Android version. The UI could use some beautification, so to say. Love the music quality."
"Very nice app with premium, but i have a suggestion. I like to personalize my playlists, so i make custom covers. Its only possible to change them on computer and iPhone. So if you would add a feature to Android to be able to change them from mobile on Samsung etc. Would be very helpful to quickly change it from mobile."
A really good music app with all genres of music. Shuffle play is also good. The only feature missing is in built lyrics.
"Fantastic music app. But it is absolutely garbage without premium. Like shuffle play. It was annoying enough with the adds, lower music quality and inability to download songs and listen offline, but shuffle play is pushing it too far. Ruins the whole experience."
It has very good custom Playlists built around your listening experiences to help you discover new music that you may find interesting. It also works well offline and is very optimized and easy to understand.
App freezes while listening. major upset when it happens Edit it freezes when I use phone back <- button instead of app back <- button... just found it.. Now it's fine
I had a good start to the app listening to playlist and now it won't play a song right it quickly pause and when you hit play it will do it again. I hope this can be fixed because I really enjoyed the app. It helped me get through a bad night at work.
Great value the first 3 months free is deffo a good draw but a lot of amazing music to choose from my only negative thing to say is the no skip button and you have to manually change a song
"This is an amazing app, and does quite a lot for free! It's almost a blessing, really. The least I could do is recommend this, because I find whatever song I'm looking for, even stuff that isn't necessarily from popular artists. 10/10, would recommend."
"I left to try some other platforms but kept comparing them to this one. Great UI and nearly 100% of the obscure music I sometimes enjoy can be found with ease. The only change I would like to see is the option to have 'shuffle all' option for my playlists, rather than creating an additional playlist entirely. A happy family userü•∞ Love love LOVE Spotify!!!!!"
One of the best music services out there. Love how intuitive the app is and how seamless it connects to my smart home speakers all around the house.
"I've just switched to Premium and made playlists using the app on my Samsung phone. However when I try and play my list, each track dies just before the end and next track is not played. In free version, I didn't have this problem and also album tracks play one after another so it appears to be a playlist problem. UPDATE: I just fixed the problem by reinstalling the app. Still annoying tho! PS: I contacted the tech team (email is listed below) and they were very helpful and responded quickly"
"I do very much enjoy the free flowing music, informative & insightful pod casts. Oh, and quite easy to navigate even for a luddite like myself."
"I love this app! I love the playlists that you can build. There are short adds in the free version, but after the ad you get 30 minutes of ad free listening"
"No words to express how happy I am to use and review Spotify..! I was using Wynk earlier and the buffer mode used to be functioning more than the song playlist..which led to very bad user experience..!.. But,with Spotify, all is really going well. This works very well in both urban and rural areas.The application is very user friendly and also I can finally listen to songs without putting my patience to test. Thank You Spotify..!"
"It's ok when you can get the right voice to the right song. I mean when I'm listing to rock mostly 80's & 90's stuff the voice does not match with my memorys, an hes sound, range is limited to a voice moddullater program. Digital Dave Duffy and his air guitar band is able to hake Spotify. I have 2 Spotify logos on my phone. Gettagettyagettyagetu."
"I love that there's options for premium rather than just one rate. It makes me exceedingly happy that the Spotify team is so comfortable with offering cheap premium such as the family plan. It shows they care about their consumers edit: I've figured out how to play without opening the app, and I'm pretty sure the music playing after I removed my aux cord is a glitch with my j3 prime. edit: just found the sleep timer! Took a little digging but I'm happy now!"
"Spotify is hands down the best streaming service today. It always plays music I'm feeling, the premium actually feels like it's worth the money. The customer support is quick, I've been using Spotify for the past 8 or 9 years. And I've built up a HUGE playlist. I'd give it a 100/5 if possible"
"Good streaming,not sure if quality is the highest possible (I have it at the highest setting) nevertheless quite pleased. Software has issues, eg after 10 minutes of playing it decides to pause. Also, when I am without wifi it asks me to download again the songs already downloaded before, therefore forcing me to go online and eat up mobile data. Despite it's been around a while now, there seem to be some problems with the stability of the app. Also, some albums are not complete, missing songs..."
They are amazing and it is fun to talk on here and you can do alot on here as well it it's good for each other and to have a serious conversation with each other and wow just alot of fun I can't wait to get on here and also we can build up each other advice and help one another out when is needed too.i love this apps cause it really helps out alot so I could keep in touch with all me families and friends specially the one that you truly honor and love the most and cherish every moments every day
I don't like that you can't select multiple tracks to move to a playlist or delete them or mark them. You can't select multiple playlists to delete or move or mark too. Extremely annoying and painful to do everyone separately its a quite a cumbersome way manipulate them.
This app is one of the best ways to get new and awesome music. It also shows in time different music that would suit you and match to your likings.
"Simply put -> Best streaming app there is, and it gives me the best music experience for a really low price. Totally forgot about my inbuilt music app. üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ"
"Probably the best music app. Great UI, Great Sound Quality, Great Playlists and podcasts. I would suggest you to add some more hindi songs as it sometimes happens that i cannot find some old hindi songs here. Otherwise, Its the best music app. Also you are increasing the number of adds, please dont do that."
"Good app...very useful for me but still unable to find some music and songs, some albums , plz share all the movie songs and background music like by piano guiter violin ( I fond of those music mostly) under the banner of movie name ... I couldn't find some albums of song sung by Bangladeshi singers, those songs are not so old but unavailable... Plz make it available.."
Overall the app is quite impressive but would appreciate if you would not put 2 ads in a row cuz i dont like my songs being interrupted but if you cant do that its fine cause i understand that you put up ads to make moneyüòÅ
This is really a super cool and useful app. I really enjoy using it and it keeps you up to date with the latest music and trends. The only downside is that you have to pay R60 per month to get premium which is add free. R60 is quite expensive for me personally but I guess if you have R60 a month to spare it is not that bad.
Mostly super. My battery optimizer completely ruined the Google Home experience with Spotify and it took a long time to figure. Spotify should automatically check and ask to disable it.
"Spotify is good and all (except it tragically doesn't play an Indonesian song in Indonesian region), but it's really annoying that the like button is right beside the play/pause button. When you just want to pause a song and ~WHOOPS~ the music got disliked, and out it goes from your playlist of liked songs. please do something with it Spotify..."
"Near perfect. Unfortunately, the file size and bugs ruin it. Apparently, if your SD card is too small, the app repeatedly deletes all your downloaded songs."
"Once you learn to navigate the app, Spotify(Premium) is Awesome. I listen to some weird music and Spotify manages to deliver on its suggestions (even when some of my musicians have less than 100k listeners). Lots of choice for Jazz fans too. Thank you Spotify for showing me Louis Cole, Shrek is Love, Thundercat. Thank you Forgotify for allowing me to create the FORSAKEN HITS playlist."
"Had an issue, support was quick and helpful. All the music and almost all podcasts I want to listen to. Superb user experience with premium and easy to use app."
"It pretty good, but how do you turn of shuffle these days, and also it won't play the music when I press a song, it just gives me a play button to play and it just goes random and I can't change it. Can you do something about that."
"Good app. Needs to be redesigned for podcast shows, it's hard to find what I've listened to and what I haven't. Castbox has a better design but uses too much battery."
"Excellent. The audio is perfect and I can listen to all my favorite songs, but I can't rewind the songs. I've heard that it's a premium feature and I don't have money to pay for premium so maybe make the rewind button accesible to all."
I can't live without Spotify anymore. The app is intuitive and easy to use. You can use it to connect to other devices and control what is being played. I'd recommend this.
The best music app for high quality audio. The UI is amazing in the app. The recommendation algorithm works amazingly well providing you tracks based on your listening history and likes .
"Recently this app began to be unable to tell when it's in online mode and I have to go into settings, put it in offline mode, then turn that off for it to acknowledge it's online, which is why I took off a star. Otherwise it's been good, I can access new music, my playlists, it does all the Spotify algo stuff for radio stations or suggested songs. I do wish it allowed for organizing my playlists, but that's about it. I have a Samsung and put it to launch with my Bixby button."
"ot's amazing...., when i switch volume level to quite, i feel that i'm diving deep in songs in spotify premium very high music quality.üëåüëåüëåüëå ....i'm fallin in love with this app bcz of its podcast which are avipable in english, so i loveüòªüòª this app ever...."
The recommendations for songs and playlists are quite good and the app also runs quite smoothly even though it takes quite a bit of space. 4 stars as there are selectively few songs and if you do not have premium then there will be about 2 to 3 ads after every 7 songs maybe but overall it is the best app for music and podcasts
"Pros: Buttery smooth UI almost like YouTube music. Huge collection of songs. Plays the songs faster than any other music app with even limted connection. Very less ads than any other app out there. Very well made clean app. Cons : Lyrics option is the confused üòï part. Most of the songs don't display lyrics and even if few other songs displays it, they are overwritten by story and we won't be able to view the lyrics which is annoying. There should be an option to disable story in lyrics."
After a slight hiccup back in April I was concerned that this was no longer the music app for me. But I am really happy that whatever was causing my app to crash is no longer happening and I am once again listening quite happily
"HEY, I enjoy using Spotify very much. But the latest update had made the control buttons so small. it's ugly and not easy to use. is this a bug? Please fix it."
"This is the real deal. It's intuitive and versitale. I gave it 4 stars because of the annoying ads. I had the full version for awhile, but couldn't justify the cost... So I deal with the ads now."
"It's nice but kinda weird to manage the random playlists, mainly the songs that already played and you can't see them till you find the right screen, rich is not an intuitive interaction."
"Love this app , premium version is worth it no commercials or ads and u can rewind and download for offline use ..... Does require some space specially if downloaded music for offline but I highly recommend to everyone !!"
"I give Spotify 4 out of 5. Let me explain, I have used 4 - 5 music streaming services; Spotify is the best one among them. Spotify has the best user experience and recommendations. By the way I am an Indian user, I listen to three languages English, Hindi, Malayalam. So, content vise spotify is missing some albums. Hopefully in upcoming days they'll be adding it. I am disappointed with discover weekly which doesn't recommend me malayalam music. So I am giving 4 out of 5."
"i accidentally deleted everything and an hour later it was automatically restored. the 1960's equivelent would be if you had a giant record collection, but lost it in a fire... and then it magically reappeared an hour later. we are living in the future, thank you spotify people."
Well I purchase the Spotify Premium and it'll be playing a song and it'll just stopped so I have to go back in tap on the pause play button sometimes that doesn't even work and I want to know why it's doing that because I paid for the premium so it just randomly stops playing during songs and podcast
"Perfect 5 ..Superb collection and ability to use between devices is amazing .. Playlists are just amazing , superb intuitive logic on song selection."
"Yo Spotify! I have a few issues about this app. On older versions, the app isn't very optimised, so it can be quite slow. Secondly, the reason I prefer using an APP like TIDAL over Spotify is because it allows users to swipe up from the bottom tab that says the currently playing song. I've seen this implemented in many apps and Spotify would be great. the now playing needs a refresh - it looks dull! Finally, could you consider the desktop version and let us stream any song with ads? > Shuffle"
"Great app love the premium fam pack. Best value, for sure. Only bad thing I can say is that occasionally it will stop playing after 2.5 songs... can't quite figure that one out. But other than that its great!"
"Spotify is pretty good and it's worth ¬£10/month for me to use the premium version, as I do hammer it. But it is quite short for more underground music, particularly electronic and dance from the 80s & 90s. This is despite many more mainstream artists having many versions of the same album available. That eats a lot into the promised 30 million tracks. Hence I can only give it four stars until they load up."
Love Spotify! I have tried lots of streaming services but Spotify has the edge. Slick interface and its algorithms and design make new music discovery effortless.
"Downloaded this to my tab like spotify normally it's on my phone. But it has been a nuisance to login, use or open on my tab. It refuses to cooperate on any level past the login page no matter what email's given."
"This is great app for music, but recently the ads pop up way more often, before the recent updates I would be able to listen to 6-8 songs without getting an ad but now it's like 4-5 also ruining the ""30 min ad free listening"""
"The application is working fine. I noticed after some intense search and play a crash of the application. It's possible to send you somehow the logs (if you store those)? Also after the same search and play use case, the UI doesn't respond as expected. Seems like the request to the backend is made only after some time and in this case the song is played with delay."
It is best free Version Music Streaming app in the world. It shows you relevant and genuine ads unlike other apps. It has a huge collection of songs. üëçüèª
"Been quite happy with the app and service thus far, didn't know how I went about the world without having a music streaming service, as it's been absolutely wonderful to expand your taste."
After constant using of 6 months I'm in love with Spotify. No other can beats this app as of free version. I've got all of my requirements from here. Also quality and collection matters. Thanks to developers.üíìüíöüòç
"All the music I love (even though some of it is quite old) . Easy to navigate, and the suggestions made by Spotify are for music that is exactly to my taste,"
Spotify has become part of my daily routine. It's so amazing to have a Premium service where you know you get top quality content in an amazing intuitive user interface. This work from home situation becomes so much easier when you know you have great music from every genre and great podcasts from the best in the world at your fingertips.
Spotify is the best but I accidently Uninstalled it then downloaded it back and now can't log back in. Spent hours and hours building playlists. This is really bumming me out. Please help!
I used to use pandora but spotify is way! Better. My only suggestion for improvement is to have something like a thumbs down or unlike button to not play songs you dont want to hear from artist you like.
"I have given fair and equal consideration to Apple Music, Pandora Premium, Youtube Music, and Spotify. Regardless of my criteria, Spotify ranks superior. Most significant to me--due to our current musical landscape--is discovery of new music. Spotify creates personalized Daily Mixes for its users, each one synthesized harmoniously from tracks in my library and tracks unknown to me. Just make lyrics available consistently, and add a 'play next' button (or tell me where it is). I üíã Spotify!"
Switched from YouTube music to Spotify and I am happy. Playlist function is awesome. Filled my library with awesome albums. One thing is disappointing me - library space is limited. Couldn't add more that 10 or 12 thousands songs. But it can be handled by listening daily mixes. Fresh and juicy music every day.
Awesome music app with a GIGANTIC selection of genres. Only downside is excessive ads but for free can I really complain. Just hit that watch button as much as possible for 30 minutes free if ads.
"I enjoy listening to new music before I go to bed every night. Spotify offers a variety of music such as soft and calming music, meditation, sounds of nature and many other ones to help you to sleep. They even provide you with a new variety of music that suits your needs on a regular basis it's amazing! I highly recommended it to all my friends and they also enjoy it as much as me."
I have only been using the free version for a few weeks and it is great for listening to music on my phone. I don't know what the paid version is good for or if they will eventually require me to pay to continue listening.
"Spotify is one of my favorite examples of good user experience. One of the best features is listening on different devices. I can start by listening with my phone and a Bluetooth soundbar, then switch to playing from my Echo in another room, then switch to playing from a web client in a third room. Great while working on different projects in different rooms throughout the day."
"Great music and past streaming app. Love the ui. but since last update when i ask Google assistant to play a particular song on Spotify, it is now playing wrong song every time, which was not the case before update!"
"I love Spotify, but why when I ""click to watch a short video and receive 30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" do I immediately get 5 back to back ads after the video is over? This happens quite often"
"I love the list of songs Spotify puts together for me. I also like the ease of building my own song lists, and using my favorite songs as a song list. Great app!"
"I truly believe the only thing stopping this from being the best music player software of all time (windows media player, napster, QuickTime, winamp, iTunes, etc) is a higher end in app equalizer. More bands than my phone or truck. For the best playback possible!"
"I love it! It's good to have all your fav songs on one platform that doesn't take up that much space rather than downloading tons of songs that take up much more space, i only have one problem with it which is that not everyone has the money and the ad's ruin the vibe."
"Must have app for music fans. Absolutely awesome, dynamic app that never falters. For ¬£9.99 a month I've all the music I could ever need at the tap of a button. This app is also brilliant and discovering new artist's for you and will continue to play music similar to what you've chosen. So the music never stops. An album finishes and Spotify finds more suitable music for you. Best ¬£9.99 a month ever. Also you can link this app to PlayStation and many many other devices."
"Spotify's a great app for listening to music whenever and wherever. The only problem I have is that once they've made a proper UI change that improves the quality and ease of use for the app after a while, they later on remove those improvements and make it worse and much more complex as well as time consuming to navigate the application. You get used to the changes sooner or later but it still subtly annoys you every now and again."
"I love this app but hey nowadays when I go offline, the songs I've downloaded suddenly stops playing and I don't know why, like after 2-3 songs and then it'll stop mid-way again. I have to manually play it and then it stops again. Idk if it's a bug but it's been going on for me quite lately. Pls fix this."
"Adding the ""Hide this song"" button to the top was the worse idea they could've have and it makes adding to playlists frustrating, especially if you're grabbing songs from bigger playlists."
"Just amazing app I listen to on Spotify but I want it to allow download feature as I don't want to pay subscription and the ads are quite annoying at times, otherwise it's all good"
"being a student with chaotic moods, this is a good companion. ive started using premium because ive been guilty of pirating vids into mp3s. besides, it's good to just search for the songs straight from their albums. i also get to find playlists other listeners have to try. although, sometimes i wish there's multiple select when i'm adding/removing them on a playlist."
I love the variety of songs and the ability to listen to the songs offline I also love that there are so many podcasts available to me at the click of a button and that's one of the best music apps I've used.
Really professional UI and the suggestions of songs and the quality if the music are awsome. It feels very comfortable to use and those who using the Spotify will not switch to any other apps.
"Absolutely amazing app!!!! There are quite a lot ads if you don't get premium but it's still really good without premium! I would recommend premium because it lets you listen to music with no ads, listen offline and it lets you listen wherever you are. This app has such good quality music and lets you listen to anything! Plus it doesn't take up hardly any of your storage. Thank you."
"Easy to use and create a play list and skip through, subject to the options you have selected. There are a wide variety of music genre's and all at a click of a button. Spotify also collates sings you listen to and provides selection of song you may want to listen to, in cluding the options of listening to your favourites artists songs or play lists and a radio option and new releases. Some. Time. Spotify can freeze but for a few minutes."
"I was with the -other- music service for a long time and I kind of listened to a lot of the same stuff over and over, and only found new stuff I liked with Soundhound. Since I finally switched to spotify, after reading rave reviews about its music suggestions algorithm and intuitive playlists, I never looked back. I constantly get playlist suggestions that are in tune with my general preferences and I keep discovering great artists. I really love it."
"Love it but the UI is a bit clunky and podcasts lack functionality, neither of which prevent me for using it as my go to app for music and pods."
Up to date in new tracks and great quality when streaming. Quite a wide range of music more than any music apps I used before.
"Naw, Spotify, put the repeat button back where it was, please - easily accessible from the main ""now playing"" playlist menu, the minimized playlist menu AND from the lock screen."
"Great content and interface! Ability to use the app seamlessly between devices live is amazing. The user interface, is friendly, and the user experience is excellent. The best app in the world for music lovers. Highly recommended!"
The perfect answer for those who love music of all genres. I have been delighted by the depth of the Spotify catalogue and the clever way it opens doors to artists tou never knew existed which quikly become firm favourites. Excellent!
"I love Spotify, I can find pretty much any song or artist with just a few taps of a button. I love music so this app is perfect for me and my music needs."
"It's terrific except once your past the 7 day initial use period they start to censor your access to build out your ""likes"" and the app will not wait for you to touch an accept to get the 30 minute bonus periods. Otherwise I'm thoroughly enjoying this well conceived app, although it does tax your process speed."
"Spotify is fantastic. but there are connectivity issues for me. quite often. kind of a bummer but I'm a dodo head, so i stay subscribed. edit: left for a year but I'm back baby! 2k20"
A perfect music app. Very convenient to use and especially its interface. Just happy with it. It requires some tweaks but other than that everything is completely fine.
"Seriously man it has almost all the international content. I am a ginormous fan of jpop and jrock. Spotify has all the latest artist's releases and almost all the artists' collections.Great and convenient UI and dark theme,which I am fond of.Great experience of the shift to spotify from savn."
"The Best ! The design and song recommendation is excellent. Please add : Number of songs in a playlist, same like desktop app. Also need an option add multiple songs to a playlist."
"One of the things I liked the most about Spotify are the new song recommendations that are made based on our fav songs..it knows quite well what songs we will like, most of the times, thus helped me discover more songs that are to my liking :)"
"The connectivity of this app is excellent. I self intuitively finds all your device to allow you to listen to your music, laptop,phone, smart TV, car etc. Just simply works, and clean clear non interrupted music. Also gives you daily lists of the kind of music you like best by narrowing down your taste in music."
"would give it 5 stars if it had its own custom full screen music player when the phone is locked, take for example the Naver music app. I don't like this tiny strip, I'd much rather have bigger buttons and I want to see the album art clearly, not just a tiny square... Biggest pet peeve that I have with this streaming service."
I love this app so much. However I accidentally hid some song that I love when I didnt know what that button ment. I cant find a way to unhide them and it's kinda annoying. If you could fix that please that would be great.
"Best music app, been using for 6 years. Would love to see a feature where I can create a playlist and the song start time can be customised. Other than that, all the updates and ui changes over the years has always been great. Get it now"
"I like the variety of the way I can listen, from the quality, to listening to only the song I searched for or continue to listen to song that are similar, or adjusting the built-in EQ to match my audio system."
"This app is good if you have premium, of course. All my favorite artists are there and all the songs I like. But there's one thing I absolutely hate: the hide this song button. So many times I wanted to add a song to a playlist but accidentally hid it because this hide song button is at the top. Why at the top? And yes, I wrote this review after I accidentally hid a song again. It feels like biting into something that's supposed to be soft and suddenly you hear a crunch."
"As an engineer that build apps as a professional, I appreciate Spotify to the fullest. Thank you for becoming such a service/product. Spotify is simplictically beautiful."
Haven't come across any song I could not find in the nearjinfinite Spotify library. Reasonably good AI with regards to its ability in working out my taste in music. Quality from my Samsung Galaxy S10 is more than satisfactory. Adverts are not too obtrusive; I quite enjoy the disruption - feels more like listening to radio. Highly recommended.
Really good playlists based on your search history. Appropriate customization. Still can be improved over UI.
I used all the available apps on playstore. Spotify is one of best i found. Its very well designed to get you kind of music you want to listen.
I like the interface since it makes it easy for me to find some of the features quite easily. The music selection is insane so i am quite happy with it.
"The first week was amazing! I got the exact music I wanted to, guessing the premium subscription. Spent the whole week perfecting Playlist and building my library, skipping the songs i didnt want to hear. Then the first week ended and it's commercials and only 6 skips out of music that isn't in your playlist. I can no longer use my library so my whole first awesome week, was a waste of time! Thanks spotify, back to Pandora which is about the same, but they didn't waste a week of my life."
"I love it. Easily worth premium imo! My only nit-pick with it is that the hide button is right above the add to playlist option, which is a bit annoying since I accidentally click the hide option since they're so close to each other. Besides that, I love it"
"The sound quality could be way better. I don't care for some reason that some songs are quite then other songs, ( why is that ? ) On the other hand I like the very wide selection of this app."
"I really loved the button next to the setting option on the home page to go through the latest releases, by the followed artists. Please bring that back."
"Epicsauce, except songs arent available everywhere which is a tad bit annoying. Living in a smaller country like Sweden it can be hard to find all the songs you want, though since the unavailable songs are quite few it doesnt really matter too much. Overall, a great app."
"The UI is a bit wonky when you want to mass edit your collections, but other then that when used as premium it's spot on. Useless when free."
The only app I use for music. They actually have Playlists designed just for you that are made daily. I love this app better than Pandora and if you have Spotify Premium then you get Hulu for free.. You can't beat that deal!
"Switched between lots of music streaming (deezer Napster Amazon Google apple etc) and this it one of the better ones. It doesn't have as high quality kbps as deezer but makes up for it in the ui, recommendations and available songs"
"Great from the very beginning. And you can tell this app is the best when the competition compliments your work but then has a little problem with it but it compares it to their own app that way if people read the review they will check that app and download it, being a crappy app and from India, but from experience don't do it, simply, their app suxz soooooooo much you be wasting your time. Keep up the awesome Work SPOTIFY team you have gone and left your mark on this world and we love u 4 it."
"Best music app. Just some features that could be added. The one that I would like to see most is an ""add to queue"" feature for playlists. Currently, if I want to add a playlist to my queue, I have to add each song individually and it is quite a time-consuming method. Otherwise, the app is amazing."
"Absolutely love this app!! I've upgraded to premium and find it so much better to listen to my favourite songs without all the disruption of ads. I enjoy listening to music either while I'm cooking, cleaning house, in the shower, BBQ-ing, cruising, or cutting the grass in summer or shoveling snow in winter (using my wireless Bluetooth headset of course lol)"
"Top app 4 tunes. Not too many adds, just annoying enough to force you into a premium account. Nothing like some INSURANCE sales to ruin your jams on a chillout session. yeah learn when I'm crashing, then bamm.. that add you love so much.. cranking at least a %20 volume increase (Legal in aus? Not sure. TV & radio only get %10, I think) I never checked? Worth upgrade not have to hover over volume constantly. Grumpy neibours don't like the free version..üòâ"
"Very impressive indeed. Intuitive contols and settings. Ease of operation. Wonderful array of artists. Previously I had iTunes and I was sceptical of Spotify. But now I won't go back to iTunes/Apple. Everything I need is here at Spotify. And I am an ""older"" user at 60 years of age. I recommend it to all."
"Great music collection. One of the best user experience. Also, one recommendation, improve algorithm behind auto playlist collection."
"I enjoy listen to Spotify :)). There are many available songs and the podcasts are awesome!! There are ads, and though they are quite annoying, I don't really mind them :)))."
Recently I've shifted to Spotify app to listen podcasts and music both. One good thing about this app is that it takes quite less mobile data to buffer songs online as compared to others providing high quality voice quality. Area of improvement is more Bollywood songs can be added in the library.
"Love the ability to save playlists of songs I like. But with the free service the commercials have gotten stupid. They make you push a button for 30 uninterrupted minutes. No big deal. Except that if say, you're driving, or working , and can't reach your phone they take advantage of that by making you listen to 2 or 3 minutes of commercials. This is especially lame when it's the same commercial (usually for Spotify no less) 4 or 5 or 6 times in a row. Give me a break! Otherwise it's great."
"The Library feature needs to be more comprehensive. This app is so much better than Apple Music, but when it comes to library management, Apple Music wins because you can add individual songs in the library, but if you want to discover new music, I think Spotify is better with its algorithms at work, and the app is also very well built and is uniform across platforms."
"I've collection of 50K songs in my hard drive but Spotify takes you to another level. You can get customized playlist, very high quality Music and podcast! It has in-built feature that normalizes audio according to your choice. But there are many bands from 80's and 90's are missing. I hope they add them soon!"
Offers high quality music free of cost. Also the UI of this app is very attractive and convenient to use. Hands down best song streaming app.
"The App is amazing, it is really user friendly, and it has all my favorite artists on it. The UI is great too. What more could a person want? Way to go spotify, you have done a great job. I haven't found a better app for listening to my favorite artists and albums. Playlists are spot on as well. Thank you for all you do to make this app as great as possible!! Keep up the good work!!"
"Discovering songs new and old that I never could have never afforded or had access to growing up buying cds and vinyl. Would be better if the artists could make more money through Spotify. My only niggles is having to drag and drop songs when I edit playlist to put them the order I want. If was a way to make quicker would be perfect, very time consuming. And I have to constantly block ty segall cover of everyone's a winner, it seems to come on my daily playlists/discover. Song does my nut in"
Love having a premium family account. I enjoy it more than Pandora because if I want a certain song I can just look it up. Ive discovered so much good music based on my taste and the daily mixes they build off of your taste are great. I absolutely love Spotify. No commercials no bs.
(Resolved) I remember using spotify before and it would never play songs that weren't in the playlist. I find this quite annoying because I have a preferred taste in music. (Resolved)
I live on Spotify üòÇ my only complaint is the shuffle-only on standard accounts on mobile. If I'm allowed to pick specific songs on a computer...but I digress. I genuinely like Spotify better than Apple Music üëçüèª
"Fab! Allows me to get music of any genre when away from traditional music sources or don't fancy the radio. Great being able to search & save songs to a mixed playlist. I don't use premium as ads don't bother me, but can see the benefit of being able to play without wifi or data. The preset choice of playlists is great, especially when you need something specific, such as meditation or something to suit a group of people with different tastes. Definitely an app I wouldn't be without."
Great customer service. Really enjoyed the convience of texting through my problem with the student plan. Very nice operator. Spotify really is a game changer in my life. Helped me learn guitar and learn music. Love this app.
"Overall you guys are tops at what you do but there could be some improvements in your selections ie, more deluxe albums and remixes free offline even if its a limited ammount. Say twenty. Bren having difficult downloading songs and even accessing artist info to add new songs to my playlist."
This app is quite reliable. It's all good and feel good app. Plus there are different playlists which you can choose according to your mood. I recommend.
"Amazing algorithm, finds related music very well. Great UI. But I sometimes get the same song in shuffle mode. Check that out."
It's great. The song queuing is a great feature and the offline listening to downloads is great especially when traveling when there is no phone service
"it's easy to use, you can even let it go to your homescreen for quick accessibility. Although, if you go through the shuffle, sometimes it will or won't add random music that isn't on your Playlist and it makes it inconsistent."
The expectation with this app is more than I thought it had. And the premium packages are also economical and are prepared as per requirements which is a very good development. But the only thing I feel missing is old categories of songs either it may be albums or movie oriented. Otherwise its all good!!!!üëç
Bust a hard drive and lost a load of downloaded music so while that gets repaired switched to Spotify. Can't fault it as a substitute. Very intuitive. Even talks to multiple WiFi speakers. Pretty top notch so will remain in my back pocket for quite some time.
Happy with my decision to pay for Spotify. I love music and love the suggestions it offers based on my listening habits. Only frustration is when connecting in my car. Despite it being illegal to use your phone Spotify frequently requires interaction on the move. Can be frustrating. Worthy of 5 stars overall though
"Though Apple Music seems to have a bigger song collection than Spotify, the way Spotify suggests similar songs is awesome! Also, I like the variety of playlists and the dark UI. Keep up the good work, Spotify Team!"
"The app is great, but i give 4 because i find something odd. The song plays as if someone is throwing a ball suddenly on u. It should have a little build up. Plzz consider it if u would likeüòÅ"
The stream quality was quite good but I wish the downloaded quality could be better. More bass and clearer in high notes. It would be much better if users could make adjustments to dB. Like an audio tuner or something like that.
"I really love Spotify, now that they've cleared the Warner issue. As I had told earlier, I have kept my promise by upgrading to Premium. Spotify is now really my favorite music app. Now Spotify just has to make minor changes to it's UI, and also maybe bring the Voice Search option to compete with other major music apps. Thanks Spotify!!! üíöüíöüíö Some changes I want in the next updates are : *Voice Search*, *Canvas*, *Serial numbers against songs in chart playlists* etc."
Literally cannot live without this app. Used to use apple music and my iTunes but when I switched to android I discovered spotify quite a few years ago. Can't tell you how good this app is. Way better playlists on this compared to apple music and the process is simple to create your own playlists.
Been using for a few years now. User experience is excellent save for a few quirks - for example finding all songs by an artist via an artist page is difficult. Instead you have to simply search the artist and not select their page. The adaption of suggestions to your tastes and listening habits is impressive (and maybe slightly worrying!). The range and quality of music is incredible. Connectivity options are also great.
"Most suitable app. I love listening and singing the songs. But sometimes I don't get that song that I want to listen to. But very cool. But one problem that it does not play songs offline üòí For playing offline you have to pay. I hate this rule all else everything is fine and YES!! This app makes my mood calm, emotional and romantic üòçüòç üëèüëèüëè"
"Easy listening , predictive daily mixes bring new sounds to my ears. I use the free version and find 30 minutes of ad free music quite sufficient for my needs."
"I wish there was more functionality, like being able to set custom order of music within Playlist. Another thing is stuff like Google Assistant controls, you should be able to add songs to Playlists, not just like them. Furthermore, the menus and ui is a bit clunky and simple things like searching within Playlists is cumbersome."
"Anything you can do on web or desktop, this app offers too. Doesn't crash, looks good. On the other hand, still a Spotify product thus a total nightmare to navigate around, a huge operate-and-drive hazard, a disastrous song queing logic, etc. Basically a user experience fiasco. However wouldn't be fair to drop more than one star as it delivers in all other aspects."
Love it just to download your music click the top dark right button until turns green(after you click on a playlist) thats how you download your music to.play anytime. Spotify anyway to point this out; didn't know this until 4months later having Spotify lol
"Better in almost every way! Congrats to Spotify for improving on most of its complaints and listening to its customers. Lyrics are back and now on mobile!! Genius is mostly gone (I think) and replaced with 'Storyline', a welcome change. That, combined with ease of use, podcasts, increasingly better playlists and suggestions are distancing Spotify from its competitors. I still think the 'new' Home page could be polished and made smarter, more useful, better designed (it's a bad Tidal ripoff)."
"I have been using spotify for years now and I just love,love it i have made many playlists to suit my mood or if I'm driving etc...i have found no problems with this app even when i do updates i don't listen to the radio but I'm still up with the new music or bands as spotify makes a playlist by your type of music and includes new releases. Keep up the good work spotify."
"Music sounds quality are best, friendly UI easy to use & play music most important things Spotify have different type of options given to enhance the listening music experience. üòç"
"I loved this app a lot. Cool , easy to use. Simple and quickly accessible interface. No bugs. Meaningful features and lots it got in it's positiveness."
I just fall in love with Spotify music! And Spotify is one of the best music platform i found! Gradient UI is one of its best practices to distinguish the UX from other ones
"I genuinely don't think I could survive without music, and Spotify is the beat app to listen to music with. So it's definitely worth it."
One of the best music apps out there. Their music playlists are just awesome and UI is great too. Highly recommended music app.
Great APP. Im finding that every 3 or 4 songs in offline mode cause my app player to crash requiring a restart. Ive gone online and it works no problem just with offline mode. Thanks keep up the great work
Best you can ask for nowadays. Spotify eliminated the need for keeping music files anywhere. I do have an issue and that's not being able to turn off or remove any recommendations of the country you're in compared to the one you want. Arranging the playlists is also kinda of a pain. Doesn't feel very intuitive.
"Spotify is wonderful ive been using since day one üòç Its the best for offline to play your saved playlists just all your favorite songs still good to play and enjoy, definitely good when you have your mates or family over for dinner or quiet drinks, even to set the mood, i can even enjoy pod cast üòÅ Thanks guys for making lives better for music and pod cast enjoyment a big thumbs up from me and my family üòò"
"It was a bit hard to find my way around at first, the layout is not as intuitive as it could be. It took a while to understand how playlists worked, however, now I'm past those first uneasy steps I genuinely love this app. I have managed to reconnect with so much music that I thought I had lost forever. So, for me this is easily the best music app out there."
"The UI could be better. I think there should be a search bar at all times in the Liked Songs playlist. Plus, when you look at an artist's page, you should be able to swipe to the left or right to go to the songs that are in your library. The app experience is pretty good, but I think more could be experimented and improved."
"Intuitive, easy playlist management and good download quality in general. Lack of configuration options tho."
"This app is great, and is definitely worth paying $10 a month for premium. My main gripes with the app are that it frequently updates the mobile ui which can sometimes make it difficult to find what you want, and it doesnt have an alphabetical scroll bar in your library like it used to, which makes it inconvenient and annoying. That being said, these are only minor inconveniences, other than that the app is great."
"The music selection is quite extensive and the sound quality is also, quite good. Trying to work your way round the system can be difficult, for example, setting up playlists using spotify albums, doesn't seem to work. Try adding podcasts, you get the recommended, but how to add your choice, so that they will then be available on the car system."
"Been using Spotify since 2016, started off with basic and quickly subscried for premium for unlimited downloading. Ive been using it pretty consistently every day since then, love it!"
"Love it, this is a great app. Very intuitive and had a huge selection of great music. I especially like the suggestions and playlists they make."
Few good and famous songs are not available. The app is amazingly good and the UI is easy to browse songs. It is a good app for playing music.
One of the best music listening experience for me. App UI is so simple and user friendly. Spotify Team try adding more songs to the appüëç
"Great app, has an occasional glitch where you can't get to your music sometimes but it's rare and may require you to delete and reload app. Still giving it 5 stars."
"been using for a very long time. also on premium ever since but the last update literally ruined my mood. my downloaded albums, playlist won't stop loading until i connect back to the internet. it felt like i need to go online just for the list of downloaded songs to show up."
"Works fine, wish artists were in alphabetical order. Also the freezing when the phone goes to sleep is fixed by opening the app and pressing the little circle pause/play button, this seems to then play without stopping but still, you should not have to do that."
"Amazing music and podcast streaming. Very intuitive interface, useful tools like queue and based radios and a cool way of getting to know new material based on your current interest! I recommend it"
"Good music app. Nice UI, but the thing is, the ads are far too long, like 30 seconds or so and having to go through a long ad just when you're favorite song is about to come up, makes you want to close the app and listen to the song in some other app. If it doesn't bother you like me, you'll really love it!"
"I really like the interface, quite friendly. I only wish it could recommend more playlist with new music, I always end up listening to the same tracks."
"It's amazing iv used it for a few years now. But however a few days ago my SD card started to not keep my songs downloaded and in the ""other"" section where ""storage"" should be. It only shows the log out button. And to get ""storage to pop up I have to take my SD card out then put it back in. Is anyone else having this issue?4"
I like this app a lot. Spotify really is artist oriented. It is an amazing set-up. One of the best go to promo companies is Gilmore Promotions because they deal with all the music vehicles and help to get new campaigns going where the mesh of music with businesses is legendary. This is one of those things where you know youll get good listening always because of whose involved. I discovered Ateam Money Gang Records rap artist LaQuinn using this app and it is because the curator knows my taste.
"This is genuinely a good app. There's some songs I really wanna listen to like ""Wishing Well"" by Juice WRLD but it's not in there. I also suggest there's a exploit filter. It's gonna be a whole lot better with that."
So you should improve the hidden song function so I was listening to the liked song and my play list ended and random songs started to play I like one of the songs but I mistakely press hidden songs button and automaticly it switched to other song I never saw the name of the song properly and never see it again so pls can you make a folder of the hidden song so we can know where to go is we click the hidden song button by a mistake
"I like the app. Not much to complain about, but I accidentally hide one of my favorite songs. I looked up how to unhide, but when I went to do it, the unhide button wasn't there. I just hope it would get fixed."
Awesome. The fact that it can run while I do other things on line at the same time is great. This way my life is in happy mode whole working on line. I am a new customer and I suffer from life's experiences but need music to save me from deep migranes from thinking too hard. I have lived my life listening to music and doing chores all day uplifts me and lightens my load off my shoulders. A tremendous therapy for me to be able to saved upbeat songs to quicken my pace at work is awesome. Thank you
A little tricky trying to navigate through the menus. Not super intuitive but once you figure it out it's good.
"I enjoy the user interface... whether I am searching for new music or choosing something feom a different genre... it is intuitive. I also like the ""My Daily Mix"" provided to me based on my listening selections."
Spotify is The best I only use Spotify and YouTube personally I always love the design and how it is so smooth to find what u want to listen to and the variety of music is awesome because Spotify gives a lot of smaller artist love that other online music streaming services don't.
"Amazing app, I barely have a day where I don't use Spotify. From the UI, to the so personalized playlists, to the high quality sound."
"I'm paying the premium subscription to listen in high quality and without any ads. Now, every now and then an ad pops up for me to acquire a duo plan. I really don't like that."
Has most of what you want to listen to. Can be a bit slow if using it through voice control. Easy to use app though that is quick and informative.
"Overall a very good app with an intuitive design but I think that it could be some what faster on my Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus Exynos 9810. I also think that you should redesign the widget and make us be able to make it smaller or bigger. I believe you should add functions to it as repeat and shuffle and also make it have rounded corners. Well as I said, This app is awesome"
The best you ask and you will always get what you're looking for. I don't care if your 12 or 90 you can hear any song you know. Just talk into the Microphone and like feeling stronger every day. Then the song will play and even give you the Artist. You can download all of that bands song's and store them for offline useage and on line. Build your Library of your favorite songs today and NEVER EVER HAVE TO USE your CD's nor records not The sucking Radio again. Have fun and just sing and dance.
The music choice is very good. I really like how easy and fast their customer service is. They were able to help me with my issue quickly and it's not something that most companies can say. Overall this is a great music platform.
"Use it all the time, so useful, so intuitive and easy to use. Only feature I would want is the ability to select multiple playlists at a time when adding a song to playlists, rather than having to add it to one at a time"
This app is really good but it doesn't have all playlist of many other famous artist that's quite disappointing about this app.....I would like to tell you to reduce some ads it has way to much ads in every half an hour....this app is really good you guys can use it
"I use spotify a couple hours everyday. At this point its my sauce of entertainment, all sorts of playlists I dive into depending on the scene, and as I write this, I'm gonna play a sleep playlist to help me nap. I listen to podcasts on there as well. The Linux desktop App could use some work. Takes a good minute or 2 to load up and start functioning"
Four stars are only because it doesn't support going to the previous track by pressing the headphone button thrice. Please add this support. I really need it!
The app is good it serves its function for which it is built like listening to the music online.It takes its time to understand your liking but once it is there it's playlist are very accurate...n you'll love it within a few days
"Any issues or bugs, which occur very rarely are fixed very quickly. Great feature how they play a playlist based on what you've just recently been playing. Also how they track where bands are playing live. If you love music then premium is worth it. Its 1 maccas meal every month you can go without."
"I think it's the only app that never crosses my mind to delete or cancel. Music is important in life and this app gives me any music from any country, even audio books, pod casts, etc. It's awesome. Very well executed app, I genuinely love it."
"Latest updates have bugs where music pauses randomly and the play/pause button on the android lock screen doesnt work intermittently. Confirmed it is not the data or battery settings. Other reviews here say the same. It wont stop me using spotify since i only listen here and on Triple J, but dammn its annoying!"
"Great song recommendations and easy to understand features. Does what it says on the tin, with an overall good user experience."
It gives good recommendation and I suggest it over other apps. It works on multiplatform But the problem is it gives a lot of ads which ruins the mood that's why I deduct one star
"I love this app but I want to know if it will change the search button on top instead of settings like Spotify web, this is much easier to search song into the playlist."
"Overall Spotify has been a really good app for when I want to listen to music. I would give it five stars but there is something that annoyes me quite alot while using the app. I don't have Spotify premium and whenever I try listen to my playlists I make, it plays one song the goes onto recommend ones and never play another song on my playlist! It's really annoying but apart from that the app is great and my go to music app! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Spotify is amazing, the best music streaming app you can find on any device or platforms, high quality songs, categories, vast music collection anything you need is on Spotify, I'm so glad of it but I hope they change the UI of app, it's a bit old now and add some new customization features for music player me, best of the best 5/5"
"Initially I had issues but after several reboots it works. My favourite feature: block crappy artists. Catalogue can be improved, even though it is already quite big."
"Fell in love with app and thier devs. Really interesting to see how effectively they designed and developed. Reching all corners, seems the perfect example of digital transformation !! Suggestions to add features like - spotify music stories/news/releases , so that users can follow/read - even though premium is there, put albums/songs for sale for less price. So that users can buy and listen forever in your app. - music learning courses (live, if possible) free/payable from popular gurus."
"Playlists need folder ability. sorting UI needs work. There needs to be the option to store playlists in folders for quicker access and sorting. It gets a bit out of hand when you have 50+ playlists on the go and there is aassive need to easily comprehend your own sorting attempts. Please make sorting and adding songs to playlists better. I hate having to retap add to playlist 13 times to add the song I'm listening to, to 2 or more playlists. It's so agonizing. I can't be the only one üòì"
"Difficult to get Spotify to plan on ChromeCast even when done before; button just doesn't show up. A lot of the music I looked for ain't on here (metal, punk, heavy stuff.) Other than that, pretty good."
"I had issues this past week with the app droppin/cutting out so I logged out, had issues logging back in and also with password reset. So, I un/reinstalled app. My email to support was responded to very quickly, they sent the correct link for reset and got me back to my podcast. Thanks Spotify team! Hopefully the app shutting down will come to an end now..."
"Great app, so easy to use and the playlists are awesome! Sometimes it even seems like the app gets my mood when listening to my liked songs on shuffle lol The only issue is when listening to my discover weekly playlist the like/dismiss buttons won't work if im not in the app itself (like on my lock screen, or in my pull down view), it happens also on my iPad (atm I'm using an Android device)."
"Crashes when I try to listen to podcast The app is great but after i upgraded to premium The podcast that I listen to at work won't load. Its specifically Last podcast network podcast who are fulltime spotify exclusive now. Shows like ""wizard and the bruiser"" & ""Abe Lincons top hat"" both crash the app whenever I load the playlist."
"excellent wonderful Perfect I just love SPOTIFY don't know what I would do without it!! so very glad I don't have too!!, Its like Ur own Personal Station to all the Best Music Ever by the voice or push of a button at any time MUSIC Just wanted to add Spotify has a wonderful gift to collaborate the music we listen too, eg. MY 2018 Collaboration of the music I listen too was as though I did it myself WHOM EVER YOU ALL ARE I TRUELY TAKE MY HAT OFF TO YOU ALL, MUSIC IS HEALING Thank you SPOTIFY"
"Great, intuitive and easy to use. Plethora of playlists and music selection. Curated playlists are much longer and diverse than Apple music"
The paid version is a straight 5*s all the way. Some of the features that are locked behind the sub can be quite annoying but make the sub totally worth it too.
Very intuitive. All the features of Spotify on a Mac or desktop. Being able to cast to other devices with that have your Spotify account on them is seem less and feels awesome üëç
"Spotify has a great selection of every genre of music, podcasts, and foreign language lessons. I have Spotify on my phone, tablet, and home and work computers. I love that you can create and download your personal playlists for times you don't have access to the internet, such as during a plane flight. If your car has Bluetooth or an auxiliary patch you can access your playlists and avoid the tedious, inane banter of the disc jockey and endless commercial sets"
"The app is awesome, I love the UI of spotify than the competitor, tho not every songs are in spotify. Overall love the experience using this app."
"To me it is the best app for listening to music. However there is a small bug when connected with a PS4. When you press the button that plays the music in random mode(the two crossed arrows), it shows a completely different song in both the phone screen and the PS4 monitor, that prevents the feature from working properly."
Still absolutely love to use Spotify!! Won't switch to anyone other. No matter what the promotion is. And now I have my husband and 2 sons and my mom and her brother (my uncle) all using Spotify. My uncle really likes it because he is an avid Harley Davidson ridder and enjoys being able to listen to the music that suits him for that particular mood and ride
"It does what it says on the proverbial tin but there are a few songs that, for whatever reason, do not exist and it closes down quite often. I'm giving a four star purely for the fact it closes down more often than I would like."
"I am old enough to recognize this as magic. It's literally awesome to have this much music at my fingertips. It's amazing! So many songs I'd have never otherwise heard. So many obscure albums I've never been able to track down, and they're all right here. And it does an extraordinary job of reccommending new music that suits my tastes. Can't praise it enough. Wholeheartedly encourage you to give it a try."
"I love this app it's awesome! I pay for premium, however I do wish there was a way to quickly add daily mix into a playlist or save particular mixes."
One of the best music application i ever used. I'm 100% sure if you use this app you will delete other music apps. The UI is so easy and clear of this app. All song and artist is in the application. I'm very happy with this application.
"This is definitely the best music app in the world. I am Premium and this is definitely worth it. But what is bad, is that for the free account, you can't do anything. You can't even CHOOSE your song. But beside that, the recommendations algorithm and the features are amazing. Maybe it needs a little UI refresh. It feels old. But again this is still the best music streaming app of the world!"
I love having spotify premium. I'm a delivery driver so I'm always listening to music. If I could give it 4.5 stars I would. Just because they dont have every song available. Like for example the campfire freestyle by juice wrld. I love that song and they dont even have it on there.
Cool and fun to explore new music in this app. You can listen to songs depending on your mood and more. Can listen to podcasts too. But sometimes just stops and disappears and I have to open the app and click play button again which is annoying... Yeah but it's cool other than that.
"We subscribe, and it's a nice system for listening to the stuff I like. Docked one star because of ""rating system"". There should be more than a like and a never button. I want the program to know what I ""like"" without it being placed in my favorites"
Ok before I update it it was amazing I can shuffle my playlist a I want and I enjoyed it. After the update i hate it i can't anymore and i can't even pause my music on my lock screen. And I'm a paid member i feel like I'm being treated as I'm not a paid member. I have to have my music and I enjoy spofity a lot. But please fix what i said and bring back that shuffle button. Until then I'm leaving this as a 2 star. Edit: ok they fix everything I'm happy I continue to love this app
"(Premium user) Exceptional app for listening to music, the quality is remarkable, and the variety is surprisingly big. However, there are some playing issues with the shuffle button, the driving mode results somewhat troublesome in order to find a particular song, and sometimes the tracks stop randomly at certain points."
"It was fine earlier, but recently when I'm doing stuff on my phone and spotify is running in the background it sometimes stops and it shows that it's playing, but it isn't. So, you have to press the play button, which will reset the song and when you go into the app itself, it shows it is at zero and you have to listen to the song again if you don't have premium or any skips left. So, I hope this will be fixed."
Fantastic site by far the best music app of all by far one thing I would do it give the end user the opportunity to purchase a single or a album directly through the app with spotify currency which we acquire through the same method in which subscription is paid allowing us to put the music on other devices eg. MP3 or flash drive. Allowing spotify to over take Google music and Apple music. Also allow a comment option for us to interact with favorite artists. Hope management see's this post.
"New: I listen to podcasts a lot, why can't I rate them on Spotify interface? As often asked by the person casting. Also, how do I find podcasts that I 'follow' again? It's not intuitive. Old: Thanks for all thr new podcast integration in new releaseüòÅ üëç Older: I use Spotify a lot but have some issues. Why aren't podcasts integrated properly into the app? The downloaded episodes are 'hidden' in the interface. The app should prioritise podcasts 'for me' in all views as i use them a lot."
"Its a good music searching app. But there aint some songs available on spotify that I find on some other app. And can we have an option or a button sort of to disable vulgar words because some songs may have vulgar words no doubt but some people wont like hearing the lyrics but they like the music produced. If spotify can fix this, then I'll rate it 5 stars"
Have been using Spotify for quite awhile now just one problem with it in the recent update now it pauses the song randomly when you finish a playlist instead of repeating the playlist or playing other songs related to your liked but that's it
"I have tried almost all of the popular music streaming services and Spotify is by far the best one with streaming quality, UI, and personalization."
Amazing app you can listen to pretty much everything you want but I really hate that when it says you get a half-hour of uninterrupted listening ten muinets later you gey another add other than that it rocks you can even make youre own personal playlists
The app is quite useful as it helps to be able to listen to songs even while using some other app. A lot of variety of songs are also available.
"My phone is samsung s7 edge, i know its quite old but i still get dissapoined when sometimes i dont see ""instagram stories"" choice to share my song even when my ig and spotify has been updated, i need to re-open the app times to get the option show up"
I'm liking the selection and doesn't quit on me 10 seconds before the end of every song like another music app does to me. Keeps me entertained with minimal interruptions.
"The app not only has your favorite music, but even makes you find and explore new music!! The design of this app is incredible too!! I've loved the app from the beginning"
"YALL ACTUALLY LISTENED TO MY PREVIOUS REVIEW ON UI ACCESSIBILITY, S/O to the development team! It's much easier to notice the songs in the playlist, thank you."
The sound quality of music is wonderful with it's overall features of graphics in spotify is extremely invaluable for an end-user to listen any likeable genre of music.
The interface and presentation of app is quite impressive. I've became a huge fan of it. The connectivity of app with various devices is amazing.
"Greatest streaming app for music ever! All my favourite artists, albums and tracks under the same roof, good stuff! There's one complaint I have with the app, why isn't a search bar for every playlist and liked songs like it is on iOS app? I find it stupid and useless extra steps to find a track. You have to select options button, go to Find and then search. A top bar will make this way more fast and natural!"
"I love Spotify, I think its a great music streaming service that particularly impresses me with its ability to handle bad network connections. Of course better Linux support (particularly for Wayland) is always appreciated, but I can understand that this isn't exactly a priority for the development team ;)"
"It's a good app. You can find the songs you like. The one negative I've found is that you can't download the music into a flashdrive. The download button sends the music to I cloud, therefore you can't listen to it on another player."
"It was really good till this latest update. Everytime I press shuffle, it plays the first song on my list, and the button than says ""pause"" instead of shuffle. Why aren't the songs shuffling?"
"Tons of selection, easy to use, intuitive options, and creative discovery playlists. You can't go wrong with Spotify."
I love it. Nothing more to say. Impressed by their recommendation and eye catching UI. Please include an optional lyrics feature too...
"Great music and access to insane amounts of content from top artists, all that luxury of premium for a great price! - Especially if you're a student only about $4.99 a month for Spotify, Hulu and Showtime Student Bundle ;)"
Perfect but i wish there was a feature where i could make a playlist with a friend that would have all the music we listen to in common. I also would like it if editing playlist was easier and if the queue button wasnt so close to the delete from playlist button.
"My only complaint is that y'all don't have every song in existence, but I don't that's (entirely) y'all's fault. I'm assuming it's up to the artist whether they want their song (or specific ones) on there, or for legal reasons (-slash- requirements that have to be met) it can't be on there. Like the song 'Milk Carton' by Usher. That song is a mother frickin banger.üé§üé∂üëåüèª‚úäüèª I wish it was on Spotify."
"I love this app. It has everything i want here. The music plays very smoothly and there are no ads or anything that is annoying. Despite everything, there is something i dont like: the premium. I understand that yall want money and stuff but like some of us cant afford it. That is quite annoying cuz they r very biars to their premium users. If u dun hv premium, you can only skip a few songs and you cannot choose the song you want to play. Plus, the premium is very expensive."
"I love this streaming music app. The user interface is great and intuitive. The playlists that come up are much more appealing than what Google Play music recommends. I like that I can use Spotify on my LG TV as well with lyrics if you want to sing a long. Unless Google fixes their family plan before the subscription runs out, I might just make the switch to Spotify's family plan."
"Nice use of available devices, tv, etc Makes the experience easily portable. Nice to be able to play full albums, a must for old geezers like me. On that subject, some albums and songs are missing, like DEVO's ""Oh no, it's ..."" and songs like Knock Boots by the same group. Fix that and I'll give it 5 stars score. Also, as opposed to the desktop app, the mobile version UX leaves a lot to be desired (hearted an unheated icons are the same, c'mon) plus it forces you to listen to albums in shuffle?"
Brilliant to find any music anytime to suit your mood at any particular time or reason. So much easier to have everything at your fingertips than searching through piles of CD's! I love Spotify
"Spotify is just the coolest thing ever! There are plenty of entertainment options, the design is visually and mechanically impeccable, the sound quality is superb, and the sharing features are amazing! I have loved Spotify for many years! Spotify is a paragon of music apps and one of the absolute best entertainment apps available. Two thumbs up! Definitely... DEFINITELY bruh..."
"The Overall UI experience is great, specially when all the UI is in dark theme. It is very useful as I listen to music at night. The only problem is that there is only a limited amount of music present based on regions."
"Spotify is great. The app is great. My only issue is that it often downloads the same songs I've already downloaded and it's quite frustrating. You would assume once it's downloaded, its there for good, but that's not the case. Please look into that. Otherwise, great app."
"Good app but still a few recurring bugs: - When switching wifi > 4g, there's a quite long period when the app is ""offline"" (other app such as browser can access network properly) - Since latest update the widget isn't loading (android 10, Nova launcher)"
App UI is good. Sound quality is good. I have reduced 1 star star for increased ads and some missing songs. Please update the songs.
"My best app on the phone. It's flawless, reliable and quick. I am in love with Spotify - I use it every day. I highly recommend. They have such an amazing product. I use premium and it worths every penny."
"Out of the hundreds (probably thousands) of songs that I've listened to with this app, I've maybe only not found 2 songs that I was looking for. I use this app every day and definitely reccomend for people to get premium. Playlist making is pretty intuitive, and sharing spotify playlists is easy."
Cuts out sometimes to connect to my airpods when connected to my Jeep. But a quick disconnect and reconnect gets it working again. Only complaint that I have otherwise it would be 5 stars.
"Good UI and individual song control. Can use a channel page for playlist creators. Btw I don't hate ads, but three in a streak are annoying."
Love Spotify except for the hide button in the notification shade control screen. It's the worst and was very difficult to unhide the song afterwards. Hope you fix/remove it.
"Good music app. Wish it had a ""dislike"" button to get rid of songs from reappearing on your suggestions. Otherwise, use it everyday and love it"
"I love Spotify. I enjoy how personalized it is. I think the time capsules and yearly rewinds are really good. Also, the interface itself is very well designed."
Overall a great app but this most recent update seems to have made it so if I open up anything that plays a video or sound instead of pausing my music it quits out of the app entirely.
"It's great but could be better. It's the best music streaming available though, I've tried quite a few different ones but always come back to Spotify! I've had the premium for about a year now but lately it's started doing this weird thing where I'm out somewhere and my playlist that had been downloaded doesn't play and suddenly says it's downloading again. It never used to do that. Also I so hope we could get the Spotify kids in the UK, it launched in Ireland already do when do we get it??"
This is a great app i use it all the time. But i am done with the same spotify premuiem ads. I dont have the money to do that every month but i really just want to listen to my music without 5 spotify premuiem ads after every 3 songs.
"Look, I don't often leave reviews but in the absence of being able to find an easier way to express my displeasure at hiding the repeat/shuffle buttons, I'm leaving this in the hope they'll be brought back to the Now Playing screen. You're a music player; don't make it harder to play music."
"great app I don't listen to the new music but if you like Classic Soul,Rock or Pop it's on spotify also Jazz lovers spotify has it all I Spend hours listening to Miles Davis or more modern artist like Fourplay,Pat Matheny and the late George Duke, you can't beat the price and the audio Quality is Adjustable to suit your streaming limitations. Last thing on the good to know list about spotify it works great with Alexa from Amazon flawlessly for me so far."
"Essential app, but still unstable. Works fantastically right up until it crashes. Quick load time, though. Probably your best bet right now."
"Love it alot BUT really wish I could have the old format back... today ruined the way I made playlist and dated them/ named them based on what I was doing, sorta like a music journal..I can't even see how many songs are in the playlist I made easily, butter either way... loveeee it"
The ux for adding currently playing track to a playlist is very bad. Its hard to touch 3dots button then add to playlist especially in large screen phones.
"Quite good, no complaints albeit not having a certain sticky fingers song on there, but y'all need a feature inwhich geolocates artists nearby so you can follow and find all the local and up and coming artists! Also, if you could sort playlists by genre that would be absolutely unreal!"
"I Have Tried Different Music Apps, Even The Original App On My Huawei, Spotify Beats Em All. EASY To Use, Quick Downloads, Beautiful Set Up And An Amazing Auto Suggestion Feature When Creating New Playlist. It Can Acurately Guess What Songs You Would Like In Your Newly Created Playlist. Amazing Offline & Online. Auto Downloads As Soon As You Get Unto A WiFi Network. Keeps Your Music Updated Constantly For Offline Listening."
"It is a good app I almost got every songs I searched for, but the advertisement comes quite often which I didn't really found good in this . Others may not have problems with this advertise but when we are not in a good mood and just want to listen songs without any disturbance, the advertise sounds really annoying though I don't have premium account."
"Simply awesome. Ability to auto-add liked songs to ""liked"" playlist is a great functionality & easy way for listeners to build their arsenal of favorite music..."
"Build a playlist of songs you want to hear. There are also pre made song lists that are based off of artist you like. Discover new artists with their discover playlists. Pause, rewind, like, and dislike."
This is the best app to listen to music. Sometimes i would listening to my music and then an ad interupts it. Thats the only i hate and i dont have the mony to get spotify premuim.
"One of the best music app source out their. And yes there are advertisements to as well often.but it doesn't show the whole album of songs on it like you want it too, to know that its suppose to be playing all the required songs on the album."
"Can't open menu for songs (the 3 dots in the top right), everytime I try the whole app freezes and crashes. This means I can't add songs to playlists, share songs, etc. I've used spotify premium for years now and do enjoy it, but this bug is making it quite difficult to do much on the app. If this gets fixed I'll change my review to a 5 star."
"It works fine on my Android in general but somehow I was not able to use the Chromecast feature. Whenever I choose the ""Devices Available"" button, it only directs me to a page where I can see a selection of devices that I can connect to. When I chose ""Chromecast"", all it does is pop up an instructions window. I have made sure that both are connected to the same network."
"I'm very thankful for having free premium for thru sbux. The discover weekly is very awesome. I just really, really wish you can look up your history. Bc I'm left with feeling stupid for not liking or screenshot a very good week's playlist. Like seriously make this happen. Plzz"
"This is simply the best app for streaming music all over the world! Simple to use, many features, cool design and nice download and storage technology for offline songs and Playlists! And the Abo price is really acceptable üòä So 10/10 recommended!"
"Other than the live music share feature needing more functionality, this app is amazing with a great range of music and podcasts with a simple design."
"Love the different tunes which go on daily, and the mixer of music is a lot different from other sites and music apps. Ive had this app for quite a while now and i wouldn't change it at all, and if you go premium you get complete AD free. So thats ecen better also saving your music to yoyr own playlist to listen to later couldn't be any easier."
"UI a little confusing, but it just works, always, flawlessly. Music selection is unparalleled, audio quality excellent and resilience to poor signal or flaky coverage is amazing."
"Great app that has the largest library of songs that has its own classifications for your different tastes in music. Also, the music algorithm is calculated to suit your needs."
It's a great app and provides most of the songs...few songs are not there but during the play if the music there is no later and required very own data...
"EDIT : MY ONLY NIGGLE IS IF U PAY 4 THE PRIVILEGE, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO D/LOAD & KEEP IT 4 OFFLINE & ALWAYS. IF YOU DECIDE TO CANCEL YOU STILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP YR PLAYLISTS INSTEAD OF LOSING EVERYTHING. I think Spotify is awesome, having all that music, podcasts etc at the click of a button & for free aswell. . . I still L‚ô°VE YOU SPOTIFY. ‚ù£‚ù£ üòäüëç‚ù£‚ù£"
"Just got worse, first of all let me say that I loved the old player design so much, apart from being subjective there are some major button swapping/relocation which I believe breaks the habit of users, menu button is now on top which I personally used a lot and which is now hard to reach also it does not feel premium now, feels dibalanced. I hope this review is helpful for spotify and they do something about it."
Some songs are not explicit but appears as explicit. Quite sad that not many songs from a particular singer is available either due to the songs being explicit reported by users.
"Kind of sucks without premium. The free version is on par with Pandora premium and the premium version is like a tech advance we should have waited ten instead of two years for. I'm all for instant gratification and what I want to hear when I want it but the library itself is worth using the web app for, but not quite worth paying the full asking price."
Been a pro sub for many years now quite easy to navigate and is good if you have a family account wide variety of songs and quite easy to set up playlist only draw back is that if you want to delete playlists you won't know what songs your deleted unless you like every single one.
"I love the app. Organizing my music is nice, however the last couple days my music has been cutting out when my screen is locked. I'm not sure if there was an update or if anyone else is experiencing the same issue but its quite irritating."
Using the UI is very intuitive. Songs are way easy to find. There are numerous playlist that are well conceived.
Everything's all right but I guess you could improve those visuals and layout designs? Otherwise I love this app as it gives me the daily dose of free good quality music streaming!
I enjoy how this music flows over me. I'd like the user interface design. Especially I like about the marketing strategy that always reminds user to switch to premium. I hope there's a better development day by day.
"It's good and all, but it sometime loads forever, I don't know why. And sometimes music stops playing, but it shows as it is still playing, it's very weird. Last thing especially happens when songs are being downloaded. P.S. I'm living in Russia btw. And Spotify on Linux (or Windows) works way smoother and snappier."
"Love the app, I use it all the time. However i dislike that I have to go through a menu to find the ""search playlist"" function. Please put the search bar back on top of the playlist (right below shuffle button). This is the only reason I'm giving the app four stars instead of five."
"Love the app. It has only one problem. When I'm searching, sometimes I see musics which I have already liked them before, but the like button is off. And when I hit it and search the music in liked musics playlist, I see two of the same song."
I can't say enough about Spotify. It is truly the best service out there. From playlist to music design specially for you. Spotify is the best!
"I'm not sure which genius thought it was a good idea to remove the search function from Liked Songs and put it into the main playlist folder, but it no longer let's me search for any songs, meaning I have to trawl through all my songs if I'm offline. Please fix this, its been an issue for at least 6 months now and is a UX nightmare."
"It's the best that's all i can say. Best Audio Quality , best song recommendations. It makes me updated and feels home to use it. Maybe it needs some UI and theme changes , but it deserve a 5 star"
Excellent music & podcast catalog. Spotify always care about my preferences with customized playlists and the personalized anual and decade review are awesome. Excellent user experience. Keep it up spotify
"Great quality music, big selection. Should have been a 5 star review, but the music gets louder when I open an application and quieter when it's just playing music."
"Been a Spotify customer for quite sometime now and it's a great platform for music lovers... However it's not perfect. I feel that the EQ function should be available across all platforms (PC, android, ios etc etc). Daily playlists, even though fairly accurate can be quite predictable and very samey. Other than the things stated I enjoy using the app! Thanks Spotify."
"Nice experience. But the color of the control button on the notification bar changes with the background image. It's interesting, but sometimes its merely visible. So its better to give a user friendly color, white would be appropriate..."
"In terms of UI and UX, this is one of the best music player i have encountered. Also, playback support is awesome. Keep it up!"
"I have been using this app for years. I have never even switched to another music app because this app works so smoothly and well. I do have a family plan with premuim, but overall, this is one of my favorite apps on my phone."
I love this app so much. I can to listen to most songs I want to. I do wish i could have unlimited skips without going to premuiam. Its so much easier to find a song.
"I love the app, easy to use to a point the odd updates cause slight confusion... Use to be able to ""remove song"" now everything's based on the üíì Like button... So I'm unsure if it deletes off my account or not, and the current issue is when downloading, the song count will freeze at a number and the songs will stop downloading now ""waiting to download"" resulting in re-installing app to fix. Still love and use it, this new issue is just tad annoying. So many bands I'm trying to add but cant."
"I had iHeart for quiet some time and I hated, tried Pandora couldn't get used to the way it worked. I got Spotify premium as a gift from Microsoft and they now have me hooked. Won't go back to any other music app. Highly recommend."
"Spotify is a good way to explore different music genres,it is quite easy to find songs and recommends things you like! I really enjoyed using Spotify and I even might get premium!!!"
"The greatest music/podcast platform. So easy to load and play your favorites right away. Loved the Dirty John podcast, found many more fun stories, Dramas, Mysteries. Discovered Kev Rowe acoustic guitar touched a hurting part of me to encourage healing. Try it you'll love it!"
"app is amazing but there a few things i wish were added to the android version. it would be cool if we were given a button option that says ""remove from playlist"" on each song instead of having to look up the song, bring up the option menu and remove it. also, it would be cool if we had the option to edit the playlists description on android. the app is good like i said but it could be so much more customizable therefore more fun to use!"
It's a pretty amazing place. Nearly limitless supply of music accompanied by a good UI and tons of features to make listening to music and finding new pieces a fun experience. I Definitely recommend this for anyone that enjoys music.
"Whilst they should have a discount for high school students as well, Spotify is a pretty amazing app. Their entire music library has just about anything you are looking for and more. Though it would be cool if it had a built-in Shazam/song identifier."
Only reason I didn't award a 5 star rating is because lots of playlists have missing songs. I do use the app quite often and find it very convenient for varied listening. Not bad at all!
So good so far but if you add this feature the app will become 7 stars app: in the notification bar you have the song slider to return it back and also a button to return 5 seconds and you can cutomize those features in the app
"Wide library, excellent quality, the UX on mobile is a bit strange but you can get used to it. Spotify Connect is a godsend that I use more than I could think of. Great price and optional drops for eligible users so that's a bonus (even though I think they should do it on more countries). All in all a great experience"
"Steps away from perfect. Spotify has the best interface among all of its competitors and its an amazing service. But, the only thing that I don't like about Spotify is that they differentiate between Android and Ios in terms of UI and overall stability. I have an iPad and spotify has a much better experience on it than on my Android device. Also, there should be an option to remove downloaded songs from a particular Playlist."
"excellent selection of music and great user experience couldn't recommend it any higher, this is coming from my previous Apple music and Google play music subscriber. Just get Spotify, it's worth it!"
"Great app, but the lack of a power button made me delete once, hope it's fixed soon as I dont want another app being left on in the back ground. But, as a music app, you cant do any better, and I tried them all."
Only problem with Spotify is the fact that there are many other music apps that dont require you to pay for a membership in order to download songs for offline use and have no ads.
"Pretty good - works fine, has everything I want, easy to use. Only criticisms are the search mechanism is a bit shonky and it's easy to hit the wrong button by mistake and stop the track you're listening to. But maybe that's my sausage fingers. I'd give it 5 stars if it was free, but it's not."
Can you add a dedicated button to add the song to a playlist please? And not having to click on the dots and then on the option to add the song to a playlist. Deezer has this option and it is a lifesaver when driving and not only when driving. Thanks.
Much better. Still disappointed with the missing songs. But not disappointed enough to leave the platform. Just going to keep fingers crossed and hope the lawsuits blow over.
"I have never had such an extensive repetoire of music immediately available to me and I will not even go into the smoothness of the layout and interface. The design is elegant and intuitive, there is very little Spotify could do to ruin this experience but I'll not tempt you."
The best thing about the app is the inbuilt software and it's interface. It automatically (~97%) displays the next song according to your present song selection and your mood. Loving this app
"Nice app use it all the time. Great podcasts and songs to listen to at like anytime. All types of genres and things to listen to 10/10 would recommend. However, ads are quite annoying but you can remove them with premium but you can still listen the ads are just really annoying."
"Ok I have been using the app for quite a while and have had a pretty good experience with Spotify. However, I just wish it would work in all network connectivity conditions. Please work on this. üôÇ"
"I love that you can look up any song and add it to ur playlist. And when you search for a song in specific, it'll play it twice and move on to a playlist that suites that song. My playlist? 3000+ and counting."
"Very good and user friendly, love to bits. I can recommend it to a friend. On the move and anyway else, you get it. New,old, classics, hip-hop,rave, rock'n'roll, house music , you get it all. in ordinary rating, I would give Spotify, out of a hundred,( a massive one hundred and a fifty). Ask those with the know how, they will upgrade your naive mind quickly. As for the ignorant, they are missing the bus to Milwaukee, so catch it while still early..I've got some friends that just changed, love it"
I love the sound quality and the ease of use. It is very intuitive and has a friendly way of assisting me with downloading songs I enjoy. Thanks for my new friend. Jack
"Best music app out there; gives the best suggestions for similar songs in a playlist, smooth user interface, and awesome design overall. Highly recommend for all music lovers."
"Great overall (Have Premium), I've used Amazon music, apple music, I heart radio, pandora, and Google music but I prefer the UI and music recommendations fron Spotify. I also really enjoy when they do end of year recaps and create other playlists for me. Highly recommend."
"Great Music selection 5 out of 5. HOWEVER the user interface needs work. Shuffle features are mediocre at best. From Spotifys own community forum, they don't seem to reach out or have real solutions to customers complaints or concerns about the user experience. That's really ashame considering that this is a paid service. That is why I had to deduct a star *"
It is one of the best music streaming apps (if not the best right now). Though four stars are just because it's been a while and you guys have still not added a lot of tracks from some renowned artists which should have been added quite a long time back .And it still says 'we are trying hard to bring music to your region ' and it's quite disheartening to see that message still.
"I am grateful that for a small monthly fee but no fixed contract you can get a whole genre of music suited to the individuals need. I was surprised at the range of music as I am a music lover, and believe in a Good Range of music aswel as of Good Quality is needed for a Positive Mind. In the past I have had Vinyl, Cassette, CD, Minidisc, RW/R, But who can carry their whole music media collection with them? Welldone Spotify! It would be great to allow users to change the colours of the display."
"It's great. Has a great UI which makes it easy for me to find my playlists, favorite songs, etc. but I do have one problem: Whenever I use spotify, it's always guaranteed to crash at some point while I'm listening to music. It's annoying at times."
"It's a great app, easy to use with lots of great functionality and love the personal mixes. App stops mid song quite frequently- very annoying otherwise I'd give it a fiver!"
"The best music app out with premium. (I've tried apple music) More of my friends have spotify so we can easily share new music. Good UI, convenient and you can safely use while driving."
"Well, this is the ultimate streaming experience.. the UI is fluid and pleasant.. even if you use another music app for sometime, you will eventually come back as Spotify is simply phenomenal.."
"What I like: virtually ever song I could possibly think of is available, easy-to-use interface, playlist and library features a few different ways to sort songs. - - - What could be improved: Song search function for all playlists and not just for Liked songs. Large playlists do take quite a bit of scrolling!"
Quite simply the best music streaming app out there. I hope Spotify takes over the world. Great for the independent musician too. Never change; we love you.
"What Would My Life Be Without You? I honestly love Spotify so much. I have had it since the beginning and remember coming across it. I had to switch to Premium because I found myself craving the freedom to listen to Playlists I have made, WHENEVER. The music and podcast selection is excellent. It has never failed me, and I genuinely don't know what I would do without it. The sound is good. I like that you can follow your favourite Artists. I just love it."
"All I can say is, it is a great app. Although it has a lot of room to grow and adapt more settings and options related to music technology. Also something should be done about payments. For example my bank card require 3D security and I had to use another card to pay for my subscription."
"Spotify is a great app for music, however it does required certain fee each month if u want premium features. I think this is fine but not for me personally. One thing I dislike about is ads, but in the end of the day, I enjoy Spotify and had got used to the ads."
Easy to install. Very intuitive interface. Easy to find songs. Considering switching to premium.
I love you spotify and I want to take this relationship to the next level. So let me see that discography and let's make a playlist. But seriously spotify is a great app with premuim. Spread the sound and support their platform.
"Great web interface with a neat design that's easily navigable. Music selection can be a tad more limited than on other platforms, but there's still a decent variety of music from different artistes for the choosing. Not a bad app wholly. Worth the download."
"There are more or less all artists on Spotify, yet there are some international artists like Alec Benjamin, Coldplay, etc. that I am not able to find. I hope you're able to widen the song collection in Spotify India. All in all, I absolutely love the UI and the experience. This app made me fall in love with music, again."
"I dont the layout and the lack of control of your liked songs. When I started I had trouble differentiating between downloaded, liked, and following. Gets too complicated. WITH THAT BEING SAID, I love Spotify premium and the value is amazing. I'm yet to not find a song on here even from my childhood. Podcast are a cool addition, I would like to see better videos or graphics pkaying while a song plays. Flipping between the same 5 photos is kinda lame. Equalizer ü§ô cool beans. 3.5 stars totalforme"
I just recently gotten spotify premium and since then the app has been glitching quite badly. I've made plently of room on my divice and SD card to download music and it's just not doing it. Please fix this or at least tell me of a way to it. I love the app and I NEED my music.
I was offered a free music service by my wireless carrier and took a break from Spotify. I'm back to Spotify now. It's so intuitive and easy to use. I enjoy the podcasts too. Even transferring my Spotify lists and songs didn't make the other music app better.
"While the app is great and the music acceptable, there is NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT!! The website runs you round and round to avoid giving you support and then unloads you into the ""community"" pages. I'm having security issues in my account but I can't reach anyone at Spotify! Epic fail. UPDATE: Much higher rating. Once I *did* actually manage to reach customer support (by accident almost), they were extremely helpful and responsive. Got the issue resolved extremely quickly. Thank you Jenniebee"
Sometimes it doesn't load as quick as it should and it messes up with the experience. The service is great but the app has its problems.
Way to many ads but still a pretty good place to stream music and podcast. I find myself using spotify quite often. I was going to give it 4 starts but I just rembered spotify finally made it so you can add the same song mutiple times to the same playlist. Youtube should take a good look at spotify and let you add the same video mutiple times to the same playlist to
Dude. Hands down the best. Screw all the other music apps. Spotify 1000% genuinely cares about their listeners. Everything is so personalized and they even give you new artists/songs to check out based on your listening weekly. In a perfect world everyone would be on Spotify.
"... Everyday they give you a list of ppl of personally suited playlists to choose from, depending on your preferred music genres and artists!! I also love the Spotify app, because it allows for the use of multiple screens at one time, making it easier for completing work related tasks, or just chillin gaming 'n still kickin it üé∂ to the beats! Thanx guys! üëå ~ Bonnie Lynn"
"RE: Ongoing opportunities for the beautification of Spotafizle Dear Spotify team, Please fix the bug where the pause button doesn't work on the lockscreen (Samsung Galaxy A5) it pauses for a millisecond and then resumes playing. Please make it possible to back-track a song on a playlist from the first song in my playlist. (i.e.: If: I back-track on the first song on my playlist, Then: play the last song in my playlist. <3"
"Affordable, hardly ever crashes desipe how many people use Spotify, easy and quick to download and look up music. Highly recommend."
"Super simple UI, high quality playback. Some occasional buffering issues but other than that it's been great for the 5 years I've used spotify."
"I absolutely love Spotify, it's cool, I'll listen to a few artist or songs and next thing you know the wonderful people at spotify build a bunch of play lists for me, it's like having a built in DJ in my phone. Thanks Spotify, best music app there is."
"Can anyone help me get Spotify to recognize my SD card? Followed a lot of guides on the internet but to no avail. Tried moving the cache folder, reinstalling the app, etc. but the option to choose where to download songs under the storage tab still doesnt pop up for me"
"Good overall experience. Sometimes it has connectivity issues with Google homes and streaming over multiple Google home speakers. Also downloaded songs still require data unless you turn on offline mode, should be a no-brainer, but it still does it."
Just switched from Pandora about an hour ago and after transferring all my playlists I'm way happier with this already. UI is much cleaner and simpler to use plus the music selection is way better with more uncensored music. Pandora has been replacing songs with the clean versions even in your thumbs up.
"Okay, so, so far, up to this point, spotify has been amazing. But now all of a sudden, I can't get into my account. Usually, when I opened spotify, it would go straight to the main page without me needing to log in. But now, when I open spotify, it requires me to log in, but I forgot my password and my username, and when I type in my email address to get my password, it says it's invalid. Please help me with this."
I've had this app for years and it has never given me any issues. I love how I can just hear a song on the radio and go look it up on spotify and find the album and artist and others that I completely forgot about. Or I can just pick something recommended to suit my mood best app to me. I wish it did show lyrics although I mainly use the free version
"Always find something good to listen to. Music, podcasts- very good selection. And good user experience with the app."
Wish you didn't have it automatically shuffling the songs when we play it and quit playing songs that aren't part of the album. I actually like to listen to the songs in order.
"Obviously the best music app, but sometimes it tells me I'm offline when I'm not, and sometimes I have problems linking my desktop spotify to my phone's Spotify. Could definitely be more intuitive"
"Brilliant as long as you have Spotify premium membership, but it's worth the money. Spotify recommends songs with complete accuracy, and I have discovered some of my favourite artists through Spotify. Its user interface is incredibly simple with premium, although it is quite difficult to navigate the app without premium. Spotify does its absolute best to make your life easier with discovering and listening to music and even navigating music in your car is a breeze with their car view mode. 5/5."
"Spotify is better than Apple music, that's what they want you to hear at least. I don't have that many characters here but believe you me when I say Spotify is leading the music streaming industry, upheld mainly by their UI, which is easy to use and has a way of suggesting songs that I like."
"Great app! I enjoy listening to music whatever, whenever, wherever I want! specially if you will avail premium account, it's worth what you pay even if its only for 3 months for only 150 pesos. I will definitely avail again the premium account once it ends up. Highly recommended app. I enjoy my work as a home based graphic designer while listening to Spotify with my favorite songs that I want to play. name it and it is all available in a search engine if you avail premium account. thumbs-up!"
The only complaint I have with Spotify is they have limited old bollywood movie songs. This makes me jump to YouTube but I don't like YouTube music because of their UI. Otherwise best music app.
"I appreciate the amount of ways you can sort and edit playlists and the amount of songs. However, I think the UI on Xbox can be greatly improved"
"After first time I used Spotify I never wanted to use anything else. AI algorythms are brilliant, the app has obviously undergone a proper UI/UIX research, and even the absence of some (very little) amount of songs doesn't spoil it. At home, in the car, in a trip, on a walk -- it is simply perfect."
"Love it so far , wish there was a button or something when it asks you watch this video to get 30 mins of free non ad that you check it and it auto plays the ad video so you don't have to click it."
"I love Spotify! I don't know what i would do with out them. Somethings I wish they'd add: light theme, lyrics, and idk really just a better ui. But anyways it's still a super awesome app."
my favorite music app. however its crashing after a few songs when I'm playing music and it's quite annoying. have to reopen and press play.
The app is great and comes with great genres of music .The daily mix feature is also great and fabulous.The app design seems to have much materialistic design which is great and the detailings in the app doesn't look puny.
I love the collection of songs and overall use is good too..one of the best feature(though small) was able to control the volume within the app since i prefer a minimal use of the physical buttons..
"Great selection of music best I've seen and ease of use is exceptional. Recommends songs that are awesome helps build my playlist, offline capability is all the difference"
"Plus: Good quality audio, Minimalist dark design, Easy to access for premium user, Can add local music. For the Minus: Accessibility for free user are bad, Free user always anoyed by advertisement, Can't add local music on the phone, There is no selection for theme because i think not everyone like dark theme, High price for people that want to get premium."
Spotify as a streaming music app simply works. The latest changes to viewing your playlists makes it really difficult to listen to songs and only displays a preview soundbite on mobile. I enjoyed the UI when you could sort and filter but the FAQs haven't been updated since September to reflect these changes.
Free version is ok but the paid for service is very good. Huge selection of music and the app is intuitive to use.
"Spotify has a large variety of songs. Is there a way to add songs from outside the site? Without having to upload them? The only other feature that needs improvement on the phone and pc, is the ""add to playlist"" function? Perhaps make it an easy button to press like the ""likes song"" and ""shuffle? I recommend the student discount."
Looks like I am experiencing the same as others. I thought it was me hitting buttons by mistake. But yes it keeps stopping when it wants. Only happens when I'm on the road. And the one person who is going to say that's why. I live in a huge city. To find a dead spot is almost impossible these days.
"It's great, I have a premium account, but lately every time I try to press the options to a song or album or anything, the app freezes and I have to reboot my phone. Can't go to an artist from a song, or share a playlist, or anything that involves any option button."
I love Spotify. We are premium. Good customer service with quick response. All music choices. I can't live without Spotify premium.
I loved my premium Spotify until it kept stopping and nothing helped. I'm back to free listening. I'm not quite sure which is worse. I need music therefore I am going to try other apps. I'll keep checking back to see if anything is going well again... I'm back.
"The app is great, way cheaper if you get your family to join you on the family plan. They build customized playlists at the end of each year which are usually really good."
Provides a great user experience and a vast genre of music (special mention for EDM's). It would be great if we can tap & hold to move a song up/down in our playlists permanently.
"Really good playback, clear audio, easy to use. Great way to listen to music and a quick way to click on songs! üòä"
"Overall the best app for music, however not being able to see the number of songs on a playlist is quite irritating. Will this be brought back ever?"
"Excellent selection, fabulously easy to use. Fast results, completely ingenious functions and tools to use to get to the music that suits the moment or project you need. Enjoy!"
"My experience with the app is delightful so far, and perfectly suits my needs. My one caveat with the service is some underground or specific bands that I really like is not available or not in this service (for instance, I really like the metal band Demetori but they aren't here). I guess it depends with the bands' publishers."
Think price is a little bit high So I settle with free with ads but sometimes there to repetitive but for a tenner is rather have adds 5 99 would be a more suitable price since we could all be downloading our music free but choose to use this app
"I have experienced unexpected stops when I'm listening to music and when I listen to music and pause it and leave it there the thing on the notification box that helps you have excess to skipping and pausing quickly,shuts off and I have to go back to the app to listen to my music.Please improve your app."
"Intuitive to use. Great selection. Just wish thete were an option when listening to a playlist, to delete a song from your list and library."
"Sometimes the application gets confused about whether I'm connected to the internet and I have to force close it and open it again, but aside from that I've had a very pleasant user experience."
"Song database's quite complete, most of my musics are there. Playlist recommendation also very helpful. Just lack of lyrics. should has lyrics so we can sing a song if we don't remember the lyrics"
"I subscribed immediately! The best collection of music I love, beautiful mixes and playlists personaly designed based on my choice, clear sound - perfectly balanced for each song. Love it more than any other music app. Thank you for creating such app and filling my day with music‚ù§ Love this app more every day - all the music which I love, all music which I shall listen. Thank you Spotify Team for rising love vibesüòç"
AMAZING customer support! When my account got accessed by an unauthorized user they were able to recover my playlists AND helped refund the charges. They were quick to respond and so good about working out the issues. The only way I survive my long commute is spotify downloads so I am happy to continue using this app.
"I have always been in love with Spotify even before it launched here in India. The playlists, the UI, the sheer experience of using it and the added perks of being a Premium member makes it unparalleled. Just hope that the issue with Warner Bros is resolved in the near future so that all the songs get available once again. Regardless, Spotify, I love you ‚ù£Ô∏è"
I've been with Spotify for about 5 years now ever since Pandora didn't quite satisfy my need for music. I signed up and never looked back. Love this app! One thing I would recommend is to put a timer on. I'd like to go to sleep listening to Spotify but I don't want my phone on all night. Hope you can get this going on the next update.
Would be better if you didnt add songs to our playlist so i can listen to what i want to listen instead of music you added based on algirythms to better suite our taste and add a user friendly service
"Been using it for years and it's great. Only irritating thing is having to manually clear the cache and occasionally reinstall to stop it taking up so much space. But if I do that it plays nice with my phone memory. Love everything else about it, so many great features for discovering music! Genuinely enhances my life. 5* from me!"
"Love it , its more customizable than Pandora. Also, you can build your favorites in different genres much faster. Long time Pandora user who tried Spotify and switched."
"OMG what do I say about Spotify? It's the best music app I've ever used. I've been through some doubts about using it time and again but ever since it came out in India I've installed it quickly. What I thought the best feature is the My Top Songs List, The My Repeat List and My Repeat Rewind list. I felt so good to find my music cherished and remembered and given back to me in the form of a gift that were those amazing Playlists. I hope the Spotify keeps surprising me provides peace like always"
Ux could be better. Would be great to have more flow. So many clicks and screen changes for what feel like intuitive paths.
"Has put music back into my life! As technology changed I grew tired of updating equipment, and eventually succumbed to whatever was on the radio. Now I get to choose again, but with infinitely more options."
"I have had Spotify for several years now. I push my Spotify button more than any other. I am quite codependent now and I'd like to leave it's a healthy codependency :) all the available songs\ from all the different genres past present and future. I eagerly anticipate spending the rest of my days with you in my life;Spotify never ever ever leave me ,"
Great music and easy interface. I love the modern design and color scheme just upgraded to premium and it is worth every penny!
"App does tend to lag a bit. Major annoyances include it not recognizing when wifi is available even when it is not set to offline mode, the app displays no connection. Time delay when play button is pressed. I have an s10+ so I am doubtful that it has anything to do with my O.S"
"I really enjoy Spotify overall, It is much better than Pandora my opinion because I can select one artist and I can pass over songs quickly... It is a much more efficient program...‚òò"
It's amazing it's easy to find music you want and build a playlist from that. The only down side is if you dony have premium theres just alot of adds but even with them it's still an enjoyable app
This app is pretty good but in order for you to download music you have to be a Premium Member which requires you to pay a certain amount of money. Offline mode also is useless cause your downloaded music is sometimes undownloaded . Otherwise it is an amazing app .üåùüåùüëçüëç
"Very nice selection of songs. Wish it would recommend songs more based on your ""liked"" playlist or ither playlists. It tends to only go by genres though. I ""liked"" a bunch of Indie songs, so all the recommend songs are about Indie music. Needs to be more like the style of song. Dance, rock, folk, etc. It just recommends random Indie songs not in the style I like. I loved Pandora because the did this and got it right. Then they changed everything and ruined it all. I still like spotify better tho"
"I love this app!! I drive a lot and listen to music and podcasts. I came a cross a problem with the app. I brought it to their attention. They were quick, attentive, and helpful! Thank you"
"Absolutely loving this app. I can find here any music I feel like listening to. The app creates playlists based on my choices, which is great for introducing me to different artists. There is also many great mood playlists to chose from. Also it is getting better for podcasts, there is quite a choice of different themes. Loving also the download option to save the battery and data on long drives"
"The only thing I hate is that the app doesn't have a play next button. Guess you do it on purpose, but it's bad. I shouldn't have to scroll from a queue of 100 songs for my desired next song. Please fix that."
I like it but I hate when I make a Playlist and they Add 1one I'm like Seriously! Barely This app knows My favourite Music Please make an option when we make a playlist that says : Do you want us to add some for you . And there's a button that says : Hmm Not sure or Sure! . because it's Making me Mad!
"Spotify's musical inventory is truly vast. Pick any song or or musical piece, and Spotify probably has it. But all the ways that music is curated to help you find music you like is quite impressive."
"Love the app so much, can play any music I can dream of.. Only one suggestion, I wish that I could pull down in my playlist to search for a specific song instead of going through a menu and finding the ""search in playlist button"". Find any song quick and easy would be amazing."
"I absolutely love that I can building a complete library with playlists & sounds that compliment my everyday, different moods. So much awesome music! Thank you, Spotify!"
"I use exclusively Spotify for my music, done so for the last 2 years with no complaints. Today i discovered the removal of the widget from my home screen. It was my main tool for song management, and a convenient one. it's removal is a spit in our face, which shows the company's complete disregard for user experience. I really hope they will rethink it, or sadly many of us will have to unsubscribe. ***Update*** So the community outcry helped, the widget is back"
"Solid service, lack functionality So i have spotify premium, its a nice service and helps the singers, BUT, it lack a function that even the most basic music player have and should be mandatory, you CANNOT tripple tap ur headphone button to go to previous track, u can skip one by double tap, but not the previous? Fix this men, it infuriates me everytime, i have to take my phone out every 5 mins. For an app ta offers paid service and basic service for freemium users, come on."
"It's good at intuiting your musical taste, but it's not human. Sometimes it gets boring and you just have to manually mix it up."
"I have never purchased a single app . Spotify had a promotion of giving away free Google home mini , so my friend subscribed for premium just for that but then never went back, he loved it and said ""it's just magical I dont want to leave this u sud try"" I was like I'm never going to give money for music which can be found for free on YT. But everything changed , this month spotify was giving 3 month free trial and I thought to give it a shot. Such great app with friendly ui awa fast download"
The big UI update a few months ago was an annoyance. My entire artist library disappeared and so I had to 'follow' every artist individually to restore it. Hate how liking an album forces you to save every single track to your library so you have to unlike the album itself and instead 'like' individual tracks to discard of the filler/remix tracks Bit clunky and needs a rework. Minus 1* for both causing this annoyance with the UI update abd because it took me 3 months to figure out the above
"One of the best music streaming platform. Fast response from their Customer Service. The only thing is, I hope that Spotify has an UNLIKE button for the LIKED songs. So we could edit the playlist. Also i need to move on and i want to forget all the songs that reminds me of him. Please.. üòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠"
"I have been using Spotify since 2016 and haven't seen any other music provider to have such variety of songs and playlists with an incredible UI. The main highlight of Spotify is it's loyal fanbase and now they have plans for students as which is such an incredible move, especially in countries like India. Talking about India, somehow they have managed to keep the prominent languages songs in their library which is awesome and shows that it has something to offer to everyone."
"Super cost effective access to a huge library, reliable, integrates into Google home, best UI, and the download music feature saves me Soo much data. Love it!"
"Great one stop shop for all my music, podcasts, and guided meditation playlists! Couldn't be happier with it's interface, and don't hate having my pre-existing Hulu account included in my subscription price now saving me $5/month!"
An amazing app for listening to your music. Managing playlists is really easy with Spotify and the music library in Spotify is huge. I like it's ease of use. Connecting it with Chromecast is also very easy. It is a genuinely nice app for listening to music. Cannot ask for more.
"I use spotify a lot and i do alleviate having any song i can imagine right at my finger tips any time i wish. Though i realize that it is necessary for the company to make some money, i wish it was more affordable to get a premium account. that, add maybe not have quite so many ads so often"
"Inutuituve, works on nearly any device, great interconnectivity. Hands down, the best music app out there. Spotify and its premium services are a must have."
"Terrific variety of music choices and the automatic groupings of songs on playlists was amazing. When picking artists, I liked many of the additional suggestions that popped-up for similar artists and music. I quickly created a huge selection of my favorite music that I enjoy hearing."
"Aside from the UI constantly changing and random pauses/glitches during podcast playback (which drives me insane when I can't constantly be touching my phone to fix it, but I'm dealing with it), it's a good app with access to plenty of content for a relatively cheap price."
"App is great. I use it quite a bit so I got a premium account. Well worth it. The algorithm for finding music, based on your liked songs is simple and effecient!"
Hey!!!!!!! Honestly I am just finding out about spotify and the new respectable way to have new music on the phone and its soo easy and my God.... listen to this Your magic algorithms have been suggesting songs I used to listen to allll day and cruise Anywho the 3 month promo is absolutely a good deal ... And only 10$ A MONTH after lol Please never change anything on your app Its amazing
4 stars since it is not quite as intuitive as I like. Plus the volume controls disappear from my lock screen (galaxy 9) when I pause the music.
"Very convenient way to explore new music. Compatible with a large range of equipment, including my Novafidelity X40, unlike Amazon music. It is a little more expensive than Amazon, which is why I only gave 4 stars"
"Wonderful app but the design updates are making it less and less useable. With the latest update I can't even pause or skip songs in the apl, I can only do it through my phones notification board. I use it a lot but they're slowly pushing me away."
This is the best music service other than YouTube Music that I have seen. The UI is top-notch on my Galaxy. I have one question about skipping songs though. Why am I only allowed to skip 6 songs an hour on my Saumsung A10e but I can skip double the songs on my Playstation or my PC.
This is an excellent app and easy to get started with. It is intuitive and introduces me to more similar music or podcasts that I like.
I had this application before but since I got another phone I added this app again. I love listening to music that I like. Great job. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!! I just listen to the Free music and it suits me just fine. I can listen to music from ALL Generations & I like this.
"Amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è Its been my favourite music app since so many years. The database is unlike any other streaming service. From Indie artists to newly released songs, it had everything you could want. My only complaint is that the UI seems outdated and needs a refresh, but apart from that, it's the absolute bestüôå‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Been using this for a couple of years now,and I find it decently reliable. Not many issues besides some functions but those are build in and can see how'd they help others."
"This is the best streaming music player, I've ever used.The interface is very intuitive and the design of the app is outstanding. This makes Spotify stand out from the crowd. Other apps don't look that nice compared to this guy.Then, we get almost 50m+ songs. But, however this app doesn't have some of the songs from artist like Coldplay, Linkin Park etc. Prosüëç Awesome design and interface Daily mix Wide variety of playlists Consüëé No wide variety of songs No wide variety of artists Costly"
"Haven't tested them all, but Spotify is pretty righteous y'all. Smooth intuitive app, great mixes and the selection hasn't disappointed yet. Wu-Tang Shame on a Ninja! ü§òüèª"
I love the Spotify app you have all the music in the world right at your fingertips easy to use allows you to download music to play offline make your favorite playlist. Easy to navigate through the app love the graphics the layout well worth it download it now you won't regret it whatever type of music you like Spotify has it.
The only thing I don't like is how the set up is for podcasts as I am used to Apple and recently switched to android and I am now using Spotify for podcasts but not finding it quite as user friendly.
"I find Spotify very useful and very well designed. I love the features and love all of the Playlists I can make. So overall, it's a good music app in my opinion. 10/10"
"Best music app/subscription I've had. Responsive, intuitive interface, easy plans, and a great selection of music."
It's totally perfect for me not gonna lie even the free users enjoy the app as much as the premium guys for me I'm all into music and I'm like always in this app Good UI Good song selections and playlists Perfect music streaming app for me.
Everything I have ever wanted to listen to has been and is at my fingertips. Always ready and waiting. Quickly found. And even suggestions made by Spotify have been and are very much welcome. Even though my tastes are diverse and cover many categories and generations there has never been any delay in gaining access. Thank you Spotify for making my listening experience memorable and first class.
My to go to. I love that it makes mix of music I will actually like and want to press the like button on. Spotify is a one stop shop for all music and entertainment lovers.
The app is great and very easy to use. I did have some issues logging in beacuse i couldnt remember the email and password i used and i needed to cancel my premuim. I contacted Spotify and they promptly got back to me and resolved the issue. I was amazed at how fast they got back to me. Kuddos to you Spoitify!!
"Love that they have an offline mode. The UX is nice, the recommendation engine is impressive and there's nothing frustrating about it. Great app overall."
"Fantastic, but not if you don't want to pay. I have the family plan [I was previously paying 99 cents for 3 months] that my sister pays for and if we continue this cycle, I might pitch in every now and then. It's worth it though. I genuinely enjoy using this app."
A wonderful service and app that after a year I'd find it hard to live without but full of annoying quirks. Like the inability to add playlists to the queue and wonderful but weirdly limited clock integration which makes it easy to select a playlist but not a single song.
"I've come from google play music to this and its just sooo much better in terms of UI, sound quality, selection, and recommendation. SPOT-on."
"Great app overall however, since the latest update it has become quite unstable with multiple crashes and frequent lockups. I hope this will be resolved soon."
Brilliant app and really loved it's UI but this app automatically download songs again and again. Really frustrating sometimes. Hope you'll work upon this.
"I do enjoy this application, the sound quality is superior, started to really enjoy my Yamaha a/v system that is having spotify built in, the synchorization between the different devices started to get much better as well, I just keep discovering and jumping between different albums, artists, go to song radio, and the suggested weekly discover through the app is just amazing, just hope spotify won't be missing any song or performance that might be available on different platform."
The most convenient and featured music app I have ever used. The UI is good and hoping that the dark theme remains the same. The equalizer is a boon. The convenience here is that you can pay 13 rupees to get premium for a day. I REQUEST SPOTIFY NOT TO REMOVE THIS AS 13 RUPEES FOR A DAY IS A VERY GOOD DEAL!
"Great music, some technical difficulties. There's a ton of great artists and songs on this app. I love the options and how easy it is to make playlists. Sometimes my Spotify will not connect to the internet even when I have mobile LTE. That can be very frustrating, especially when the playlists I've downloaded are suddenly no longer downloaded. Overall, I love this app. But recently the above issues have made me question continuing to pay for it."
"Overall a great experience, but the buttons aren't really intuitive and you just have to learn where to press (coming from normal Android music player). Otherwise perfect."
"The app is great but could use a lot of work. The built-in music player is horrible, only if there was a way to play audio through my Samsung Music App"
"I miss some more advanced settings. It's too user friendly. (Same applies to PC UI UX) There is space for improvement. Otherwise it's cool like you can sit in a bathroom with your phone and see what's playing on the PC next room. Search is very fast for mainstream songs. Easy to create playlists. Everything works more or less very quick. Anyways you know that already, as - everything I'm saying."
"Best music streaming service, hands down. It builds playlists based on the music you've played and updates the playlists daily. The playlists are sorted by genre which is great."
"I love spotify! Ive been paying for premium for about a year now and dont know how i lived without it üòÄ‚ù§Ô∏è not only can you listen to your favourite music, i've also discovered probably close to a hundred more artists that i love and would have had no idea they existed without Spotify. Being able to download and listen to your favourite tunes without using your data in seconds is lux, i would highly recommend paying for premium you might not think you need it but...you do , thank you Spotify!!"
"Solid app, only flaw is it closes down in the background quite quickly which can have odd effects if casting or playing on Sonos or similar. Didn't get this issue on other music services"
Mostly good. IMO they should give the thumbs down option in all the screens and learn from user feedback. It is an option in some screens and not others. Quite good at picking what you like but nothing like as good as Last FM.
This app is great if you subscribed to Spotify premium. There are however a few issues for me that's quite annoying like: - Opening the app and suddenly finding my downloaded music/playlists not being recognized as downloaded so I have to connect back to the internet and redownload them (the good thing is that you dont really have to redownload but the app just has to re-read the existing downloaded files and it only takes several seconds) - Volume control unavailable on active mobile device
"Works well, as a premium user never had a problem with it and believe it's well worth purchasing a subscription, loads songs quickly even when data or wifi is weak(for me at least) 20/10 would recommend"
"I like the way the font is used in the app and the UI is absolutely stunning. I will never uninstall the app, until the font or UI is changed. For the visual experience, this is probably the best music app available in the market, IMHO."
I have only ever had 1 issue in the almost 2 years I've had Spotify and it was resolved extremely quickly with no hassle. Would say it is definitely worth getting premium as I use the app on a daily basis for multiple hours of listening.
Its mostly quite good recomendations are useful but the whole skipping songs being a privilage is stupid like i shouldnt pay money to skip or select certain songs if you dont have premium it can be an extremely annoying app
"At first I was skeptical, but Spotify quickly became my go to source for music listening and discovery. Can't recommend it enough!"
"Best music app, no contest. Great UI, sleek and beautiful, lots of customization options, and last but not least, amazing customer service!! Definitely recommended. 5/5"
It's cool. It's a good music app. Lots of music. I might have confused it because it can't quiet pin down what kind of music I like. I just wish when it said 15 or 30 minutes of add free music it meant 15 or 30 minutes. I timed it. It does not. I still highly recommend.
"Finally, Spotify is in India. I was feeling so guilty to use their app for free by using cracked versions for over a year now. Thanks Spotify, I love you guys. You make my day happy everyday. Edit : Giving 4 stars now because of the following reasom, still love the app though, but when is the Warner catalogue returning to Spotify? Most of my favorite artists are signed with Warner Music/Chapell. At least give us a date or something Spotify."
The best and extensive collection of Baroque and Western Classics. Can't start my day without my Allegro playlist on Spotify. So are the audio quality and user experience üëèüëèüëè
"Spotify is just great. It needs a little learning curve with the UI/UX, but once you get it, it is great."
"In terms of catalog and quality of music available, it's probably best in class. The android app, and by extension probably also the desktops apps, have a pretty terrible UX. Trying to figure out how to do something pretty straightforward can be quite difficult at times. The family plan is good value though and is good to be able to disable explicit content for your kids. One feature I'd like to see is content whitelisting for my kids."
Always used it. Tried a few other apps but they aren't as fluid and nice as spotify. Plus the dark background is great for at night.
"The BEST of THE BEST!!! I cannot rate this high enough! I use this app day & night, night & day. Its affordable, MUCH cheaper than my iTunes bill each month when I was an exclusive iOs junkie. I still have/use my iOs devices but find myself switching quickly back to my android/Spotify relationship. High quality, huge range of artists, fantastic playlists & suggestions, amazing new talents to discover. I loveloveLOVE my Spotify & I can't see it changing, especially when they consistently ROCK!"
"Ok,this one is the best working one so far. Haven't encountered any glitches(yet). Please don't modify anything on this app to the point it's unusable again. Podcasts finally downloading,songs finally not automatically deletes and downloads itself again. Not much changed from last version UI,but the UX is definitely improved. Now I don't mind spending $10 a month for an excellent music streaming service that's actually working :)"
"Very amazing app have been using premium for quite a while, would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that some music that used to be there, I can no longer listen to, I can still see it on my downloads but I cannot play to it as it's no longer on Spotify I guess? it's confusing and sad."
"Spotify has become my most used and favourite app! It's incredibly simple to use, but it has a lot of features built in. Definately gonna tell my friends about this app (they probably already know about Spotify)."
i have been using spotify every day for years and have never had a problem with it. the ui is very functional and i love the customizability of the eq. thank you spotify
Love this app!! It has great daily mixes that they make for your specific preferences. It goes 30 minutes straight. Then you see 1 quick 10 second video. Then 30 more minutes. I can deal with that!! Very easy to use and simple to navigate‚Ä¶
"It's a really nice and neat app with good UI and nice curated playlist recommendations. However there are some songs that aren't available in my region (India) and that's kind of a bummer to have to go to YouTube for one song. Also, I think they should rethink their prices if they actually want to sell premium especially in India"
"This app has been the best I've had as of yet through great network and playlists I can alter to only play my favorites from and leave out the artists I dont prefer. Through clear selection guides and laymen features i like, it's of great clarity for users and listeners that can alter list at all times."
I love spotify its great at the gym or at school or at home or on the bus or just anywhere you want to listen to your music! It leads quicker than you tube thank God ü§£üòÇ totally recommended if you want to listen to music where you can actually turn your phone off so you can keep doing whatever it is your doing
"I couldn't get through some of the jobs without have some good music to listen to, love the playlists that get built for me, couldn't be more fitting and some of the artist I never would have listened to ended up actually liking and all thanks to you guys. Keep up the good work. ‚è≠Ô∏è‚è©‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚è™‚èÆÔ∏èüîäüéµüé∂üá∫üá∏"
"Spotify has the whatever I want to listen to. Whether I am in an easy acoustic guitar or Jazz to Heavy Metal, Classical or Rock mood, Spotify has it at my finger tips or Google Home App."
I am a premium user and I am really enjoying the service. One of the best app which creates recommendation based on your listening. Tried all the other music app but this is the best. Smooth UI and no lag.
Can't find my downloads. When my data is off or not connected to WiFi. I only find album's that are not downloaded in my library. And I have subscribed for primuim.
"Works flawlessly on both platforms. Sound quality is excellent but changeable for those who are kinda strict on mobile data at the end of the month. Suggestion algorithms work like a charm. Lastly, the UI is sleek, modern and flat with a plethora of colors."
"Its been fantastic so far, I can find all the quick releases and other songs. Although I would like them to include more varieties too."
its a good app the only problem i have is sometime while im playing a song i would lag then the app would crash and i would have to replay it again and sometimes for example when i play kendrick lamar humble the next song i play it would not play automayically i would have to hit play button can they please fix them if they can
"Great selection, quick downloads, only drawback that I have is after selecting a song from a search, the menu returns to ""recommendations"". I have to re-search to find the previous menu. It may just b me not knowing how to properly use. Overall great!"
Everything is great except when I pay for premium and download songs it still uses y data to listen to them unless I specifically go into offline mode. Just bad design.
Simply the best Music Streaming Platform. Spotify has an amazing user experience due to its beautiful interface and fluid navigation. The streaming is really smooth. And its super amazing that you can play music and control it on and through various devices. The playlists are carefully crafted for every mood. Great job Spotify Team. Its super fun and addictive to use. Kudos to the UI Designers as well.
"I love it, but quite a few songs that i would like to play aren't on the app or are just unavailable for me. I don't quite know why this is. Overall I'm happy with Spotify."
"Great app but it seems to have slowed down quite a bit. Searching, playing songs, everything. Same experience with LTE network and on my WiFi at home (fibre optic)"
"Hey spotify.. The app's super cool with around 99% of songs being covered, ever been recorded.. Appreciate that! But i would like to bring a glitch into your notice.. Whenever you listen to songs while you device's screen is locked, and an app pops out.. (non premium account).. Tha plaback stops, until and unless you really unlock the screen and open the app.. This interrupts the seamless flow and is quite irritating.. please see through this.. except that... Stupendous App! :)"
"Spotify has a pretty wide range of songs of good hearing quality, but it's biggest flaw is it's awful UI design, the rest is absolutely fine."
"Didn't expect the high quality of sound, easy to use and works super great with your Xbox. There's like a slider but you just have to press a button to open and you can adjust the split on the volume between game volume and Music volume without even pausing the game"
A awesome app that is able to search for any songs you are looking for. Would prefer if there is a section or button to allow us adding our lyrics into our own playlist.
I've had Spotify premium for quite a while now and I love that I can download endless amounts of music as I drive all day and don't always have cell service (plus those data rates would be insane!) however there is no longer a widget for Samsung and it's not possible to sort the artists you have downloaded in alphabetical order like you could a few months ago. Why Spotify? Why? Let me sort my downloaded artists so it's easier to find what I want!
Really good. The Indian version still doesn't have certain songs and artists but overall it makes music on the go very very convenient. And I love the design and UI.
"Love love love Spotify. Ability to follow playlists, download for offline use, collaborate with friends on playlists, share playlists/songs outside of the app, and the incredible ""built for you"" playlists Spotify puts together based on songs/ genres you like! Can't say enough about Spotify. Would be lost without it."
Best music app there is by far. They create playlists suited to you. Couldn't ask for a better music experience.
"The best music and podcast app for your daily musical needs or your daily dose of podcasts. You can find almost every song and podcast you know of here. Global and local collections, complete. You can use it for free, unlike Apple Music. This app is also the music streaming app with the best integrations with third party apps, voice assistants, and even cars. I highly recommend for all kinds of music listeners, from kids to adults. This app is easy to use and straightforward, no hassle in the UX"
Great app. Think the interface could be more intuitive. Things are hidden and buried too much. also many features of Pandora app are better imo. Still great tho.
Updated to 4* for bringing back the android widget. Leaving off the last one as a reminder: Don't waste your customer's time having to downgrade and disable updates to keep a necessary feature. I bet the developers knew there would be backlash and a manager thought they knew better. Replace that person with someone who understands UX.
Excellent. I read all the complaints some people posted on here. But they're forgetting one big thing. IT'S FREE QUIT WHINNING!! Well worth the monthly charge. Way better than iHeartRadio. Taking advantage of the 90 day free trial. Only reason I stayed with iHeartRadio is because Ron Burgundy was on there. Come to find out he's on Spotify also. Love Spotify.
"This is the best app for listening to music even without a subscription,yes there is an ad every 5 or 6 songs but that is bearable.Also the sound quality is good and a large collection of songs is available.Edit-Please keep the place for the repeat button constant,i have blocked many times the song i want to listen on repeat."
"Lately, especially with podcasts, if my phone screen is locked, Spotify with stop playing unless I unlock my screen. This is quite annoying. Otherwise, it's get a 5/5."
"couldn't live without it now. fantastic. if I change my mood, I can change my music to suit, without purchasing a whole album of which you may only like a few tracks. love it ."
"Song recommendations are very good. Application UI is friendly. Song quality is also very nice. Overall, this application is best for music lover's."
"it's good in the sense that u can have a wide variety of songs, which are of good quality. (the ads are actually quite tolerable). however, can Spotify pls fix their shuffle play system? like it doesn't even shuffle play, more of repeating the songs that you've heard already in your playlist. pls fix this Spotify üòï"
"Love love love this app is the only thing I dislike is if your premium ran out to you have to deal with all the commercials and you only have so many skips but that's why I pay for premium which is definitely worth it especially the offline mode I have yet to find a song that they do not have, actually quite the opposite I have found many, many many songs because of a Spotify!!!"
"Spotify is hands down the best music streaming service. Excellent music selection, great user experience, and easy to use on multiple devices."
"I like Spotify. It's fairly cheap, and manages the task of organizing my music quite well. Their playlist suggestions are helpful when looking for new music."
I do love the extensive assortment of categories. It's still so overwhelming as I'm jumping around all over the place trying to listen to everything quickly as if it's all going to disappear in the next few minutes! I've never experienced such a feeling of exhilaration! Do try.... Gillian(a new user of the internet & what it has to offer)
"Pretty fast, but UI has shuffle pay button too prominent for premium users and switching to other songs by same artist is much harder than with web player (which is disabled for mobile users)."
"The only thing I don't like is that some songs get removed occasionally. Other than that, it's really nice to use. The fact that you can still make your own playlists, even if you just have the free version, is really nice. Plus, premium gives me a bunch of features and benefits that are nice and I use them all quite frequently. Overall, this is my favorite music service."
"The new UI design needs work, some of the functions are basically hidden such as Podcast and a the to access music genres. The music algorithm also requires improvement, the playlists displayed on the main tab of the app should be customizable, ignoring genres you don't listen to and showing accurate recommendations of something that you might find interesting, instead to adding list with ""hot"" music that's is not related with the music you actually listen to on the app."
"Just love Spotify............lot of music apps just get money by premiums and provide nothing......Spotify has...infact every song that i can listen free.......With simple and attractive interface, lot of songs, user friendly UI......spotify is the best music app on the charts!"
"Spotify is one of the best music apps that you would find on play. The music quality is quite good and there is an option to make your own playlists. Along with that there are many other playlists based on different occasions. The premium version is very expensive and without that you'd have to tolerate advertisements in between and you won't be able to download music and save it in offline mode. Overall, it's quite better than the others for sure."
"This app is just sensational. It has such a great design, easy to deal with, and the premium version offers an offline mode that is perfect for listening to music anywhere at anytime."
"Ok so I might have a different experience since I have a premium subscription but this is just the most convenient, all platform-friendly, and well designed music app."
"It is easy to use, you can download songs to listen to offline and I like their intuitive play lists. It is the music app I have used the most. And I have used them all. It is hands down better than Google Music, iTunes or Tidal."
Good app. But search is not untuitive. A slight spelling mistake does not show intended artist or song - even one character out of place messes the search.
"Best music app I've used from Apple music, tidal, SoundCloud and play. Occasionally they have bugs but fixed quickly and the recommendations are always spot on. Easy to navigate and to find the music you want. One thing I will mention - if you have a Samsung phone and have optimise battery usage turned on for the app in settings - the app can cut out when the phone locks - this bug showed up for me a few months ago and was annoying until I turned off the setting. App works perfectly again now."
Best f****ng app for music. But iOS version is so much better. More intuitive to work with (queue slide function etc.). Why am i not able to swipe down for search? Make it better please. Make the change happen
Keeps switching storage from SD to Internal after One UI update on Samsung. Deleting all downloaded files. Storage permissions on as well. Latest update absolutely trashed performance. Back to Tidal
spotify ruined their ui . i can no longer sort my playlists to show up in the order i have put them in originally in my desktop app. theyve taken away the sorting option for ordering all your playlists in overall view of all playlists at once..you can still re order songs within rhe playlists but not the playlists themselves.
"Just a great source of music that learns and find music that might or is your preference. The different in looking at genre and music listening so that it builds the proper channel so you can enjoy, specific or expanded song selection. I left Pandora to try this and never looked back. I have been tempted, by YouTube music."
Only worth 3+ stars if you have premium. One thing I do have to complain about is the terrible song suggestions and auto playlists. The app is otherwise convenient and quite enjoyable.
"Exceptional!!!!!!!! I am quick to reccomend Spotify to all that ask, no ads, flawless playlists as long as you remember to download to your device.....lolol forgot it a time or two & no music unless I had WiFi"
"The fact that they removed the widget in the newest update is absolute garbage. Obviously they can have a widget, obviously quite a few people liked it. Skipping songs is now a lot more work. EDIT: added 2 star due to widget return"
If anyone could please add a add to the queue feature directly from a playlist otherwise it's quite annoying finding the album of the song then adding it . Besides that everything is good.
"Songs will stop playing sometimes when playing with screen off. I've downloaded the song, so it's not buffering. Please fix this as it's quite annoying."
"Although one cannot expect every obscure artist to be here, they have an impressively large library, great UI. I'd die without this app. Perfect 5/7"
"One start less for not including lyrics üò¨. Besides this the app is fantastic. I love music and this is the perfect app for me. I love its UI, its very smooth."
Makes listening to music simple. The design is nice and sleek. Easy to navigate app and it has a large selection of songs to choose from.
"Getting worse and worse. i havent been quite happy with the different changes over the year, but since i mostly used the widget it was fine by me. now ut has been removed and i can't for the life if me understanding why. i guess this gives me a gokd reason to really consider using Google Play Music now since I'm paying for both anyway i may as well use the one with the better experience even if it's not seeing updates anymore. Edit: it's back, I'm happy again"
It's been about 2 years since I used Spotify for the first time. I started with free the changed to premium and it's been good for every purpose. One thing I would like you to add is a search button in the playlists section. (The one that's in the options)
Everything is great except the fact you can't block a particular artist in general from ever playing at all on any station. For example. I absolutely positively HATE & LOATHE ENTIRELY with every atom in my body Taylor Swift her voice is enough to make me suicidal and her lyrics make me hate her mother who should of used a condom. And yet it is the main thing I miss from my old music app that you can choose to NEVER hear from artists again even if they are just featured in a song.
"Better! Had Tunein Radio for quite a few years, my go-for podasts, and occasional music. Lately, get a lot of ""cannot decode stream"" messages and has become very frustrating. This app I don't experience that, or constant buffering. Thanks for a better alternative."
"Very good app for music on the go. Only thing is the user interface is not intuitive. I have difficulty navigating it. The LIKED button should also give us an option to place the song in different albums we created. As when you have 500 favorite songs all in one folder, it's difficult to sort them into individual album subsequently."
It honestly surpasses all of the other music streaming apps with its easy to use software but also up to date designs and music. And also for a VERY low price!!!
The best music app you'll ever need! The app learns your music taste and generates great music suggestions accordingly. Great user experience and design as well.
It was all good but too much ads. And this might quite big request that I think we all should be able to listen to any songs that we want that might not be in our playlist. If you understand me
"Keep Netflix, prime and Deezer this is the ultimate streaming service. I listen to this app through most of the day wether in my car, at the office or at home. The algorithm which builds playlists and ""radio"" playlists is fabulous and the quality of sound is top notch. The best streaming service and app bar none!"
Initial sign up Trial version highly rated. If you need a stream to entertain at a gathering then get the account and divide with 5 others will be worth the ¬£3/month. Utilise the mixing option in settings= no track gaps.. Build your playlists in logical order as moving them around after isnt easy at all... Sound quality adjustable and differs with different devices. All in all a great non speaking auto DJ set can be run by Spotify..
"Love it! I can easily search for podcasts, music & more. Intuitive interface. Steady streaming. I have the free version (what can I say, I'm poor!) but haven't found ads to be bothersome. My favorite app~"
"This is a very intuitive and intelligent app it has a very diverse and extensive music library so can easily become very addictive, be careful how you use it, it's that good!"
"Spotify us a very impressive streaming service the music is literally at your fingertips. I love the ability to curate your own playlist and share them, the only thing I wish they would implement in the future is to develop a more social feature in the built in app that makes sharing playlist easier"
"It's the best music app on this planet. although, the past 2 or 3 weeks, it pauses whenever i lock my phone... it's quiet annoying and idk how to fix that."
"I faced some issues with login, but it was resolved very quickly! The support team is amazing, a shout-out to them! The app in itself is beautiful, the playlists they suggested are the freaking best of all time! Probably the best music streaming appüíØüíØ"
"Excellent choice and range. Works well with car audio, if not a little quiet. Mixing option good for short breaks between tracks"
"Meticulously designed and fast app but is missing music, especially if you dont just listen to recent English pop music. Usually doesn't even show you missing music (greyed out or whatever), just pretends songs don't exist, when they damn well know they do. You should add the ability to stream torrents."
"Thank you for listening to your user base. The return of the Android widget puts you back at 5 Stars. I love how all of the Android devices throughout my house will show my what is playing and allow me to manage how it is playing. Combined with Google Chromecast Audio (Damn you for discontinuing them Google), I have created my dream music listening scenario. I have some type of Android device (sometimes just my phone) located in every room of my house. I have a variety of speakers in every room. Google Home allows me to combine all of the speakers into a group. Spotify will play to that group. Whole House music for cheap that I can control in each room."
Absolutely fantastic great selection of music every song I have searched for has only been a click away a quick add gives you 30 mins of uniterupted music 5 stars if this rating went to 10 it would be a ten star rating thanks guys brilliant software.
Been using Spotify premium for years. Never really had a problem except the native/web client doesn't work on Linux. Apart from that I like building playlists and being able to share and collaborate with friends
"(Edit: They added the widget, fixed the homescreen, so bumped it up to 5*.) Was great, but an update messed up the play and skip buttons that pops up on the lock screen where it doesn't work and I have to open up the app. They also got rid of the widgets for the app making it a necessity to open the app to change anything. It's still a great service with good quality and many selections of songs, along with great directed recommendations at times, but now average."
Awesome!!!! Loving it. Got the widget for Android but it lacks Equalizer so proposing a Poweramp type amplifier inbuilt into the native app or the option to play spotify premium through poweramp unlocked player.
I think that multiple profiles in an account will improve the application. A common problem I experience is that when I give someone my phone to put music in the car and he puts the songs he wants it ruins the algorithm. Someway to disable the algorithm when needed will be good.
"Very wonderful way of listening to music. Very intuitive, I just wish there were a little bit more features"
"The app is pretty good, but I have few things. Firstly we got family mix, which is premium, but I still get spotify premium popup ads and it's kind of a pain. Also the hide this song ban button has disappeared (although I still have a list of songs I've previously hidden) and that's also very annoying. Please fix."
"Great music streaming app with one of the best UI, and much faster than any other app that I ever used. Waited for so long to get spotify and it didn't disappoint me, good collection and lot of new genre's to discover."
"I rarely review anything on here, in fact I'm not sure I ever have, but, wow. Spotify is the single most revolutionary product to happen to legal music since the cassette tape. Never in the history of the human experience have we been able to instantly play the majority of popular music ever recorded. This is a luxury that was not even known to the wealthiest audiophiles or music execs. And now for less than the price of eating out once each month, anyone can have unlimited streaming! Bravo."
"I have been using Spotify for a few months now and I am very pleased by it. I think that it's worth getting the premium. The subscription price is really fair for where I live (‚Ç¨5), though it is more expensive in other places. The free version is quite limiting (no offline and limited skips)."
"Building my play lists with songs I want to hear is easy. Can build by theme or my mood (fast, slow, rock, etc) No skips or interruptions asking am I still listening. Wonderful selection of songs!"
I give this app a five cause it sanding but there is still time for improvement!. Like having a consistent button that takes you back to the playlist you're currently hearing/on.
"- Good support for quick switching between multiple devices. - Playlists, playlist folders, and playlist order in the menu can be manually set on the desktop client, but not on mobile. - Great selection for podcasts in the app. - Fewer audio playback issues when compared to other music streaming services. - Homescreen Widget and playlist shortcuts make playing music quick and easy. - Great integration with Shazam. - Responsive and easy to use."
"Over all amazing app, great UI and is easy to use. The only problem ive found is that when i go to download songs it says its downloading but never does."
"Great app. I decided to pay for no commercials after about 6 months at $9 99. It was a good decision. Hubby jumped on board a few months ago. We now pay $14.99 a month and we each have our own home page and can listen to what we like 24/7. Customized lists are easy to build it takes a bit of time at first. I am still adding to mine. I now listen to podcasts, who'd of thunk. All in all a good value for the money. Beats the radio while traveling too, everytime."
"It's clean and simple to use, and has a huge variety. I'm quite impressed by that, actually, because I wasn't sure they'd have much of what I like, but I've found a lot of my favourite songs on here. They handle ads pretty well, and though I wish I could download without paying, I think that's fair. My only complaint is that sometimes it's hard to find songs unless you know the exact title. But you can easily just look that up elsewhere before looking for the actual song here."
"The BEST music streaming service!!! Very convenient,user friendly,intuitive interface, billions of content of every existing genre."
A truly great music streaming service. I love the ability to create my own playlists and being able to listen to new musicians. Spotify passed my standard test of having lots of classical music by Ginastera and the two discs released by the young singer/songwriter and bass guitar player Tal Wilkenfeld. My one grumble (hence only 4-stars) is that there are only MP3 files to download and no FLAC files.
"It's a good app, but why don't you put the settings button at the Your Library menu too? It's such a hassle to always go to the home menu just to go into settings. And also please put the swipe to add to queue function like on ios!!! Why do we have to compromise with all the features? Shouldn't it be the same??"
Some of the foreign song are incomplete but its quite nice for not having to much music to be downloaded as it costing to much space on the phone. Overall its good
Fantastic ui and even more personalisation settings are in user's hands but i think you should include more languages than just indian ones like korean for eg. Also inclusion of lyrics in all songs will be great.
I love this app. I have Premium and I love it. I love features like live lyrics and storyline but the UI is very clunky. I know it's difficult to design and program an app this complex but it needs a new design.
Spotify has changed my life and I may soon come to find that I owe all of my success in life to Spotify. My career was essentially ruined but Spotify provided hope and has a high likelyhood of success for me. Thank you to all those involved with making Spotify happen. -Preston Hudman
Lost a star. Recent update has removed the quick option buttons in the discography that was great for adding albums to playlists without having to go into the album.
"I'm loving this app all my music is here. I am a premium member and I am asking for an update where get themes, I like the color but it is getting old. You can have Spotify designed themes and also let the public design it and you can decide to put in the app. I really want to change the color please make it happen."
"Only music app I listen to & having Premium is well worth it! Love that I can say playlist, create my own playlist and am able to download songs for offline use (tho it does eat up a mega amount of my internal storage - iPhone unfortunately does not offer the hardware that is needed for additional external storage nor are they designed to house such thing....ie - SD cards/micro cards/etc....so Apple get with the program please!!!!) So it would be nice if the songs didn't eat up so much storage!"
"This could definitely improve. Random stops, UI confusing somethimes, IE heart and unlike/ skip not consistent. I realize some lists/ radio doesn't have unlike, but the heart is on the opposite side then? long time paid user and every update over the years just doesn't end up with just a simple solid pleasant experience. If it is supposed to be a learning algorithm then i don't see why like/ dislike is available everywhere. And with dislike please have the algorithm figure out artist or song."
"Comparatively better apps, but need to improve. In android no preview of songs of album, so you need only forward button to see next song. You can't play the desired song directly from album. So need to update. Songs collection are very good. No radio station preview in android phone."
"It plays music, so it works. 10 outa 10. Also the customer service for fixing any problems with app respond quickly and are highly knowledgeable!"
"Love the app! BUT PLEASE bring back the on/offline button in the notification bar with Android! It's very useful! Also have troubles connecting with Alexa, seeing forward to a solution :)"
"Works reliably, deals with connection issues generally better than other streaming apps I use. Controls might be slightly more intuitive. I like the integration, like communication between players on other devices, which does not always work 100% but is still a nice feature. Spotify's recommendation algorithm works very well for me. Edit: Widget is back after many users complained and/or rage-quit. Thanks for listening, Spotify."
"Best music streaming service hand's down. The only complaint I have is the fact that I just tried Spotify for the first time like a month ago, after a decade of Slacker & Pandora. Basically the free version of Spotify is equivelent to slacker plus. They also offer a full 3 month trial subscription, which is the longest trial offered by any streaming service. Mention that you're a Spotify subscriber in your Tinder profile, & watch how crackin' our inbox get's."
I have been using Spotify for quiet a while and i am impressed. It is very different from other music apps and i really seem to enjoy it . Great job.......
I love this app and use it literally every day; but im not the biggest fan of the last update's redesign of how to find specific songs in my library; i liked just being able to scroll down and have a search bar!
"I have been using Spotify for almost three years now and I must say it has been awesome .. At one point there was a hiccup with my premium account due to an issue out of my control, but it was fixed quickly. I love it!"
"Superb music app!! Only change which SERIOUSLY needs attention is the placement of the ""download"" switch located right next to the shuffle button. Horrible!! I have undownloaded my songs several times already. Please fix this! Thanks"
"Its great and all but they should make it like on pc. Because whenever I want to play a different song it doesnt let me, and on the pc it did. And how do I not play recommended songs, it can be quite annoying."
"No stones left unturned! Most awesome and intresting music app you will ever find. The thing i like most about it, if you play a song in search bar, it gives most relevant and similar song suggestions which is difficult to find in other apps. Moreover, it's graphics and playlists are literally loveable."
I had to download an older version of Spotify because you guys messed the app up so much and ruined it in the last update. Saved me from switching to another music streaming app.
"This app is the #1 in my opinion (And a lot of others, because it is #1). It has never not have a song that I want, and all-in-all great app. I would recommend getting the premuim edition."
"I have Spotify on every day at work and in my car. When I do listen to the radio and hear a song I like, I immediately find it on Spotify and I get a station that plays other songs that I find I enjoy too! Makes my work day go by quickly and painlessly!"
"Pretty good I'm on the free version currently, and it's really good! With the exception of a large chunk of game music, it has all I like on there, and I like niche music. Really good, no issues. Recommended Edit: now on premium (perfectly fine, no ploblems) and have suffered through 2 different design changes, this is fine but having the option to switch back would be nice."
"I love the app! Best music streaming app to my experience so far! There are so many genres and specific playlists, absolutely recommend it. My only problem, since the last update, keeps crashing for me. It happens when the app isn't open and music is playing in the background, when the app is open, when I'm connected to a bluetooth speaker or just using the phone's speaker. This is quite annoying and apparently quite common. Please fix this in a next update!"
"Loads of songs, lots of podcasts. Interface could be updated and missing features like auto download and smart build playlists"
Great app. Catch up on all my podcasts and have a few playlists for the daily commute. Easy to use and intuitive
"Family plan is definitely worth it especially living with 2 siblings. Simple yet elegant UI, easy to use and navigate through."
This is by far the best musical streaming service out there. And the app is well designed and function's without a hitch. I give it 4 stars as they took away the Spotify widget which was very convenient to use.
"Sometimes I try to intuitively select a song and make it play, but for some reason I hear another song. I would like to have an ad after 5 or 10 songs to suggest a song based on my favorite ones or something and not like the current process."
The daily playlists are very well customised and suit my music style. Discovering new music has become very easy and better in quality.
"The app rarely crash now, thanks to the regular update and bug fixing. The new design is nice and smooth."
"My absolute favorite music streaming app! Great quality of sound, building endless playlists, huge selection of artists. All around wonderful."
Overall a good app. Smooth UI and good selection of music. My one complaint is that when you make a Playlist Spotify adds their own recamended songs.
"Spotify is great. One suggestion: if you guys adjust library tab to be more compact and quicker to access, it will be great. Great job anyway."
"Excellent. Even the free service is quite unobtrusive. With a fantastic selection of artists in all styles. Very easy to navigate and use, even for a first timer."
I love this app's UI design and all the functions of the application works! I never had a problem with spotify and use this app everyday on my normal commute to work and back home! You host all of my favorite musicians on this platform as well üòç Keep up the great work and shoutout to your software engineers as well for holding it down!
"Love the app! The free version is more than enough for me. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars, is because I can't change the home ""landing page"" from music to podcasts. Other than that - I have no complaints. I love the fact that you have the ability to create a playlist for listening to podcast episodes from different shows in the order you want. The interface is clear & simple, yet intuitive. Overall - brilliant app!"
"Great collection of songs, playlists, and beautiful UI. But please add more Indian songs as other music apps have, especially the old ones which are sadly missing in your app."
Personally I think Spotify is the best streaming option in the current market. The app design can be a little wonky at times though.
"I LOVE spotify premiuim, it keeps me going on my long drives, my homework and when I clean my house. I listen to my own playlist and can download them for on the go. I have yet to have a problem. Love that I switched from pandora"
The app isnt super intuitive and sometimes featurs you use will disappear. The service works pretty well though and the integration with podcasts and rxtensive music library is pretty great.
"A few bugs, such as the music stopping when the screen is off for some time then continuing to play and the widget of spotify going woosh. But really worth it"
"Switched from Pandora and will never go back. Spotify is very intuitive. Easy to move from one audio device to another flawlessly. Would like to see more consistency between the interfaces. Windows app, web site, android to android auto all are slightly different."
By far best streaming app. I had itune but it was very heavy and lagging all time. Spotify is cheaper quicker and easy to customise. glad I made this move
"I use it all the time, it's the quickest and easiest way to have access to quality music everywhere. It is without a doubt one of the best tools to find music too, as it provides fantastic recommendations. Would recommend any day!"
"I really like Spotify and it's support of so many plattforms (IOS, Android, Windows, OSX, Linux). I don't listen to Podcasts but I do enjoy listening to new music; ""Discover Weekly"" and ""Release Radar"" are perfect for me therefor. The only thing i don't like is, that I can't configure or edit my ""Daily Mixtapes"" e.g. renaming or setting a genre for this Mixtape."
"the settings button isn't were it should be (Library) (I also would like a way to select multiple songs, Playlist or albums so I can for example download all of them without having to kick on each one)"
"Absolutely love this app. However, wish you can remove a song from a playlist easier when it comes up. Such as a ""remove from current playlist button"""
"Even with the limitations on their library in my country Spotify still manages to deliver a great listening experience that's pretty satisfying overall. However, there are a few UI elements that I find annoying. For example why is the search option under liked songs hidden instead of having it directly above the list of songs like it is in the iOS version of Spotify. Hope you guys make that change soon."
"Absolutely fantastic. I just wish that I had discovered Spotify sooner. Love listening to such cool tunes, and incredible that they Taylor make days of tunes just to suit my taste in music. It,s like these guys really know me. I,m super impressed with Spotify. Magically great job guys. Thank you so much. It,s made a happy change to my life . No kiddin!"
"It is a very good app but I have some issues with this app and there are some songs that are unplayable like BTS ""ddaeng"", & Red Velvet's ""Peek a boo"" was not there that's why I'm soo furious that I can't play my fravrouite songs. So please I have a request that please fix the issues."
"simply love spotify but lately it's been moving a little slow when i go on to the app then into my music. It has never been like that, please restore quicker service!"
"The premium app is great: good sound quality, offline listening and the huge song database. However I gave only 4 stars (which is like 3.5) due to the fact that this app lacks a lot of gestures - you actually have to tap the song that is playing instead of swiping up to bring the song, same goes for minimising the song from fullscreen: you have to tap the icon which is on top left corner or press the back button - instead of swiping down like it would be normal (a pain for users with big screen)"
"I really wish that they added a quick easy way to queue songs. For example, on iPhones you can just swipe right on the song"
"I know it's quitely late to say this is an amazing music app. It's indeed not free since it require me to upgrade to premium member. But once I upgraded, I aint feel any regression. Good app"
Great selection of songs. Excellent search function. Save your favorite albums and songs. Can cast from your cell phone or tablet easily to your TV via Roku. Free service requires listening to some commercials every half hour but very tolerable versus listening to radio.
Best music app there is. Hands down. Spotify premium keeps me in the loop with all my favorite artists new releases and download at the tap of a button. What more could you want?!
The big update was not optimal but I've gotten used to it. I still miss my 'Recently Played'. The app still has a nice design but I miss the old Spotify.
"After being using the app for a while I was very pleased by the songs recommendation algorithms, it simply suggests the next song that fits perfectly, whatever the genre mood... 5 bucks a month is quite reasonable due to free options but royalties are a must. I love it! Thank you."
"When it comes to streaming music and podcasts. This is the best app. Can pretty much find everything I want, and its a clean design."
"I've use Spotify for the best part of 10 years. Cant fault it, the user experience day one was great and it has only improved."
"The type of app that I've been dreaming of since childhood. Great quality with regards to music, variety and design of the app. Only downside is that it's sometimes laggy on Android system."
"Great app. You can listen to music anywhere and create your own playlists. The only problem is the ads. Some of them are quite long, and it keeps pushing you to get premium."
Its a little hard to get around. Still not really that intuitive. Great playlists though. The moving backgrounds are really cool.
"please add Playback Speed. i really love this app and paid for this. im using this for guitar practicing songs but when a particular song is fast, i push myself to use other music app just to keep that particular song part in slow speed. so please, can you add Playback Speed?!"
"The algorithms for finding music beyond what I listen to can be quite impressive, especially when I'm looking for new things to listen to. It's not perfect but it hits the mark more often than not."
Spotify isn't as feature packed as other music apps but damn me if it isn't really good at what it does. Recommendations are always on point & playback is fluid and stutter free with minimal or no buffering time even when I'm using it on data. You can seamlessly switch playback from one device to other which just seems magical. Other music apps with all their features rarely recommend music that match my taste as well as Spotify does which is all that matters really. 10/10 would listen again
Awesome all around. Dropped music for like a week once. But was quickly fixed. I recommend it to everyone. I have the family plan. Super worth it.
"It's rare to get such a good experience from an app. I use it everyday, and after a month I'm still finding features that are intuitive and useful."
Overall great app but please bring back the widget. Quality of life has been greatly decreased. I can still use the app but removing the widget removed my ease of access. It is the equivalent of pooping without toilet paper. Functionally you can still poop but you will have a hard time trying to wipe your butt. üí©
"I have had a wonderful time with this app, very easy to use! I also had a problem with my account being taken by another person at one point, the support was easy to follow and they were quick to resolve the issue."
"I think Spotify has every song ever writen. they say if a billion aire ever droped an $100.00 bill. the time it would take to bend over and pick it up, well he would lose money... now if Spotify ever stopped and tried to count their songs that they own, they could build a rocket and fly a man to mars and back before before they would finish counting."
"great selection of music. simple and easy to use interface. would give 5 stars if they just fix it being quiet over bluetooth. 3rd phone with spotify, every one same story I have to turn up my volume to about 30% higher than any other app."
"I am in LOVE. Spotify is loyal, trustworthy, and rarely quits. It provides me with all my necessary music fixes and then some. It knows me. üòÇ thanks Spotify."
"the service itself is excellent. It's not quite 5 stars though because Spotify does not have live stations like Apple Music, which would make it 6 stars. Get ON IT Spotify!"
Great source for a variety of music. After learning from a friend in the buisness that spotify actually supports the artists I can't recomend it enough.
"I love this app, it's absolutely brilliant. HOWEVER I'm a bit frustrated with there being so many explicit songs ... adding the radio edit/non-explicit versions would earn 5 stars for sure! With having young ears around, and quite honestly the preference not to listen to the explicit versions, there's quite a few great songs we can't choose üò¢"
An excellent app. I was directed towards Spotify by my workers several months ago and use it when I'm driving in the country. I have a good selection of my favourite songs in my library which is easily accessible with the touch of a few buttons. Highly recommend it.
i love this app so much and i am a premuim user. i keep updating the app and even re downloading it bucause it cuts the music off and switches song while in standby mode and even when i have the phone in my hand while im using it... if someone could help me fix this that would be great!
"Been using Spotify for a few years now. love the fact you can create and share your own play lists. Also the huge variety of music that I often dip into, exploring new genres. Only thing I have to be careful about is whilst teaching First Aid (CPR) to a group of school children. I went to play Staying Alive on my phone, ramping up the volume!!! Only to be puzzled why my phone was quiet. The text message off the scared to death wife at home, reminded me it was set to the wireless speakers...."
Multi-OS Compatible application (Mac / Windows / Linux / iOS/ Android) built with multi-sync feature and high quality audio tracks is one of the most desired apps that you'd wanna have if you are a true audiophile. The intermittent adverts do get annoying at times but well the premium plans don't tend to burn a hole in your pocket either. Absolutely recommend Spotify!
"The app updated itself while i was asleep and in the process, it removed its widget from my home screen and there is no sign of it anywhere to put it back. After logging a live chat with a very nice operative, it seems this might be an android issue but being caught early gives them a chance to hopefully fix it quickly. Other apps would benefit greatly from following their quality of service."
"This app is honestly the best, all song I want are there. The app works efficiently and effectively. Quality of songs provided is absolutely amazing. Does not require a lot of data usage üëåüëåüëå It also has beautiful playlists provided. Definitely press that INSTALL button It's worth it"
"Great app. Fluid, smooth but very difficult to find songs in search bar. Suggestions are just irrelevant."
"I wish that I could say that the app is worst and boring as M very ctitic abt any app but to my expectations and experience the app is very great in music catalogue; with ample of options you can customise your listing features, etc beyond. Best part is that youre having the advertisement for less than 15 sec for free versions which may be aftr an hour or so.. But this app can do better by (a)Premium version are very heavy on pockets(b)GUI improvements(c)offline in free versions(d)Battery saver."
great app. great selection. great features. TEDIOUS to build Your library. time consuming to build your library. needs more sweeping selection methods to add or remove albums or songs into and out of your library. similar to a PC being able to select multiple files(songs) or folders(albums) @ a time
"So...I never liked spotify and I thought it was pointless , but after I bought the premium it's much better , you can do so many things and you can listen to so many songs! I didn't give it 5 stars because I can't see all the songs of an artist (unless they have ""This is..."") and it's kinda annoying. Also , sometimes when I open other apps (like Instagram) Spotify closes you need yo fix that quick it's so annoying!! To sum up it's a very good application if you buy the premium!"
"Loading times can be retro-legth on some devices, taking you back all the way to the 90s. Otherwise mostly well designed app."
Very comprehensive catalogue. Suits my catholic taste down to the ground. Excellent quality of playback too. Good integration between mobile/tablet and smart TV apps.
"Great selection, smooth UI, ads are annoying if you don't have premium, and for some reason this recent update got rid of the spotify widget? I dunno."
"From the last update I'm having a issue, if I reply with a txt message or answer a call the music doesn't come back up quite frustrating to reopen the app and play it again."
I've had it for years. consider it to be well rounded when pitted against other music players. UI is pretty straight forward. There was one version that was hard to navigate at one point.
"There is a lot of beautiful music on this app. There's a vatiety of music, ranging from orcastral covers to pure rain to calm down. They don't skimp on youtube covers either, allowing my favorite creators a wider chance at being heard. Rock covers for video game music, a trio of pro guitarists! Not to mention, it's fun to guess which of your favorite songs will be put on next on your choosen playlist. The mood you have will bring out the next song you love. The randomness is fun in of its selfüòÄ"
Spotify is absolutely exceptional. It's customer service is always helpful and quickly resolved problems. I've had Spotify for years now and I don't see any other way
"i was hesitant about it. I have always bought my own music and i have hundreds of cds and multiple single songs from itunes. But I decided to give it a shot and i do not regret it at all! spotify is a quick way to find new music and it can tell you when new music from the artists you follow is out( aswell as if they are playing in a town near you). I do find the algorythm a bit sloppy at times though. if you can, i'd still reccomend buying the artists cds irl or other medias."
"I'm having the same issue as many other users due to the new Samsung update. The music will randomly stop, the buttons to change the song from the lock screen and widgets no longer work, and I can't use any other bluetooth connection (headphones and car speaker) to change songs. Please fix these issues"
"Awesome, but where's my widget? I just recently updated the app and the widget for Android phones is gone. Did Spotify get rid of it? Other than that, i love the app. so easy to navigate and get to music quickly.. even without my widget."
I got 3 months premium for 7 Euro on offer at the beginning of the summer and it has been worth it. My favorite way to stream music and podcasts as well as having the offline feature is great on premium. highly recommend if you are a frequent listner. you will definitely find something you like. the new ui is a bit of a hit or miss but overall ots great once you get used to it.
"Don't remove the widget. It makes changing songs quick and easy while working, cooking, bicycling. I use it all the time. That's the only reason for the 4 stars. Or I would have given it a 5"
it gives quite a wide spectrum of songs to choose from but there are songs that are available in other country's version of Spotify but not India's.
"The new update which messes about with the ""your library"" section feels disjointed and unpolished to say the least. It is bad enough that this redesigned area basically removes the recently played section but what it replaces with it is functionally inadequate. It now defaults to displaying playlists rather than the saved music library which adds unnecessary friction to the experience. Also, this update is incredibly poorly optimised, and slow. True garbage. Don't role the change out."
"Spotify is the best music app out there. I've been using it for years and it has been amazing for listening any music at any time. I only miss the quick buttons to sort and search a playlist, which was there in the past. Please bring it back! It would also be a great improvement if there were patch notes for each new release on each platform. I would like to know what has changed to the app I use everyday!"
"Excellent UI system, with brilliant music PLAYBACK. The connectivity between mobile, pc and web Spotify applications - the ability to pick up a song where you left off is really what drew me in. An amazing Playlist creation system, simple drag and drop songs on Spotify desktop. I emplore anyone looking for a quality music streaming service to give Spotify a try, it's worth it."
I just have one problem. The Instagram Stories share feature is not always available. It comes and goes as it pleases which is quite irritating so please fix this issue. Otherwise the app is amazing!
"Spotify is a super diverse music app. Besides minor bugs here and there, it runs smoothly 98% of the time and is quite useful for accessing a gigantic music library. Kudos to you Spotify!"
Spotify has always allowed me to listen to what I want and where I want with their Premium service. I also enjoy their recommended songs because they are genuinely what I like to listen to.
this is the best music playing app ive had i love being able tk listen 30 minutes of music without interruptions from ads be a little beter with an hour but i love how u can make and build your own group of songs i also like the dark theme aspect of the app this is bu far a great app
Somewhat better music selection than Amazon music. Not quite as intuitive as Pandora. More usage time will determine my go to music streaming platform.
"I am entirely happy with my use of Spotify. I don't tell friends and family to use certain apps much but Spotify is one I don't hesitate to share with everyone. Its so good its one of the few apps I actually pay to use. Its just a few bucks a month which gives me unlimited access from any device and the ability to control what I'm playing from one device while its playing on another. You can save music and artists you like, you can build playlists and share them! This is the service you want."
"Spotify is great! love the personalised recommendations the app throws up based on my listening preferences, that's cool. Good to see the vast library Spotify has built over the years, but has to be said - the Indian collection is rather poor. You need more, Spotify, you can't take over the Indian market with your current collection."
I love spotify Great selection of music and its user friendly. I have foynd and listened to sounds I hadnt heard in quite the minute and songs I heard yesterday. Also love the daily mix.
Has got the best ever algorithms for song suggestions. It almost knows more about the type of music that you like than ourselves. The UI is also slick and cool
The best app for music ! I like its feature where it curates playlist based on your artist selection and updates it daily. No need to search and create a playlist it will just generate it for you. Interface is quite simple to use so that is why I am rating it 5 stars. Good work team !
"love it discovered so many new bands! only complaint I have is I use it in my car a lot and I keep getting "" click now to watch a short video. and get 30 minutes of ad free music"" kinda a hassle to have a push button add when driving."
Best way to discover new music quickly. But the best of all is It creates different personalized playlists just for the user.
If you think pandora is so great and believe its true then try spotify premium just for the trial week. You'll see very quickly why Spotify blows them out of the water!! With seemless playback and equalizer seetings that outmatch google music and also rewind or fast forward as much as you want in a song to skip to the good parts or replay your favorite part?? Forget about it bro Spotify has it all!
"The app is good but the volume is quite low. For example, if I watched a song on YouTube and I listened the same song on Spotify, the volume is way more less than YouTube. Please fix these if possible & tbh, I downloaded this app because of it's peer pressure. Otherwise I was pretty used to my regular playlist on my phone's default music app."
I've switched from IOS to Android and one of the few things that made me regret the most is the fact that I can't swipe to queue on Spotify. Like this fact alone made me very upset as such a feature made life so easy with Spotify. Please hear our pleas as Android users who wanted to seperate from Apple's design redundancy and grant us our wish.
Technology what a awsome app every song i have chosen has been on it and the fact its quite easy to use makes it very convenient i like the bluetooth part !!play all my favourite songs from the palm of my hand
Spotify unfolds to be an outstanding and a marvellous music streaming application in India. I had been longly waiting for this jewel to release in India. As expected Spotify beats it! It has an amazing user flexiblity specifically more outrageous for its graphical UI. The Premium membership tends to be more decent when compared with Apple Music.
"using it for 3 years excellent ui, always getting upgraded and looking good tons of really cool and convinient features i'd love if they could return on their next update where i can see on any playlists how many songs there are in it, because it was romoved..."
"spotify is a great app, you may want premeium though. never takes long to download anything! great for quick stops. two suggestions i have are 1:having a timer, personally i like to listen to music while i sleep, but i dont want it on all night, a timer to shut the music off would be great. 2: mabey make the music able to play without the app being open in your tabs/backround, just suggestions! from: a thrilled user!"
"Amazing app, well designed and good presentation, good service and listening qualitie. In my experience, it's probably better than apple music, because of personalization features or maybe of more setting options, also because of the capability of connect this app with all the smart environment. This is just an opinion, if you give a chance to Spotify, you will live a unique experience."
"The app is great. I enjoy using it. But i was thinking at one thing. When i search music it will be awsome to search a song in the app like on shazam. i hate when i hear a new song, use shazam then go to spotify and search again. maybe a new button on search section üòÅ"
"Excellent service! Just needs a better way to filter your liked tracks as it is a bit clunky to need to hit menu button in order to search for songs you like. This used to exist, but was removed. I used the feature often to filter a playlist by a particular artist."
"Love the versatility Spotify has with its options, amazing interface and very simple to understand. I wish there was customizable options for the music player UI but thats my only gripe! :)"
spotify is so great. nearly perfect. it seems like the shuffle button doesn't truly shuffle your library. I have thousands of songs saved and usually hear the same two or three hundred.
"this is the best music app i have ever used ;the recommendations and radios are awesome, but i have recently encountered some issues if there is an advertisement and we multitask with the button the ad wont go away even if we click cancel and it would instead controll the background one other small issue is that when you flip your phone it will go to landscape mode and pop right back to portrait mode spotify lite has landscape mond so why not the standard version?"
"Great app, great service but the UI could be more responsive and the new search(with recomendations) kind of sucks, because you have to click one more time to get the actual search bar The UI is changed too often. Followed artist aren't categorized alphabetically."
"Spotify premium is possibly the best music streaming app there is. It features almost all artists out there, isn't limited to just english songs, and has all the best features you'd want from a streaming app. youve got playlists that make themselves, daily mixes made from what you listen to, a release radar, and even a dj mode where the songs merge into one another. And lets not forget an in built sleep timer for when you're falling asleep. I love spotify."
pretty good. only a couple of issues with dropping service and I'm not certain if that was because the building security since other's were having similar issues.
"This app is always overlooked by the general population as being one of the best designed apps around because its now a necessity! It doesnt feel like a third party app, it feels like it was designed with your phone!!!"
"If its ok can u guys add on phones to go restart on song like on tablet and computer, and the back button so u can go back to other songs. Because i have a fav song and it ends the next song plays, but i really wanna go back to it but i cant. So if u can make it to where we can for phones then thats great. Besides that i love this app its amazing."
I would give five stars but there are quite a few remixes and covers that are very popular and spotify does not have them. This may be due to a liscencing or copyright issue but if it is a simple oversight i would love to see it corrected.
"I just wish they had more obscure songs on here. But other than that, love it!!! The more you listen and like, the better the playlists that are built for you. Great for finding new music."
"so they've done a great job with the Podcasts side. which was my gripe in a past review. UI has changed quite a bit but search is really good, and can search for songs, artists and podcasts. I'm happy paying the monthly fee because its great"
This app is awesome if you have premium. So worth the extra mulla to have your playlist and awesome relevant suggested music to make your playlist feel fresh building on your original music! 10 out of 10 would recommend‚úå
Great music app to find new spirit rising music of different genres across various artists... It has a nice intuitive UI w/ dark theme... Creates a nice background when sharing our favorite music through stories... NIFTYüòÅ
"Finally, it's available in India. Really like the fact that they made more features available in the free version for Indians, basically makes the app fully usable for free. And the subscription fees are also quite affordable, esp their student plans; for no ads and offline saving capability it's a really good deal. Kudos to the team behind Spotify. My only request is that they expand their library, which I'm sure they do so no complains here. 5 stars from me ‚úåÔ∏è"
"This is fantastic. Able to listen to any artist, song or album and save it for later. being able to pick and choose the songs for your own playlist is amazing. Ive been looking for this kind of a service for quite some time. Highly recommended!"
"Samsung S10 : the videos are annoying (does anyone actually use that feature, no one I know does), frequently requires me to unlock phone so spotify can reconnect to internet, but still the best music/podcast app out there"
intuitive app that introduces the user to new music they wouldn't have otherwise probably find. I know I wouldn't find what spotify presents to me consistently!
"Great app, better than any of its Indian rivals. The music suggestion engine is far better than any other app. Also the custom suggestions aren't there in any other app. Have been waiting for its launch in India. They surprised us with their quick launch and support for south and north Indian songs."
"Love this app, don't understand what everyone is on about with difficult UI. All seems incredibly simple to me. I have premium and can access everything easily and select anything I want to play specifically with the play queue. I haven't experienced any crashing issues and only crashes rarely at a frequency equal to all my other apps (more phone issues than the app). Love the ease of using speakers but it is a shame I can't play synced music with other devices"
"The best music player, bar none. Clean UI, vast array of songs and awesome connectivity options. It would be even better if you added a Sleep functionality, which lets you turn off the player after a specified duration of time. edit: new update includes the sleep function as well. Awesome addition."
it's really fun to pick and listen to our fav music! then only thing is that I want is that they won't turn off the forward button if that's a fav song and we want to read listen to it! thats all other than that I love this app
"With the recent updates, its gotten a lot better. It's good to finally have a built-in sleep timer. I haven't got any other complaints apart from using the bluetooth in my car. I like to listen to songs on repeat a lot, and that function disappears in the car. Other than that, I'm very satisfied."
literally the best music app for all you music lovers out there.... it has a very good UI and is extremely easy to use... has great quality music and album art... definitely the best of the best....
"Everything works properly and the ""Daily mix"" makes everyday just perfect for me. But I can't find the repeat or shuffle buttons though it's available in other countries."
"I pay premium and despite what people say, its defintly better for listing to music without a bijillion diffrent ads every 30 minuites. defintly recommed spotify and its premium feature.üòâ"
I've had spotify for a very long time and I love it but it recently updated and i no longer have the button for 30 minutes of ad free music. Im also a little dissapointed that there are so many ads now and when you get 30 minutes of add free music its a lie because it plays like 5 ads then after 4 songs it plays andother add if my issue could be fixed that would be great
Great mix of music. One thing I would like is a way to export listening history (e.g as a csv or spreadsheet). This would allow easy collation of podcast listening for things like continuing professional development.
I should thank spotify for breaking my song listening pattern. I have now started to listen to other genres besides Rap and Hip hop. I love the UI and collection of songs of course.
"App is great, battery consumption is quite high though even when not in use and putting it to sleep doesn't allow for proper background playback."
"its very wasy to use, also provides you a variety of songs of your own choice. loved the presentation of graphics as compared to other music apps ."
"Resisted getting Spotify for so long... then eventually caved. It's great for random playlists, and probably perfect for those willing to pay Premium. Just sad that it doesn't have every album by every artist quite yet. Maybe that will come with time. Excellent app though."
"I wake up in the morning and can hear happy birds chirping and the sound of happy memories from people walking by and... I open Spotify and drown out all that happy with some mega volume SAD BUT TRUE by METALLICA and revel in the dark shadows of my own pit of despair and feel the rage inside turn into sounds of pure bliss. Nothing Else Matters!! I bow to you Lord Spotify and your powers of awesomeness!!! Peter. J. Moore. "" Can't ubiquitous forlorn "" 'sc ream' - 1978-2019 - when the bell tolls"
Best music streaming service. Intuitive design and constantly adding new features. Only gripe is I wish there were more swipe gestures on Android like there is on iOS
"Just started my premium subscription today after a few weeks of continually using the free experience. Satisfied so far. Good work Spotify. I do think $12 a month is slightly higher than I'd really like to pay. Let's see how many playlists I can make during my trial I guess EDIT: Can you add a ""play next"" button. So it adds the item to the start of the Queue rather than the end. This would be a perfect feature for Spotify as I am someone that constantly queues songs and albums all day long"
"Best app for people who love music. I love music, I love convenience and it lacks nothing.. Best user experience, intergrates well will smart devices, and after service has been great..üíôüëç"
"Pls bring back the option where you can search the song in the album or the Playlist. I'm lazy.. Okay.. The filter search, I think thats The one... The search bar in the Playlist so you can search the song in that Playlist. Bring it back.. Cmon... But this app is good. The juicy stuff.fantastic.... No problem with. Execpt the search bar, the one I'm saying before"
"I haven't had quite the issues other users have but removing the playlist count was a big misstep. Also, adding your own playlist photo should be allowed. Another big name streaming app allows it"
"You remove Radio, my playlists can't be sorted on mobile and my recently played can't be found easily. Moreover, there's no quick option to enable Private session."
So much more customized than Pandora. play list options are awesome. so far Library is on point and the daily and weekly recommended artists match the genre's I listen to the prior week. Running into old artist's i forgot about & discovering new ones i probably wouldn't otherwise run into working 45-50 hours a week. Apple music an Google Music aren't quite there yet.
"app is great. Being in india cant find this much english songs at any other app so its great, uses less data, UI is ok not that great, there should have been an option to change sequence of song in your playlist like if the song is at 10th place in playlist we could change it to 1st or any other place,Thanks"
"I used spotify online, which lead to the correct version for linux. If your using linux its not the easiest to get up and running but a decent service when its working."
"Its a good app,tho i cant listen to the music i want when i search it up i can only seem to be able to listen to a preview of the song,i find this quite annoying."
"The music quality is great ! Any playlist can be found in spotify . Although there is advertisement but the condition is fair enough because after advertisement, you'll get to stream 30 minutes of music without ads interruption. But there is an issue I'd like to report , it's about the ads that needs to be close . Those ads just won't close when I press the 'DISMISS' or the 'x' button. Please fix this bug ASAP becuase I'm gettin' real sick of it. Thank you !"
"Dont want to be dramatic or anything, but this is the very best app in the entire universe! The sync betweet devices, the personalization, the UI. everything is just convenient and pleasant! I LOVE YOU Spotifiy!!"
Great app but missing a couple of options. Would really like to be able to search my library based on genre enabling me to make a quick playlist based on my mood.
best music streaming app. basicly like having every song ever made at the press of a button. great quality never have any issues. well worth paying for the monthly premium.
Best music interface yet. Could have a better way of making playlist quickly though. And it would be nice to reset all liked songs without deleting your library and saved songs.
"As a newbie to Spotify Premium I am agreeing to make an initial review of the application I am quietly impressed with the range of music offered within the genre definitions I have a very eclectic taste in music as a result of spanning many years exploring many genres. I do have a cultured ear, so I am rather fussy So far I have found Spotify to be consistent with such a fussy music fan such as myself"
music good quality and good selection. a better user interface is sorely needed. you need a stop and off buttons. its a nightmare to switch the thing off !! f
"It is definitely an amazing app and I strongly recommend it. There is a wide variety of songs,creators and playlists to try out! If you don't like inappropriate music then you can filter the songs that have strong words or suggestive phrases so that they can't be listened to. Also,the audio is fluid and smooth. You can make your own playlists made of songs you like! Spotify most certainly deserves 5 stars! I Strongly recommend Spotify for music lovers."
"Fantastic app. Music quality is great, the UI has high usability. It's easy to search for a particular song, or artist as well as the creation of playlists is very easy. The Downloading of songs is very good as you can change the sound quality level of your music. Overall a excellent app."
"I love the recent change to Loved songs and albums! I regularly experience UI hangs that aren't freezing, nor do they seem to be related to data connection, as it happens on wifi and cell. Sometimes clearing cache helps, but not always."
"one of the most fluid music platforms, wish more integrations with other great platforms could be made, but all in time, still one of the best ways to listen to tour favorite artist and find new music"
"The app is totally for a good music experience.it has such a beautiful UI.The recommended content,albums,trending are so accurate and up to dated.Guys do go for this one if you realy want a perfect experience of music.!"
please make it more seemless to use the library by giving back the pull down to filter/search bar. having to go look for the search function is poor app design at its peak
"Hey Spotify team, your app is just amazing üëçüëçüëç.After my account on JioSaavn got deleted, I was searching for a nice music app and this is just perfect. I've been using it for almost a week in my dad's phone and now I downloaded it in my phone as well. It works quite smoothly. There are no problems till now and even the music quality is very good. Thanks for such an amazing app üòç"
"Good application and service, although it has rather confusing UI (also on desktop). There is a list of songs being played, but the is also a separate play queue. at different times these have different priority, which means is sometimes hard to play the song you actually want to hear..."
"Great for music if looking for a free music app, the ads you can understand, and all the buttons are displayed pretty good. Overall, a nice app."
"I love spotify, yeah it may have a few downfalls.. but, for a free app, it truly is amazingly convenient. It offers so much and the premium prices are surprisingly reasonable. Although the ads you receive for premium do become quite repetitive, that's just something you have to deal with I suppose. Besides that I really do believe this app deserves five whole stars."
"Great music, there isn't a song I haven't been able to find. The app however is wonky, navigating the song que is quite strange. Regardless, the quality of music availability demands 5 stars."
Great music and fantastic playlist. The only drawback is not being able to put artist in alphbetical order or by genre. Which would make it easier to make my own personal playlist. But I am LOVING it. I am strongly thinking about becoming Premium real soon after I build my library.
"awesomeness. spotify has podcasts, linguistic training, and of course music. spotify gives you so much more for less than what many other subscriptions cost."
No better music streaming app built yet. Although I'd love if there were an option to add a new song I just searched to queue while I am already listening to the previous song.
the new update kinda sucks. I wish they would go back to the last layout. My artists arent in alphabetical order and it's difficult easily find who I'm looking for quickly. I have to slowly scroll through reading every name instead of just scrolling quickly to the first letter of their name and them being right there
"Just started to use the service and am liking it a lot so far. Great range of genres, lets you build your own playlists that you can take wherever you go."
I on family premium right now. Im using data connection on my phone. I got a problem or q system bug. I already turned on download wifi settings still off is showing. Fix this cant download song. Your button is useless
"Fantastic application whether on desktop or mobile, however it's very tiring when they basically do a full makeover of the UI. It's really annoying that I need to re learn where to find everything. Pick a layout and stick with it please."
"Really liking Spotify, but the new UI sucks. As long as I can listen to all my songs though it's fine, and I don't really care."
Great for all situations. Links up with discord and all devices with widgets and built in functionality. lacks slightly with the way in which if you have a rolling contract that all your downloaded songs can dissapear if you catch it on the wrong day and has slightly less bitrate quality than can be found with apple music but is a fantastic deal for students and greater customisability than all other apps. Would benefit from a party or group function to ad songs on the fly to a queue.
"Free version is awful by design, forcing ads and no way to turn off shuffle. But the paid version is absolutely worth it, I use it every day to play my favorite music and find new music and podcasts. Its Spotify. you know what it is."
"It is a great app, with better UX than most apps (including the most popular apps). It is easy to get a hang off, and easy and quick to use. The inability to quickly save songs and queue songs (like when on the run), at least on Android, does make it a lot more annoying. In general, I wish the Android widget wouldn't be so awkward, and it is hard to find previous songs you've heard on all the different versions."
"Discover Weekly is usually good once the app knows what you like. I find a song or two almost everytime, but the UI needs improvement. Spotify also needs to find a balance between promoting new acts, the classics, and popular mainstream artists. Too much mainstream music sometimes."
"What can I say apart from this app is totally the best way to listen to your favourite music. Spotify is simply mind blowing. very good job Devs keep up the fantastic work, music to suit everyone's taste"
"I was waiting for this app for quite a long time and now when it finally got released in India, I downloaded it . Plus , the app has various list of artists and songs, which is awesome.üëç"
"Excellent UI, Excellent Sound Quality. Purchased premium on day 1 of usage. But I loved the previous logo of Spotify without the black border. The newer one is not as attractive as earlier one."
Overall probably the best in it's category. What I would like: - more podcasts (i.e. thoseincluded in Google assistant service) - ability to see lists and playlists on car infotainment systems - ability to mark several songs in a list/playlist (not having to select an option for each song separately- annoying when tried to unlike 89 songs...) - inbuilt equalizer to work in all devices despite the fact that a device may have it's own.
app is good but it's better when there are basic options like repeat button available in free version and plus music from all artist are still lacking I'm spotify if these problems were resolved then this app be the best free music streaming service across the globe
"The best music service, with great device support, excellent quality, and a fast, clear app. The designers and development team should be proud."
Once you get premium the ads go away and its wonderful. The app makes daily playlists based on you music taste as well which helps find new music and builds your own personal playlists.
Amazing app but the UI needs a lot of work to make the UX better. And you guys really need to listen to the suggestions of the users on your feature message boards better.
"As one who makes playlists by him self, it has been easier then ever. Not to complex as the UX is just right - even with the driving mode! I personally love how high quality the music is and I love that about of YouTube musicians use as I can listen to their music in it."
amazing app however there is a requirement of adding more songs asap although they have been promised. One can discover more artists on Spotify as compared to other apps. Therefore 4/5.
"I've been using Spotify for over 5 year. It's very intuitive. Although I'm not a fan of the new layout, I will continue using it. I also wish that they would work out a deal with Jay Z so i could listen to his music on this platform"
always found any song. think the GUI could be improved for finding tracks seem to be swiping alot maybe smaller icons or a flow chart approach.
"Of all the music streaming apps, Spotify is the only one the cares about the overall user experience. I have been a premium member since 2012, and I will always be one!"
"Spotify app (paid) is better than the others I feel. crashes less and or easy to navigate. The suggestion engine is much better than others (such as tidal/deezer/apple/youtube for example), it's a fun experience to check out new stuff. The overall audio quality is okay however the spotify applied pre audio sampling isn't really built for heavy metal. I was hoping for flac quality though, or the ability to stop the minor fade-in with tracks."
"The app is great for most devices, but sometimes there are technical issues when you connect it to your car via Bluetooth or other apps designed for it"
Love the UI and song selection process. And most of the songs are available in every country. Not region or country restricted like others. So love it.üòò
"Manually turn Car View ON I love that there's a Car View mode. Makes navigating through songs so much easier while driving. But the problem is, why isn't it available for AUX cable users?! That's pretty absurd if you ask me. So only cars with Bluetooth can drive more safe? Please include a manual toggle in the next update. For safer driving! I've suggested this already in Ideas too so if anyone is on there, do give my idea a vote up! üòä"
"1. Sometimes, after the ad is over a pic of the ad is displayed on top of screen of app and it freezes with the buttons showing 2 buttons(""Watch Now"" and below that ""Dismiss""). If I swipe or click or do whatever on the screen the screen works for everything except the ad. I can swipe up/down playlists, click on the now playing tab The ad does not display when Im on the Now Playing screen, but on moving to Home, it displays. I can't remove it unless I restart the app! 2. Add a queue Please help."
"I really like the weekly personalized mixes, the genre separated daily playlists, among the fact that until now there was no song that I couldnt find on spotify ( direct linking with Shazam is great ). The things i dont like are: 1. that the button to save songs for offline mode is sometimes really hidden 2. with locked screen ( Android - S10 ) the buttons should be bigger, hard to switch songs."
spotify has almost every song i eant to listen to except for some japanese anime songs which i like to hear now i can't even access my music anymore due to whatever you did to my songs it was alot easier just to push library button hit songs and my music played pls fix problem by morning need my music
"I have tried them all and SPOTIFY is the hands-down winner for the streaming quality, content selection, dashboard, graphics and of course, VALUE. The onboard EQ with Dolby Atmos is 9/10. Very efficient use of our Mobile Data, also. Six licenses for everyone in the house. $14.99 per month. Four adults in my house...SPOTIFY is the only thing we mostly all agree onüòÑüôàüôäüôâ"
"WAY better than Pandora. Search your fav artists and hear full albums, not just one song in a sea of other recommended artists songs. With Spotify I've built a playlist for every mood and activity."
"Overall good experience. However, its missing 'Shuffle' option in playlist. Its the basic required feature in any music player app."
"Loving this app! The recommendations are wonderfully suited to my taste and mood. I came from Google Play Music, which is great in its own right, but lacked the fluidity of Spotify."
"spotify is a wicked music app, worth paying for, i share it between 2 devices as long as ones not connected to the internet i can listen on both or if im connected to a stereo via AUX i can use the second device to change the song! i also have it connected to my ps4 and can control the app from my phone to play off my console, it also has a great selection of music, not all of the songs i want are there but they have wide band of differnt genres"
Love how the new functionality came through. Still would like some updates to the UI for one handed friendly use. The options menu while in a playlist or on a song to be relocated to the bottomof the screen. Can be switched with the device option that's bottom left. That isn't used as the functionality in the options menu list.
"I really like Spotify. Quick to access, very nice quality and a broad range of music, theme songs, and even old radio shows too an extent. I recommend it!"
love the new app design. very well organized and easy to find the songs/podcasts I want to listen to. easy to find new songs too!
great for building and finding good playlists to listen to on the road. pretty wide selection of music. the experience isn't too bad without premium either.
"All music exists on this software. For $10/mo you can literally steal the soul of all the great masters of every genre of music from the beginning of recorded music. The 3 major label conglomerates take most of the money, leaving only crumbs for the writers and performers. It's a great way to find the music you love, even make playlists for offline play, but for Christ's sake, if you love an artist, find other ways to support them. Buy some designer vinyl, go to shows..."
It's a very good streaming service. it seems to have a few over sites in its design compared to the iOS version of Spotify like you you need to use a menu to search through a playlist rather than scrolling to the top of the page but has been steadily getting improvements over the last few years
Tried all other music streaming services but nothing compares to Spotify UI and their algorithms to select music based on what I've already listened to. 5*
"I recently moved from Google Play to Spotify after it was launched in India and till now it has been a great experience. I specifically like its mac app and recommendations. They can somewhat improve on search. Unlike YouTube music, you are required to type exact name of the bollywood songs which sometime becomes irritating."
"everything is good, music base, UI, everything, just add one thing in it. thumbnails beside the songs. it feels very cumbersome to identify songs when i want to listen ASAP"
it's one of the best music streaming services out there. I loved how they have a vast library and personalized playlist that always suit my taste. loved it
"Really clean design, good music quality. And I absolutely LOVE the recommended music Playlist. It changes every monday and curates new music for me so I don't have to search."
Easy and intuitive way to navigate music. The suggestions based off what you listen to are great.
"Excellent Library, regardless of taste. Interface is intuitive. i would prefer better playlist making options."
"Would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the new UI. Also, artists can no longer be sorted alphabetically. Just made Spotify look so complicated. i hope they fix this. The previous UI was sooooo much better and is very user friendly. was expecting an upgrade but boyyy was that a downgrade lol"
"I'm now happy with the app, but I would redesign the UI to show more content other than music. It's quite hard to find it and it's hilarious that is the case nowadays."
I like the playlists and free music. The commercials aren't bad. They're less frequent than broad cast radio. Premium is required for downloads/offline playing.
"The only issues I have a quirky things. Like clicking on an artist and it goes to the screen with nothing showing, or I switch apps for half a second and it shuts down, then takes a while to reboot. Overall I am very satisfied."
very nicely designed app with consistently updated options. ive never not found a song on spotify but spotify does make money through their premium membership so without that you cant play specific songs on demand
officially the best music app for international music. wide variety and range of different genres of music. all popular singers writers producers. genuinely authentic app UI. new equaliser is absolutely amazing. song fades into the next song which is quite amazing when you are listening to music.
"I LOVE Spotify! I'm cheap and don't like to pay for things, but this is a must and I gladly pay every month for years now. I can find any song I'm looking for and it's connected to Shazam so I can quickly add a song to a play list. I also love that I can share song on other platforms. Spotify gets 5 stars from me!!"
"Spotify, id be so lost without you! have had premium service now for about 7 years and it covers everything i need from genre to suit my mood or alter my mood - to almost every artist you follow or just cant get enough of . Tells you where all your fav artists next gigs are and for 11.99 a month you have non stop music without annoying ads. it is playable across all your devices at same time and can have family accounts also if you had one bill payer and multiple Spotify users in same house!!!"
"PLEASE FIX!!!! i have premium and my downloaded music keeps undownloading, where i need to keep connecting to wifi for it to re-download. I'm connected to wifi every day so it's not that 30 day thing. it's quite annoying and I'm travelling soon and don't want half my music to disappear before my flight. I've got a samsung s8+ with all updated software."
"the the only reason I'm not giving this app five stars is that once you have a lot of songs in your library, it is rather difficult sometimes to find them alphabetically they are stored in the order in which you acquire them, which can be cumbersome."
"Its a great app to use for music/podcasts etc. I had an issue with my login but the customer service team sorted it out quickly. The only 2 annoying things would be that not all types of music are available (may not be spotifys fault) I have also have had issues where my downloaded playlists are ""not downloaded"" out of the blue, which means I have to redownload them which can time consuming. Other than that, I have been a customer since 2013 and I use this app almost everyday :)"
"Great!! Love the ability to download music, and use this on any device! I just wish it had the lyrics of the song in a drop down bar, that would be quite nice"
"It even works offline... Couldn't ask for much more. I would like to offer a suggestion for something others may like as well however. I would really like a reliable alarm clock built into the app. Maybe add a feature like ""wake up to this song"", that prompts you to set up an alarm etc. Thanks,"
"The ""offline"" status toggle in the android pull down menu has disappeared. It was such an easy way  to change to offline mode for a brief periode (e.g. When someone at home started listening Spotify on Google home or when on a train,..). You just had to pull down the notification menu and in the easy acces buttons there was a ""offline"" button. Now it's gone. Anybody else having this issue?"
Spotify is great for when you want music on the go. The suggested weekly playlists makes it seem like Spotify knows exactly the kind music you want to hear to suit your mood.
"It's really good,I enjoy listening while reading watty srories but something change and I don't like it.My playlist change and when I press the play button,only the chorus will play."
a Good Listening Experience and I can Discover new songs that is considered under my taste of music. It's great overall just needs a few tweaks in the UI to make it more Appealing
Is there a way to toggle Car Mode manually? My app won't toggle to Car Mode automatically when it connects to my car's Bluetooth. It's not a car with built in Bluetooth. I'm using the Anker Roav Bolt.
"Had Spotify for quite some time now, even got to take advantage of the free Google home mini at the time. Great programming behind the app, clever and concise."
Good app even without premium you can build playlists and listen to the music that you want it does not have all of the groups that I would like but it still is a good app.
"I live for this app, it's really cool! I recomend to get premium right away if you only use it on a phone just because you won't be able to listen to the song you want but the one the shuffle picks for you and for PC user, the only bad part are the ads but it's not that bad. premium is quite nice you can listen to it without internet if you download playlist! I recommend 100%."
"love the UI and simplicity of it. collection and playlist is lovely, fact that one can remove a song from playlist is something great. podcast sets this one apat."
My favorite music source! Quite possibly couldn't function without it. The Spotify premium benefits are so worth it and the price is reasonable! Love this app
"Good for discovering new music based on what you like, otherwise it's not that useful and inconvenient. I want to play my list only without random music being thrown in it,that would make me much happier.The ads definitely ruin the experience,as they're badly placed"
i have to stay that this my #1 recommendation for a music app . It Consist of almost every song in the world + its ui experience seem to be user friendly but their is some fix had to be taken the in ui for better experience.
"Intuitive and easy to use. It converted me, an aging vinyl dinosaur, into a digital diva within days. I know now what all the young folks were making a fuss over."
"It is so great that I can listen to my poscasts and music on the same app. You may have had problems starting podcasts that have been around for forever and are super long. If you want start from their beginning, there's a sorting button that allows you to sort each upload descending and ascending by date."
"Fantastic app I use it daily for long bus travels and car trips and gaming on my Xbox. The UI is amazing although sometimes unresponsive and the audio quality is outstanding, I do wish we were able to customise it however even if it was a premium feature where we could add bass or reduce bass or even add treble or change the dynamics that would be cool to see In the future"
"as a premium customer, i really love the simplicity and user experience of this app. However on downloaded songs, would love to have filter by language and genre options."
I love the app itself. The UI is uncomplicated and it's easy to discover new music. One star deducted because on Android the app is glitchy. There is constant crashing and the music will stop playing at random and require an app restart.
I have been using this app for years. I have tried other apps but i resort back to Spotify. I have only had one issue with and that was a certain artist wouldn't play. When I contacted them they quickly fixed it and were super nice!
"very quick on gettin new releases.Very easy to download, the offline player works great and I really enjoy how spotify watches how I play my music and what music I play and makes me personal playlist."
Always great sound clean gui. I do hear from very well respected and much loved musicians feel you take too much cut for fronting them. Kinda counterproductive to the music scene on the whole. We need more music not less please look at this from your highrise. twang
"Never really had a chance to freely experience music until this app. It works great and it's nicely intuitive, gives me what I wanted quickly and easily! The amount of artist and music is absolutely amazing! Its been my most used app as of late."
My favorite aspect of Spotify is the song radio. Their software is extremely intuitive and I always find new music that I love in the generated playlist. So many absolute bangers!
"it's nice. not a huge fan of the UI, but definitely love the podcast they have. Just switched from iTunes, getting used to interface."
"been using for 3 years now perfect, albums released on time every time, no delay, good quality had 1 issue about a month ago where my songs were skipping without me pressing the button, but after a re install its running good as new"
"thanks spotify for the great music. just one issue with samsung galaxy S10e users, the shortcut button to toggle online and offline mode is not working.. anyway to resolve this issue? thank you."
Great if you have a premium account like me but the ads quickly ruin the whole experience especially when it makes you watch an ad for 30mins ad free music and then it plays 1 song and another ad. A nice large selection of all types of artists however you may find if difficult to find some classics and such and the playlists share is diabolical and don't get me started on the basically none existing ability to find a friends playlist even with the playlist name and your friends account name.
"Excellent app. Could find pretty much everything I looked for. Spotify support super nice and helpful, updates regularly and quite affordable. The default music app! Would be cool to be able to find more podcasts and audio books! P.S.: review based on paid subscription"
"Listen to music through Spotify all day every day. Works great most of the time, but sometimes disconnects when I stream through cromecast. The design of the latest update is hard to get used to, and I would love to be able to customize my view."
"Essential Entertainment. I link my Spotify account to all my devices, and enjoy access to a huge library of music to suit every mood, wherever and whenever I want. I have complex PTSD, and the ability to focus on the music is sometimes the only way to get through an attack. Spotify also makes it easy to share songs with my friends."
"A streaming service like nothing before its time. A revolution in music listening, for good and bad. Artists get worked over initially but get but promotion, and discovery than ever before...fair? Not sure. But it is here to stay and the app looks great and designed well too. Cheers"
Excellent app. like the app very much...my suggestion is add refresh button so we can interact to our song that we've searched for. Thank you. user interface is amazing ‚ô•Ô∏èüëåüèº
The superior music streaming platform. The app is super intuitive and the song/playlist recommendations are on point. 10/10.
I'm really enjoying this app a lot with all the default playlists to suit every mood and other stuff. It would be great if it displayed the lyrics too along with every song.
An awesome app. Its UI is the best for any music streaming app. Would've given it 5 stars if it could buffer less in areas with slow networks. Cheers!!
The UI is pleasing to look at and it is easy to find songs and other content you like. The app's own recommendations aren't too bad either.
"Wonderful app. My favorite of all the mainstream music streaming services. Premium is well worth the payment, and the new UI is beautiful."
"SPOTIFY IS, MUSIC STREAMING SUPREMECY. CRITICISM; adding a track to several playlists(P.L.) requires tedious repetition, becoming a major reduction to app fluidity. PLEASE, DEVS, give us a solution. [e.g.(in song options/add song to P.L.)(*longpress P.L. tile*/=enables=*tap to select multiple tiles*)] plz&thx"
"This app has the most wide ranged songs and the playlists are great. However, in the Indian version there is no shuffle button for specific playlists."
"I love to listen to every jondra of music out in the world today and Spotify always has the music I seek. At times I flash back to my era of R & B Music and it takes me back to my good old days, which heals me. You place your request and up pops your request. Not only that, it builds up your library and reminds you of what artist's albums you've played, which saves you the time of having to search for it again. And a plus, it Show Cases all the album's that artist is credited for."
"The only thing I can really think of to add is that when I put a song on repeat I want that to carry over to when I go to the next song instead of having to hit the ""play on repeat"" button again."
"Ads are the worst, but its really nice being able to preview the music and like some songs to help build up your library."
I love spotify. it's there whenever I need some music to suit my mood. easy to navigate and loads of choice.
"Genuinely worth your subscription. Find anything you enjoy, create playlists, get amazing suggestions on what to add to those playlists, take your music everywhere for any occasion/event. Excellent compatibility between devices and services, easy customizable optimization menus, and lots of your favourite remixes from smaller artists. 10 out of freakin' 10"
This is a bug in android .. Steps to reproduce ... song is already playing in background mode... after some time I want to change the song.... I launched the app ad is displayed.. so I dismiss it... screen is updated to song details page and I click back.. again ad is displayed and henceforth it keeps on looping... Anyways I love the app.. just want it to be bugfree with best UX to all users. Adios
"I've been using it for a couple of years now and the thing I really like about it is that the app learns your taste of music and after a while you won't need to find the new music, music will come to you effortlessly. and there's this thing that would be to great implemented: when i shuffle my songs in the library, instead of randomly queuing up what to play next, it stabilizes the mood while randomizing, like putting together the songs with the same gerne."
"easy to use, enjoyable, and quite a complete song bank. The down side is that if you're a free to use, prepare for ads and frustrating shuffles"
"having been very skeptical, I have found this app to be so intelligent. The quick order in which my playlists have come together and the overall accessibility. An excellent experience, and I, like you, just love my music!"
Almost the design and User Interface is very good and High Quality Songs too. but there is no Lyrics option. I hope that feature will exists in the upcoming update. ü§©
"I love spotify. it's the go to music app. be careful if you have a play button on your headphones or earphones. if you click it and you currently aren't playing something, spotify will start playing music. that is the only reason why I'm giving it a 4."
"Generally a good app but not always intuitive to use. also, I wish spotify would state what the changes are in their updates instead of just saying making improvements, bug fixes etc."
I was a long time user of Pandora before I was recommended Spotify. I fell in love with the UI immediately and the musical selection is as wide and bipolar as me!
Spotify has always been great. The interface is so user friendly and it's way superior than other streaming apps designwise and in catalogue.
All algorithms are not the same! Of the music apps only Spotiy seems to do more than devine my general demographic and then unerringly feed me hits from the year i graduated high school. Spotify gets me. Spotify figured out that i like Mongolian garage rock of the 60s and Miles Davis and Willie Nelson and Congolese chants and Penguin Cafe Orchestra and 70s kraut rock and Nancy Sinatra and obscure and early blues recordings.
love it.. what more can I say... tonnes of great music and if you dont mind ads its totally free.. can build huge playlists of favourite songs and then just shuffle play and let it do its thing..
Very good. But the download to listen offline is kind of confusing and complicated. I wish Spotify can have a download button for each song which makes thing easier.
After the last update the design of the app has been improved significantly but some usability changes are horrible such as I need a 3 step process to search for a song in liked songs (on IOS you just pull down the list and a search bar appears) on here you need to push a 3 dot menu then push search for a song and finally after that type the title. This is just time consuming and not user friendly. Please just change it! Also I feel like that app start been more sluggish...
Great app. Easy to use. My one complaint is that the menu button is right next to the scroll bar so sometimes when you're trying to add a song to the queue you scroll instead.
Great app but could they move the dismiss button somewhere else for the ads. I keep clicking things behind the ads and they don't close down till I close the app
I switched over from Google Music. This is far simpler to use and its very intuitive. It creates all my play lists for me.
"Surprised at how well this app was able to find music I liked. Easy to make playlists. Ads are quick, and not so frequent - so they don't bother me."
"playlist creation and downloaded songs removal could use some work, all I want is a ""select multiple"" button. but overall wonderful app, the best actually."
"Haven't had a lot of hiccups, which is nice while in China (a lot of apps require VPN). Works well on data; pauses and plays itself whenever media turns on in another app."
Better than other music players. love the feature where you build a playlist and it has recommendations for songs to add to that particular playlist.
Great BUT... I hate the fact that the free user UI on Android looks way better than those who pay for premium like myself. I would suggest the same or a better interface for us premium users.
"The best app for music streaming, although sometimes I missed keeping offline music on my phone (but well...). Spotify never crashed and the premium subscription is totally affordble. I love the playlist feature as well. Just put everything there and I can choose a playlist which suits my moods on different days. Go spotify!"
User friendly. I enjoy but wish the premium account would allow you to use on multiple devices. At home I use my tablet at work I would like to be able to use my phone. I made an inquiry more than 7 days ago and have yet to get a response from Spotify.
"Amazing overall app. Ads are very annouing, but it's a simple and nice app that allows you to listen to good music. It obviously doesnt work offline unless you have premium, but that's fine with me! Although i personally dont like that it takes up about 500-600 MB for me, personally"
"Every song you would ever want to listen to. Make playlist, find other's playlist, browse similar artist, download playlist so you don't have to use data. Wouldn't ever change to another music streaming app... unless they raised their prices quite a bit."
Everything here is amazing. A UI change would be great. Please add the animation on the lock screen plus make it landscape again. Thank you!
One of the best UI's ever used for music apps. Would be wonderful if licence issues get resolved quickly and we can stream all the artists like Clean Bandit and Muse.
The application is very intuitive and is good. The only issue I am facing is that the hidden songs on a playlist are still being played for some reason.
"Great app, love the play lists built so many, well with the subscription for family, my wife and I haven't bought a CD in ages, don't ever really struggle to find a track, have had some glitches now and again but tend to be resolved in following update"
"easy to use, great quality sound, and super intuitive! all of the personalized stations are great! I don't know how their algorithms work, but they are dead on when it comes to finding suggestions for new music and playing artist's radio."
"Update: thank you for listening to our suggestions, works awesome again. Keep it up! Please do something asap with the resolution of the app's design. For 6.3 inch phones (1080x2340 px) the icon looks awful when opening up and the home screen enlarged and disproportionate. Edit: latest update seems to solve this, great!"
dont understand why I can no longer remove an artist from my artist list????? a little irritating but other then that pretty good app. love that I can listen to shuffle or a single album but the normal volume us kinda quiet with my phone turned all the way up. but great app!
"Genuinely my most favourite app on the phone. If I had the entire day to not do anything, I would probably just spotify the whole day. The recommendation engine is just out of this world as is the playlist curation. Easily the best app to listen to music on. Hope the Indian version gets access to all the music in the world soon and not just the limited access that it has right now."
excelent service quick response and seemless followons. also a vast and varied selection. Spotify collections and mood themes are outstanding.
"Awesome music apps!! Complete collections of all, best quality, very much user friendly, suitable for all of your emo & feelings. One of must have apps in your devices!!!"
"I tried and liked Spotify. Spotify is ahead of Google Play Music & Apple Music in terms of Playlists and sound customizing options. Very good selection of playlists and at night one can use diff sound modes, normalize, quiet, loud which you cannot find in other apps. Collection is also good. Almost all the collection you can find here as well. Stability of app is much better than Apple Music"
"This app is amazingly build! I'm still a free user, but they provide a playlist which I could freely choose without getting shuffled to another song. The playlist even have a cpllection of wondrous songs!"
"Easy to use, UI is easy on the eyes, easily finding new music to enjoy and staying on top of the latest releases from your fa ourite artists. Dead set was meant to only use the 3 month free trial and go back to YouTube/downloading free music but even up using for almost whole 2 years and counting and paying for the premium! highly suggest you give it a go because yes, Spotify doesn't have some of specific tracks from specific artists but like... high quality playback......"
"Well worth the money! The app features are a bit difficult to use. Seniors, particularly have a hard time using the app; a basic feature button would benefit those who are not computer savvy. How do I reorder the songs in a playlist? otherwise app deserves 5 stars."
"hey there i personally have not used your service but my family 5 members us use it often. love your app and have enjoyed it very much vis a vi my family. nice very nice. it is wonderful to know that i can listen to music at anytime. quite nice really. i will get there eventually. my listening music is Christian and classic. But 2 of my favorite songs from the 60's are by the ""Rascals""govin"" and it's a ""Beautiful Morning"" please post this. love to chat. fun fun fun"
"excellent generally. just a few slightly annoying niggles, such as constant little updates on layout and not as intuitive to delete queued songs."
Life changing for someone stuck in his collection of 80's cds and who hates listening to radio. Love it. It would be awesome if there were skip controls on the shuffle play page and option to create playlist from queue page. Also it would be grest to be able to skip songs with double click of volume button on phone. Then it would be 10 stars.
"Great application for finding songs, playlist and keeping a collection of music to get you through tough times. God has blessed me through quick access to music."
"Been using this service for years as a premium member. Recently upgraded my plan to include Hulu amd couldn't be happier about that. The interface can be a bit cluttered on mobile platforms (hence the non 5 star review) but this doesnt ruin the experience at all, in my honest opinion."
"Fantastic App with all the music you could ever wish for. Would be great to have a select button to be able to move more then one song to a different or new playlist at once, could also be used to share more then one song at once."
"The best music app ever! Simple UI, better song recommendations, and infinite playlists, songs based on genre, mood, country, region... Everything is blended well into spotify. Thanks."
I have had Spotify for quite a while and I would recommend the product from a consumer standpoint but not from an artist standpoint. I do admire the service and I do frequently use it.
"While the user interface has a rather steep learning curve and some of the buttons are quite touchy, once you are comfortable with it, the myriad and range of different things you can do, is unmatched as far as streaming apps go IMO."
"Canvas Idea, please add an option or a button to disable the canvas for the current song. Like somewhere in the current song interface/screen that we don't have to go to the settings and disable canvas affecting all songs. I want some canvas for some songs but not all of them."
"love it!! the free version obviously has ads but I don't think it's too bad and you can watch a quick video to get 30 min of ad free music. i make my own playlist and they pretty much have everything i search for, for the most part."
"for some reason, it stopped working on the lock screen (Samsung s9). I have to drag down the notifications menu to manipulate the buttons in THAT menu rather than the lock screen menu. idk why, I'm reinstalling to see if it'll fix it."
I will say I was skeptical about spotify Free account versus premium account but I've been a member of spotify for a while now and I have must got to say I'm quite happy not being able to fast forward more than a certain amount of times and being able to start your playlist off with their specific track and now that who is involved with spotify premium $10 a month is certainly well worth it
"Once you go premium, this is the best music app in the Playstore in my oppinion. Vast selection of music plus a free Hulu account. Without premium it's hard to listen to what you want sometimes, but the adds aren't quite that annoying. Most adds come from spotify themselves."
"the only things i would change are 1) quit adding to the playlists being created by me... most are songs i dont even want cuz yall dont know me. 2) i was under the impression that this apo wiukd continue to play while working on other apps, which has hold mostly true...it stops when the camera is open, and during the use of most of the social media apps on my phone. Overall, better than pandora and youtube for sure."
an amazing app that lets you play music for free i've tried cople free music app and u mostly got a limited amount of musics and short period of time to hear a certain music. thanks spotify. with the app you've built i became adicted to hearing music everytime i'm easting my time on my phone üòä
"please try to include a simple WiFi only feature alongside the offline mode. i'll have to restrict background data until this is addressed. we shouldn't have to take such aggressive options to safeguard data usage. the offline feature is too over-encompassing. most users require the app to feed off hotspots, not their data plans."
"its an amazing app, you can listen to all kinds off music for free, create your own playlist and organize it however you want, you also get a mix that suits your taste in music called discovered weekly which refreshes every monday."
Stamps Apple music into the dirt. Can be played across all formats and all my favourite albums are available to download.....unlike Apple music which I found quite limited.
good on the Premium. a suggested Discoverly Weekly list that i get 15 likable tunes out of 30 or so ..once.. you get a library built of liked/custom play lists . that's worth more than 4 CDs a month (that may only contain 2-3 good songs)
"Easy to navigate app. Literally every song you can think of on here. Premium is 100% worth going for, especially with the student discount deal. Go smash that download button."
"I love how I can find almost every songs that I want to listen. Also, loving the premium features especially listening offline. It saves my internet data, just download it once and then you can listen to it offline. The only downside is that the price for premium is quite pricey. Anyways, overall I am satisfied."
"Simple, beautiful and a clean design which is easy to use. The recommended playlists are top notch, I've founs plenty of new songs and artists to listen to thanks to Spotify."
adds can get exhausting but they are only once every half hour and cheap to buy off if you but the app. Other then that it's a great app for music and has an excellent shuffle button for mixing up music
Love spotify. But it does get very annoying when it buffers. I'll press the pause button and the music is still playing in the background. I'll close spotify but the music is still playing! Gets old after a while.
"The mobile app is way worse than the desktop one, please make them the same, or bring them both to an equilibrium. Maybe rebalance the free version. Instead of shuffle only and not being able to play a specific song, add more ads. You get it. Otherwise epic app."
good music. easy search for songs/artists. i hope they bring in an optional feature like including the lyrics per song as they play (with an on/off button).
"Best music app! every music i want to listen is available on Spotify! simple UI, small app size, and easy to use. great job! :)"
"The app is great. The UI and the curated playlists are just amazing. The look and feel of the app is also pretty cool. Although, you might want to add a shuffle button and a repeat button in the player window in the android app :D"
"large selection of music and pre-built playlists. Premium and hulu for $10 a month, this is the best music player I've used."
"Cant live without it - Premium monthly service is so worth it. better then anything even close. Just wish it had built in lyrics!! Come on Spotify, we know you can do it!!"
App is all good and works well with my TV when its connected via WIFI. Been subscribed for quite a long time and will continue to do so as I'm searching for new songs to hear everyday
"This is the best music streaming app ,and you can take my word for it , if you don't wanna take of others. The apl knows your preferences and makes playlists best suited. It also streams new songs automatically, so your hassle of searching new songs is gone. And no, i am not being paid by Spotify."
everything is good but it doesn't give lyrics to the music (as in 'ganna' app) . lyrics help us to make or sing properly. wish u could build that feature.
very good app . . better sound quality . . .and some songs are still not available in our region . please make them available soon! its been quite some time since the app was released in my country üòëüòï
"If you love classic rock and roll... Then just download it... it never gonna upset you from it's collection... But after launching in India, it seems some popular songs are not available... i hope the authority could have the concern to build it more flexible..."
love it! love that I can control my Computer speakers with my Smart watch! don't love the UI. kinda hard to just see all the songs an artist has posted without having to go through all the albums.
"i have the new update for the Galaxy S8. When my screen in locked, the pause, skip, and rewind buttons do not work. please fix"
Variety of options. Having an eclectic range of musical interests makes that a massive bonus. I personally like the build your own playlist feature.
Beautiful UI and amazing UX. Nicely curated selection of songs and playlist as per the taste of the user. Only issue is that the subscription price is higher than its competitors in India.
"Excellent. Spotify opens up the World of music. High quality device/sound controls .. accurate and appropriate suggestions very much related to the music you are listening to, easy to use intuitive application ... need I go on with an endless list of advantages over other platforms? Try it for yourself and see. üòä"
"Amazing app, awesome integration with other devices, quite open song selection, premium plans have fair prices and the app's interface overall is just intuitive and amazing to use, yet simple and somewhat elegant."
"it's been a good experience till now. It just got released in India and I'm happy it did. It has good features even in the freemium version. There's actually no requirement of the premium. The only thing is some songs aren't available to play in my country. Any help with this. Except that, this is my permanent music streamer now."
Spotify is an excellent service. The playlists and AI curated playlists are vry well made and seem to always to get the right mood. the quality of the tracks are superb for digital copies. The UI is complete garbage however and seems to get progressively less intuitive. This is easily fixed and would make the experience a 5/5 one at that.
"The best app for streaming music in my opinion. Great UI, great recommendations and results, just an all-around great app. I will never use anything else."
"Great UI, all the music you could ever want, and they reccomend music that you might like through the Discover Weekly playlist. By the way, this is not a paid review, I just love this app. If you don't have it, get it. Hulu is also included with Spotify Premium, which is great and adds even more value to the $10 monthly subscription."
"Best UI, great selection of everything you could think of or want, so intuitive, and quick. Couldn't make it through a day without spotify."
"Good app. Some original versions of songs are not available though, mostly revival. And sometimes, search button takes a long time to load"
"Love Spotify! I give it five stars because there isn't really anything I can complain about. I do wish the app had a built in equalizer, like a ten band. Also would love to see some hd options like Tidal. Tidals customer service is enough for me to never leave Spotify. please make this happen folks."
"Absolutely love this app, I created a14 hour wedding playlist on this!!!!, all sorts of songs and genre's of music to suit everyone. I love the freedom it gives you to listen to every different type of music you like then it gives you suggestions to other playlist you could be interested in. Once you have made your play lists they're there for as long as you want them and you have around a billion songs and artists to choose from. The absolute best app out there bar none!"
Awesome app and with premium only $9.99 you get Hulu included unlimited skips and no adds ! build your own playlists and listen offline anywhere. highly recommend for xbox users or any music enthusiast.
"I like that my music selections don't just ""disappear"" after I have built my playlists and that virtually any song I want I can download. Thank you Spotify!"
just got Spotify yesterday and it worked great so I got premium and now app won't even open................ As a previous business owner I know there are alway glitches and catch that screw things up. What show a GOOD business is how you answer and fix these issues. Spotify responded very quickly and had a fix for my problem immediately. To me that shows a good business.
"This is a truly awesome app. Fantastic selection of music, and intuitive programming that learns and remembers your specific music preferences, searches, preferred artists, etc. to build a number of daily playlists and recommendations specific to you and your style of music. Highly recommended app"
This app is amazing. I can't describe it. But i have 2 suggestion if you can make sure to add it public will really appreciate it. 1. Pls add lyrics option. Because many of the people like to read lyrics while song is playing. 2. Pls add a option to suffle songs. I suggest that you should also add a shuffle button to all playlists.
Best app and personally my first choice for songs but the non premium users might face frustrating things such as limited number of skips or not being able to play full songs but only a few seconds and ton of ads on UI and between songs.
Not able to find a lot of English songs. Hoping that it would be fixed in the upcoming updates. Good recommendations for Telugu and Hindi songs. But need to increase the library of songs. Price for premium is a bit high. Understand that it is required to break even but would expect the prices for the premium facility to be reduced in the forseeable future
"Solid app but everytime I update, its a chance. The UI gets changed almost everytime and it gets annoying since I have grown accustomed to an older versions UI. You guys either gotta have an option to revert to an old UI or just pick one and stick with it."
"The UI is easy to use, the student discount is amazing, and the song database is huge. I would recommend Spotify to anyone."
"Exceptional, but needs search function update. Ive been putting off getting spotify premium for a long time. Being a YT Music user, i enjoy the quickness and accessibility of YT. But with Spotify i get more personalized stations, and also Ps4 access.. Only problem is how lanky it feels to search a song or artist. The search funtion just needs an update to make it more user friendly. Will most likely be canceling other subs for this still."
"Very good app, unfortunate that you can only choose what song you listen to in the desktop app and premuim. 4 stars because sometimes on the mobile app it adds other music to my playlist."
"as far as music streaming services go, this is my personal favorite. the UI is clean and easy to navigate and never have I wanted to hear a song and searched only to find it not there."
spotify is a great way to listen to and catalogue music you already know and love. I rarely run into issues with the app and any kinks are usually worked out very quickly.
Great but...of bcs i rate it 4 stars...when I press the top left button looking like this (V) when I press it...it shows an advertisement and I pressed dismiss it goes back to the song I am playing that's why I hated it *hmph*...(I hope Spotify sees this)
"Just getting started, but the tailored playlists are cool. Listening to some recent work by artists I haven't heard in quite a while, and offshoots of groups I was at one time very interested in. Then I see that my second playlist is much more the sorts of things I'm currently most involved in, so thematically very diverse and intriguing...curious what future lists might be comprised of."
Having access to my favorite music at the push of button has significantly improved the quality of my life. I never realized how much I was missing my favorite music until now. Thank you Spotify
"I'd go for 5 stars except for: car mode in landscape is really random... the timeline bar should be further from the like/dislike buttons because 9 out of 10 times it's a miss. Can't find an easy way to go back into car mode if I exit it for any reasons. Can't ""unblock"" accidentally blocked songs in the playlists. And finally, Private Session should be more easily accessible."
"7 years strong! Been using this app for 7 years(premium), and haven't once had one issue. The library is massive and the UI is friendly(the new one looks very sleek) keep on keeping on Spotify, You have my vote!"
"App is great and 5 star for that but I would like more features. Things I would like to see in the app. - Repeat track option. - Sound Equilizer. - Swiping down at the ""Now Playing Song"" should take you back to where you were, navigation wise."
"Finally spotify is officially available in India. Everything else is great, but why aren't we getting the songs by Ed, Panic!, Paramore, Bruno, Twenty one pilots, etc. The list is very big! We are paying for a better music experience and it's quite well but still it feels incomplete. The new interface is good. Waiting for so long and we want to enjoy more music from our fav artists."
The new UI update is a big improvement! Really like that we can now turn off the musics videos autoplaying as i really prefer seeing the album art.
"When it comes to music, all what you need is a good set of hardware, and Spotify. Nothing else. Spotify never cease to amaze me how well built and how much rich it's"
"the only problem i have is related to spotify premium offer! I did all that was required of me to get one free month or 30 days premium promo. from spotify, but never got that offer to materialise for me yet may-be i did not clearly understand what was requested of me in order to qualify? Can someone tell me what i did wrong...?"
"Great experience yet the new update has a few hitches. For example, I wish the new player UI could work landscape like the former design, and when swiping album covers to skip, sometimes it displays ""you need premium to peek at the next song"" despite me already having premium."
"This app has been excellent until a few days ago when 5 of my daily mixes became cross contaminated with each other and the 6th one was filled with tons of bands not like anything else I listen to. I was going to go in to dislike all of the bands on the mix but the dislike button is gone and only the heart button remains. the dislike button is still present in the release radar and discover weekly, but not daily mixes. whatever happened in the last update is what caused this."
"Great app, lots of music to choose from, introduced me to a lot of new songs I now daily listen to. One problem. The widget. You seem to have completely ignored it, it's always 4x1 size, and cannot be customized whatsoever. Think about the widget people, we love to customize our layouts of the screen, and this is just a nuisance at the moment. At least it works... Please consider making it customizable. Please"
This is the king of online music apps. Music lovers must have this app. It satisfies all music tastes plus its own playlists are awesome. I love its UI/UX which is very fluid and smooth.
Premium member. Can't change songs/pause from the lock screen anymore or via my car uconnect system. Used to be a great app but this lack of functionality is really ruining my experience as I primarily use spotify while driving. Incredibly disappointed.
the best music streaming app I've used. the UI could do with some tweaking because not everything is intuitive. 5 stars none the less. thanks Spotify!
this last update (as of 4/3/2019) is all I could have asked for. 4 stars because i personally hate the car mode and wish i could turn it off in the settings vs having to hit two buttons every time I get into a car.
"Could be the perfect music app, if not for a terrible UI on Android. Who needs the stupid hide button in plain sight, and where are the repeat buttons?"
"The most all inclusive music app that carries most versions/renditions of the music and more one would need. Build a library, listen offline and the quality is almost near the sound dynamics of Amazon."
"really not fond of the new UI, the menu thing for a song (if you wanna see the artists details) is way too far up the screen. also, the heart is a little goofy as compared to the plus (you knew what the plus did intuitively, and didnt need goofy messages to tell you). Also that cheeky message that appears when you remove a song from the library appears everytime. gets old fast"
"I love this app. It's a great tool for finding music, building playlists and finding music that's similar to what you listen to but may not have heard. I would give you 5 stars, but I do have one issue. PLEASE pay artists more for their royalties and plays. They work hard and dedicate their lives to making music for people to listen to. Unless they a mainstream band, they are NOT making very good money."
"I'd like to see a much better interface an UX for podcasts. the potential is great, but at the moment i have a two key bug bears: 1. can we have the option to mark an entire podcast as played, rather than just individual buttons, sometimes i snooze a podcast and take a break, but the blue icon is difficult to then remove and be able to understand where i actually have new episodes 2. the ability to rate and review podcasts!! i want to see if a podcast is good, not presume just by its tile image"
"Everything about this is great. Very convenient. however, I'm in the beta program and the canvas option automatically switches off. please fix that. otherwise all songs sound amazing, UI is slick and most of all the song recommendations are amazing."
"Fantastic app, great UI and UX, pretty much any music you can think of, but need to pay artists more for their music. ‚Ç¨0.0006 per stream is ridiculous."
The best music streaming apps out there! I love how they curate playlists specially suited to your music taste based on the types of songs you listen to it. Great sound quality too. Definitely recommend it! Plus you get a month's free membership for the premium version!
"Wish they kept more ""detailed"" info on what they do when they update and ""improve various aspects of the app"" i had trouble with this app for about a month. Since my Galaxy S9+ updated UI android 9.0 (or also called Android UI One for some reason) my bluetooth became unresponsive i really didn't want to Uninstall and Reinstall so i tried everything possible troubleshooting besides that but low and behold ONLY the Uninstall and Reinstall worked. THANKFULLY it worked just wish i new thata month B4"
"god tier, best music app. not perfect but better than all others. i use this exclusively both on mobile and on pc. worst things abt this app is the limited social features and mediocre UI."
"i deleted the app originally on my phone because it took up so much data and space and i thought i could just get on my ipad instead and it would be ok but it turns out that spotify costs on apple so i got youtube music thinking that it would work just like spotify, if you go off the app it will still play but no thats a ""premium luxury"" on youtube music and so i got spotify again and im so glad it exists 5 stars!"
Great app.usar friendly and convenient.and the best thing is awesome streaming quality....just 1 request that don't ruin the app by advertise of something in between songs. This is best music app I have ever seen...
"It's amazing easy with a simple design lesser ads, but the size is too big and exhaust's a lot of data and i think adding some playlists of new songs up a lil more to the front would be nice."
The application is really smooth and having access to all officially released content of the musicians I like is great. Spotify has a very intresting algorhythm for music suggestions; features like the Radio of a song/album and the Daily/Weekly Playlists are great and helped me find out some new artists. But however I like it's features and design there is a clear bias in what music genres are represented and promoted. Therefore it cannot be used as an exclusive personal music library for me.
I've tried other similar apps but there's none better than spotify for me. It works because it's intuitive and it's intuitive because it works.
Awesome Music Experience with Sony Phone . Good set of Playlists. Auto Daily Mix. Attractive UI. Great thing is Sony Music Equalizer promptly giving variant sound for music lover. Loved Spotify.
"you know you're good. I love the application, but just if the UI(including the theme or not your choice) could be a lil bit better then the 19-20 would become 21. but no compromise with the sound performance; it is what i really love about your appüôÇ"
Everything is perfect except when I click on a song it opens the interface and whole UI shifts up for a sec for lyrics which is so damn irritating so hope you fix this.
"Only complaint is the repeat button is gone... please bring it back. I sleep to spotify playlists, and when they are over now, without that button, it stops and wakes me up."
"Best thing ever!!! But I would like more songs to be added in my region(India). A lot missing like that from Led Zappelin, David Gilmour,etc. And with that, it's quite slow even with a good network. Overall, it's awsome!"
"it really is amazing how much they can offer for such a cheap price there are some bugs now and then, like missing album art, spotify continuingly playing after closing the app or new released songs not being listed in the ""new releases"" even though they are already on Spotify But when they manage to fix those bugs, the app is flawless and recommended for everyone enjoying music"
phenomenal music application. Every verified artist is easily accessible. Hope they keep making updates and continue to find ways to make spotify even more intuitive.
"App works ok. It's great that track repeat button is back in album view üëçüëçüëç It would be great if it was possible to use downloaded music as alarm sound (without being connected to the internet, premium members of course). But I really don't know if this is spotify or android clock app issue."
"Simoly put, thr Spotify experience is one that is uncomplaining. It just works. it's got a much wider range ofusic compared to Apple music, and offers a much better and more efficient UI. The subscription is certainly worth it, and take into consideration the family bundle!"
"Incredible accuracy fun and easy to use. Note that ever since Apple bought Shazam and removed the link from shazam to Spotify, it requires an extra step to add a song to your Spotify list. Im so mad at Apple for forcing users to use only its music service, that im willing to take the extra step. Voice your right for having choices as a consummer: use Spotify!"
"I've loved spotify for years now, it's my go-to app for music. Unfortunately it glitches quite a bit and in one of the updates they got rid of the search function in a playlist, now you always have to go to the settings of the playlist and then press 'find in playlist'.. It's a waste of time imo"
as an user i feel like listening with spotify for limited amount of time is good as after that all beats feels same. like other streaming apps it too has the drawback of becoming battery draining & feel somewhat its like data eating too. anyways still it can be done as good as for ios with time. multiple times it reezes and app closes automatically. but i love the app as i heard of the app quite a long in all youtube reviews. lets feel it little longer then only experience can be summarised.
"Lots of songs are missing like Linkin park, SYML and many other artist so this is my request to you guys please put all the songs from various artist. And rest of the things are very very good and interface of app is so beautifully designed, color of the background is so good.. Great job guys love from india."
"Spotify is a great app, but the only problem I have with it is that songs will play automatically, even when I haven't been on the app or touched any buttons or anything. And this mainly happens when I wake up in the morning. If there is any solution to fixing this, please let me know. But other than that, like I said, Spotify is an awesome app."
"Its just a solid app with a great user experience. I had no intention of keeping premium after my trial ended, but given the effort and extensive library I am going to have a hard time giving it up!"
It suits me for almidt everything I loom for in music. I just wish i could have more access to underground tunes. But you can't really want more than that . it works wonders.
"I'm not a fan of the new UI. It really feels a little unnecessarily dumbed down. Otherwise, I absolutely love the service Spotify provides over other streaming services."
"Amazing platform, absolutely no problems that stand out when one thinks, quite possibly one of the best music streaming apps out there."
amazing music application. Its having an Amazing UI. Music is avialable from a wide variety of collection. Playlists are so useful.
best music streaming service! the social aspect of it could use some work- I'm thinking messaging app within it. extensive library and intuitive radio/song selection algorithms are a big plus!
"works ok with Note 9 it has glitches and sometimes the songs can be skipped having the premium of course been waiting for a fix quite some time, the only fix is restarting the app sometimes."
"more like a 4.5 but would be on the minimum end of 4, has latest release except for some music like mixtapes like datpiff but has the more radio music hot mixes plus ultra extra. lets you save downlod to offline,. . . but only a limited amount so cuts down on playlist made and such. but with awesome internet and aweaome gb bout 1 gb you can play online recommend playlist that suits your music need or learn a new language, or maybe get into a serious talk on podcast. anyways ps4 has it. golden!"
"Makes one Fall in Love with Music again. Uninterrupted Music, Quality Sound, Beats all the Music Apps out there. UI/UX design original and very smooth to manoveur. Highly Recommend üëå. Would want to see some fitness app integration!"
The entire music of our world is available instandly with just a push of a button. Amazing. Easy to handle and fun to use.
"well, spotify is a wonderful library of music and music is a lifetime of memories. just press a button and those good times come storming back. without music life would be awfully empty.so tune in and spotify will not disappoint you. guaranteed. p.s. ( send my residuals to ... just kidding )"
"Got all the music I ever wanted. Intuitive and beautiful design, look amazing on iPad, iPhone, Android and my apple watch. I can control music simultaneously on multiple devices!"
Current version 8.4.97.807 is probably the best one yet. Minor improvements to the UI and most importantly... the repeat button is back!
"Fantastic extras chosen by Spotify really hit the button, some of the artists I didnt even know and now they are an essential part of my playlist. Absolutely Fantastic."
This is the best music app undoubtedly. Suggestions it gives are amazing. UI is good. catalogue is very wide so ot never disappoints you.
love spotify! I wont use any other apps. spotify builds multiple daily mix playlists based on my listening habits and omg it is ALWAYS spot on. Iove that i can search songs and download songs for offline listening. best music app out there.
There is a bug on the app making the music stop on its own after the latest update. the music stops and you need to reopen the screen for it to play. as well my lock screen spotify buttons do not work. please check this
Basically it is ok but there are 2 things thst i miss comparing to ios: 1. Searching song in playlist. We should be able to search it way easier as there is in ios (by scrolling up search bar is shown). In android version you have to tap that three dots and then go to find in playlist- too complicated! 2. When i want to remote music from my headphones i can only pause and play. Headphone button can not play next song by pressing button twice as it was on ios. Add this 2 features will be 5/5
this is a great app i became a member but since the first day of march theres been a problem where the music stop even tho its showing the option to stop the song plz fix this problem as soon as possible because its ruining the app and I know I'm not the only one experiencing this cuz I've seen alot of forums about this on Google plz fix!!
"The free version is a nuisance with all the ads. Premium is fairly affordable for what you get (offline mode, higher quality streaming, NO ADS, etc). The catalogue is also slightly limited in India - I noticed certain tracks grayed out when I switched locales from US to India. The free version could definitely do without annoying ads every few songs. It previously used to play them for a couple minutes every hour, why can't it just revert to that?"
Great app for music. Clean UI. Great UX. Especially the Genius Behind the Lyrics integration makes music a lot more interesting. üëå
"App could still be more responsive, and a lot more intuitive. However they have recently ironed out some really annoying bugs, for example I can now see my albums again! phew! Also the built-in wireless speaker / play through device support is beyond handy if you have a sonos system. I just wish when they absorbed groove they also kept the option to use the groove interface, as that app was visually 100x better."
"i love spotify, but lately its been acting up i cant exit the app without the music continuing and its irritating. also the music either cuts off or doesnt play at all, im really just trying to enjoy my music but its not working right."
Spotify is the BEST app to listen to music on. All the songs that I like are there and can be played with the tap of a button!
I love having the ability to make playlists of my favourites past + present. There's a wide choice - even some quite obscure things.
"Excellent! Waiting for it to arrive in India! This is the best music streaming app out there! Most important to me is the availability accross all platforms: Android, iOS, Linux and Windows. Its functionality is consistent accross these platforms, too! The pricing in India is bang-on-target! I highly recommend it to anyone!"
"Ok, this stuff is one of the best out there. The presentation, user experience, casting options are simply phenomenal. I want the lyrics feature to be added the earliest."
"Only three stars not that i don't like the app, I love the tech and design. The four star rating is only because of the availability of music. Most of the Indian artists and some of the international labels are unable, which puts me off. Hope this scene changes, if it does will re-edit the review and give a Huge Thumps Up!"
"ads irritate a lot and user can't able to enjoy listening songs and it need to also add more songs which are quit popular. It just need to remove excessive ads, which seems important in this version, for making happy users."
"I like how there are curated playlists on the app for me, also I like the seamless and easy design of the app. There is a great range of music available from jazz, to meditation relaxing sounds, popular music and so forth, so far so good!"
"I can see why it is used the most out of all the music streaming apps over the world. The UI is simple, the streaming quality is good, so is the library. Only thing about Premium which breaks the deal is the pricing. In my region, there are really good steaming services with a good interface and catalogue as well. A little competitive pricing and partnership with some network service providers for discounted subscription would be great."
Love the app. Especially their playlists and music recommendations. Even the unpaid version's audio quality is quite decent. Way better than prime music or Saavn.
Spotify is great overall but the new UI for the 'Now Playing' tab is rather ugly in my opinion. Now the text and symbols all have their size and even colour changed and it isn't too flattering. (for that I give 4 stars instead of 5)The previous design was slicker and fancier.
"A great app to listen to more music than you ever thought possible (including downloads for offline listening). The artist radio stations remind you of music you haven't heard in ages, or forgot about. Bonus points for a Linux desktop app too. If you're looking to add new features (developers), it would be handy to like/ favourite songs without having to unlock my phone. Too many layers of security and swiping (on modern phones) just to tick or heart a song."
I have found songs i havn't heard in ages. Also the generes i have selected provide great results. it is quite easy to use. Absolutely happy with the app and service as well.
"Best playlists, lots of content including songs, podcasts and much more with smooth and versatile UI as well as cross platform connectivity. You can just plug out earphones from your phone and plug into your PC and continue the same song from the same lyrics at any time."
I've been an avid user of Pandora for years but finally decided to actually try Spotify recently. I can comfortably say that I will be cancelling my subscription to Pandora. Spotify's service is robust and straightforward. The only thing I can hope for is stronger learning algorithms like Pandora's for music station building based on my tastes.
It's pretty good. Most tracks I've looked for I've found. Only really had trouble finding quite obscure music. Not perfect but pretty good.
"I've used the UK version of Spotify and it's the best music streaming experience out there no doubt. This Indian version has great potential... but there's loads of International songs missing, no family plan etc and that's a bummer. Hopefully Spotify gets their issues sorted out quickly so we can relish the full experience üî•üôèüèº."
"Losing that one star only because of songs that are not available in the Indian version. Amazing UI, amazing song recommendations. Everything is pretty dope. Loving it!"
Lost the heart symbol after upgrading to premium so can't like songs quockly to keep track of it. Is a pain in the ass to add to playlist. An easier playlist button which remembers the playlist you last added to like youtube would make everything so much easier. Anyway they have game ost's so that's awesome.
Best music app ever I've came across. Playlist sharing and UI is awesome. It has lots of features in pro version.
Still needs some polishing.. Like swiping animations and smooth ui.. But overall best music streaming app. This is the best.. Add some more features for music playing like adjusting your queue.
this is the kind of music library i was looking for. spotify surely learns the taste of our music and creates best suited playlist . I enjoyed the app to every minute. worth buying the subscription as well
"An amazing app for streaming and downloading music. I haven't experienced such personalised playlists and song recommendations in any other app so far. Plus, the user experience is top notch and different and I'm a big fan of the dark theme."
My only complaint is that Spotify India couldn't acquire all the licenses before their launch. A few artists and albums are missing. The experience is still great and this will turn into a 5 star rating after I can stream ALL the music I like.
"The service is really good. Seamless integration on separate devices. However, would like to have more Indian playback singers on the list. Its quite limited as of now."
Great collection. One of the best music service I've used. Very clean and non intrusive UI. Only one gripe: even their Very High streaming quality is less than Gaana's HD quality. It is even more noticeable when using earphones.
"Take the trial then decide, but do take the premkum trial. I've been a spotify fanboy for years so might be a bit biased but the UI on this app has been far better than any other at the moment. That said, the music collection is still slightly limited. Hopefully it gets fixed soon."
"i been using this long time, and this is the best among others.. i like the layout design and the way they present the playlist and recommendations...easy to use .Only frustating to me was some of my favorite artist was no avail..especially the albums of tadao hayashi's FINGERTRIP. and older album of john kaizan neptune was no avail...please have it available..thank you"
"Spotify is Spotify - nearly every song I want to listen to available, easy to handle, etc. The fairly frequent layout/design changes can get a bit annoying though. And sometimes, out of the blue, the app has strange quirks (like stopping to play music with locked screen). Other than that - all good!"
"I got tuned in to Spotify by my daughter, and although I like a lot about it, I'm miss how Pandora makes suggestions of music based on my interests. I have to admit that building my own playlist is what brought me into the Spotify world."
it's soo good. I have no problems listening to music. I can hear high guality sound tracks and music! latest and new of all artists that I love. very fluid and responsive.It has clean and minimalistic interfere which look stunning. I love spotify and was waiting for it...
"The service is great, but app is far from perfect. It often requires me to restart an app in order to control my playback from my mac. As said above: I would rate the service by 5, but not the app."
Everything is amazing thanks for the most waited launch in India UI is awesome please dont mess the UI with popuping regions unless the consumer follows like mostly every other apps screw this up im impressed with this UI i wanna do 5 start but for now 3 its not kinda disappoinment but little disappoinment . üòï Background play and lock sceen play should be there its a hightlight to the app .Anyway i love it ‚ù§
I love this! I run heavy equipment and it's nice to play whatever comes to mind or anytime. I'm so tired of the fm radio music all it does is play new songs repeatedly till its an over kill. Thumbs Up!
"This app is great! Unfortunately, after the latest update the pause button doesn't work every time. I'll have to poke it a couple of times before it'll pause, which is annoying when your toddler starts taking to you before you get it paused."
"Can't Imagine my day without Spotify! Clearly, it's the best application for music. It knows your taste, your likes, your dislikes. Plus you have these great playlists which can you listen to according to your mood and genre and the UI is amazing and so smooth! Thank you so much for getting this in INDIA. Have been waiting for it since long!"
"Mostly everything one could wish for. Even a native desktop app for Linux. However, I would appreciate more customising options for organising the library, particularly tagging, collections and lists, possibility of adding playlists and podcasts to meta-playlists, and bookmarks or shortcuts in the library menu. In addition, the podcast section could be better arranged, not only into general categories."
"in india, the only issue is that the app doesn't have a repeat button for which a particular song can't be played in a loop. it's kind of shuffle play. and thats annoying. the only bug"
love spotify but I'm getting ticked off at the fact that I skip and the same song plays still so I press the skip button again and it skips twice I do not pay but please fix this it's been going on for a week and is very annoying. and yes I do wait and it's not lag
The best music player. However I could suggest Spotify learn from Joox in term of song rankings and karaoke type lyrics. Quite hate it when you click top 50 songs in Malaysia but only International songs instead of mix with some local songs.
"Spotify is really dope! No doubt about it. I am still experimenting with other streaming services and trying to get a feel for what suits me and Spotify is right up there with the best of them. Just can't figure out how to que my podcasts in the order that suits my different tastes. Don't call me stupid just yet... I'm sure if there is a way then I will find it, given enough time."
"the app is awesome, and love it all though for a premium user, im not happy that a downloaded playlist will not continue to play when offline, although it recognizes the last played song when paused, but it never plays how many ever times i press the play button, im pretty sure this is a very minute issue and can definitely be fixed easily, just felt thr need to inform you all and help improve the app"
"I been using spotify for a long time. Nearly for 4 years back when it didn't even launch in India. Illegally downloaded it and used along with a VPN. No doubt this is the best music streaming app amongst the ones available in today's market but it lacks a real big thing. A repeat button and a shuffle button. Please add that. Its not a big deal for your development team. You add those, I buy the premium. üòä"
"I love Spotify all around. It's a great service and app, which always works and has an intuitive design."
"Thank you for finally coming to India üáÆüá≥‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. Have wanted spotify for such a long time, i genuinely hate all the other music streaming platforms. Having used Apple music, amazon music and saavn i cant wait to use spotify. Have heard so much about the app from friends who have access to the app. Just hope that the subscription price is not too much otherwise spotify wouldn't be able to penetrate this market."
"I love the Daily Mix, though I could do without the bad German stuff. I can make playlists to suit my mood and whatever it is I'm doing, cooking, relaxing or gaming. Awesome app, well worth it to get Premium. Only I can't because I don't own a credit card and never will."
"Your newest update isn't really working very well with me. The problem I'm having is that i just want to play ONE SONG but it now requires me to play and ENTIRE PLAYLIST to get to the song. If you were to downgrade it BACK to before this update, that would be great. -Ray"
"It's nice but sometime I don't enjoy it when I press the ""like"" button for the songs b/c it will play the same songs and will not generate different songs that are similar to the ones I ""liked""."
"Great app, great features, fairly intuitive. Missing some artists I'd like to have included, and higher sound quality would be nice. Overall well worth the money."
"worth it, a complete music app functions as it is built for.A way better than other dirt. Annoyed of not preferred albums at the top in other streaming apps."
"this app was fantastic but now whenever I try to change song in car via steering buttons, it just crashes and restarts. can you guys look into it? I have paid one time annual fee and this is happening constantly. just check if there is a fixable issue please. not rating bad cuz it seems like a technical issue."
Nice and smooth. Student discount is a nice touch. Some tracks are missing which might be available on YT. Overall better UI than Apple Music.
"I like it so much, but I would really like you to improve a ""Sleep"" button, Google Music has it, I dont get why you don't, so I could listen to my music and fall asleep without having to wake up again to stop the music üòÇüòÇ"
"Please help, my offline songs keep getting unsaved when I phone restarts. I have to keep downloading them again every time. I own a Samsung S9 on Android 9 One UI"
"Spotify is the one! so fluid and seamless with regular updates providing more and more good stuff! Up to date songs every week, Thank you Spotify"
I can't find the repeat button or option anywhere in the app. Not even in the settings menu. I don't know if I'm the only one facing this issue or there's no song repeat option whatsoever. Kinda annoying.
"Excellent so far, and I'm finding it simple to use. I usually search for music but did find a playlist that really suits my tastes. Keep up the good work!"
when I travel overseas and occasionally in the USA I'm unable to play some of my music groups. I was told the maximum number of songs were 3333. therefore none of my songs should require redownloading because I am under that number.
UI & UX is good when we opt for Premium Version it gets bigger and so good to use. It's like a Netflix for Audio Streaming but tracks are not available give it soon.
"UI can be better, the app is a bit slow so needs to be corrected by making it more smooth. And the main thing it lacks a lot of songs.... like a lot and also the song updates a bit late in this where as other platforms have already had so this is quite disappointing."
"so far so good, haven't had any issues with this version. Simple and intuitive to use...makes going back to loading music manually onto the phone a chore"
"Great ""free"" platform to listen to music and build a comprehensive library in the process. The ads suck but it is free and easily rid of said ads by simply buying a subscription."
"Spotify is legit. I just wish they'd quit removing songs from their servers. I'm sure its for copyright/plagiarizing purposes, but there arr so many cool songs that I have to download on my laptop, which sacrifices playing those tracks on mobile."
I love Spotify premium. i use it everyday and i am a very diverse listener so saying they have almost all the music i listen to is saying a lot and they even generate playlists of music that u like and frequent with music uve never heard or they hit u with a throwback youve forgotten about. and they tend to be more on point than other music apps ive had. only complaints i have are that they dont have Tool and they are missing quite a few underground colab songs that gey dropped but overall loveit
"Songs not available in my country is a bit of a bummer, they appear greyed out. Also, app should allow transferring downloaded songs to the SD card, as sizes can become extremely big and unbearable for internal memory. Overall, good selection of tracks, good quality, offline play is great, songs stream quickly so if you lose signal for a minute you're not bring interrupted."
"I get access to all the latest songs in good quality. I personally feel like the steaming quality is a tad less than spotify-downloaded music which is subsequently less in quality compared to music played on your phone's default music player. The difference is quite negligible, but it'll irk the 5% of hardcore audiophiles out there. Also u dont get access to spotify-downloaded music on your stock music player, its stuck within the spotify app, thought u should know."
I LOVE the app dearly but i HATE One thing the most!! THE ADS!! It pops up whenever you are listening to good music and chilling. The ads are so annoying and you can't even skip it. I throw my headphones whenever it pops up. Really Pissed up. For that I have deducted 1 Star. Please bring some change in ads like make it a musical melody or just give us the SKIP button. I'm sorry. I'm not up for Premium.
No doubt its best app but few issues are there. 1. Main song screen has resizing issue. not the main app screen but when on the Song Playing screen we transition it glitches and does resizing every single time. 2. If i pause the song for more than 30 seconds or something app gets killed. i can no longer play the song back using headset button or Samsung Gear Sport smartwatch. I have OnePlus 6T with the most recent software.
I wanted this app from a long time but the app was not available in some countries including India but thanks to you that this is available in India UI of the is superb and quality is awesome even the basic High quality is good iny opinion this is the best music streaming app.
"In India at long last, and I have to say, the autoplay (or song suggestion, whatever you want to call it) algorithm here has to be the best of any app I've used so far. For people like me who love streaming, this is the be all end all. It doesn't quite have every tune in the universe, though - I was amazed to find The Expanse's ost here but The Lord of the Rings has oddly gone missing."
"Spotify is my favorite app/product/service of any kind. Not only is it strong on the basics (massive music library, strong UX, ability to collaborate on playlists, etc) it also is amazing for podcasts and music discovery. Discover weekly, suggested playlist additions, curated playlists, etc all help find new music thatbreally works!"
it doesn't feel like a proper version .. i saw a better spotify app in the us version.. need to improve the UI.. make it feel like us Spotify.. regards.
"Its haven't even been 24 hours and i am loving it. its just launched in india and i am glad it did after a long wait. i have used many streaming service, Spotify is best in all of them User interface, app fluidity,stability, User friendly, easy to interect, huge library, best playlists (especially the 90's rock one), wireless mirroring directly to all the smart TV's, podcasts, Concert perfomances, everything you can possibly ask in a single music streaming service, Spotify have it. Loving it.üëçüëå"
Exceptional music app ever. It would be great if a alarm clock function can be built into it so that a song can be play while waking up in the morning / etc.
"been using mobile app, and desktop app for a year and half now. Mobile is reliable but still lacks the ability to edit playlist description, and photo, the ability to sort/organize all of your playlists is not possible on mobile. In overall the mobile app gives me the feeling of ""application abandonment"" by Spotify, as you need to have the desktop app to to access features that should be available on the mobile app, and after doing a couple quick searches apparently its been like ths 4a cple yrs"
"So far so good, I'm enjoying this app quite much. I specially like the fact that I don't have to have a lot of my phone's memory space consumed by downloaded music. But I do wish that there was more variety options with the plans."
"WOW! I am just blown away by the wide variety of options present in here. I just moved here from sound cloud and woah, this app is GOLDEN. It has got sounds for the music lovers for all types of genres and the quality is unreal, yes! it's freaking amazing. The eq option is an option that I really missed in sound cloud but is present here. The UI is brilliantly clean although gestures would be a great addition, such as swipe up and down to switch between the home to the ""now playing"" menu."
Spotify is one of the best music applications which I have used till now. It is very responsive. It has all popular tracks. UI is also very nice.
Whenever I open my playlist I can't find my shuffle play button. There is a heart and a minus sign but no shuffle and repeat button. Please fix. Also i cant link spotify to Google assistant.
"for me, ios spotify was much simple. I know they both similar but I can feel few differences like when I want to swipe down the song I have to use the button which is located at the top left, why can't Just swipe it down?"
Absolutely flawless UI. No issues downloading or streaming. Really useful to include audio quality settings and all the abilities to edit things.
Finally it's in India. Have been waiting for Spotify to launch in India for a long time now. Simply the best in music recommendations and the UI looks super sexy. I am in love with this app.
really great app for listening songs. I just love the quality of the songs and the app UI is really great. playlists are really so great. I like every part of it. I was waiting for it from a long time and now I'm so happy and satisfied.
amazing music app. found everything I was looking for in top quality streaming. downloads are quick and easy for offline mode listening as well. in spotify I trust!
"In my opinion, spotify is the best choice for music streaming. period. The design is clean and the way it functions is very good. There are some downsides though to spotify. The app can be really glitchy at times and that could get a bit frustrating. Overall, its a good app and service (with premium because with free theres lots of restrictions)"
"Not bad overall. Good UI, good sound quality. As a free user, I sure don't mind ads, but on mobile version playing the desired songs should be an available function. Playlist problems: adding the new songs to the top of the playlist and set specific persons I want to collaborate on a playlist with are needed."
I subscribe and pay like $13 ! month for a Spotify and Hulu combo pack.. love it.. couldn't be happier! There are some artists it doesn't have quite yet but most of today's music and most popular artists are there :) check it out!
"great, no issues, easy to use and relatively quick to download songs for offline mode on my phone. only glitch is sometimes my phone app doesn't sync with my laptop!"
"very clever playlists based upon my favorite musicians. also everything in the app works pretty well, with quick responses to everything, every comand, every request. congratulations!"
"Spotify is one of the absolute best music experiences on the market right now. I have used other services, which are good but Spotify is far more superior. The algorithm's it uses to build you playlists are amazing. Your music review they create for each account is fantastic. All around I give Spotify a solid 10/10 I'm quite happy with my service and will continue to be a solid promoter of it."
love the app and the podcast on there. great place to get all music and podcast for myself. what I think would be a good idea is a like and dislike button for podcasts. this way listeners can let the podcasts aware if users liked or disliked a certain episode.
"Great music app with ability to download songs, losts of songs and great reccommendations. would be great to have inbuilt feature for saving a song by listening to it, like shazam"
Not a lot of songs you can't find on here and picks up the music selection that suits your taste really fast. Love the discover weekly selection!
"I have been using Spotify since the servicd was in Beta and have never since then, not had a premium membership. It is a fantastic service. The app however does still require some fine tuning, not having features like searching in playlists, friends section to find their playlists or what theyre listening."
"It is really easy to use and have a good design. However, I still have to download songs all over again when I install this app from a new device or my premium runs out (I used giftcard once). Despite this problem, this is such a great music app and I suggest you to use this."
"i am sure the competition have similar libraries, the difference to me, is the intuitive-ness of spotify's application to monitor my music preferences thus, send me music recommendations based on what i listened."
best music app ever. This amazing app has allowed me to build a collection of music thats better than ive ever had in the past. its brought music back into my everyday life like never befire
"Spotify, especially Premium Family is perfect for any music lover! You can make so many music lists so that you always have exacty the music you need at the push of a button! Try it today!!!"
"I love Spotify, however I'm using a Huawei P9 lite and when i search for a band in my playlist e.g. The Wombats. I play one of their songs which is great but when the song ends, it should play the next wombat song. Although, it doesn't, I have tried messing around with the settings and buttons, had no luck. Any help would be appreciated"
"first 5/5 I've given Spotify is so great. I can create playlists then after it finishes playing you have the option of it continuing playing music similar to those songs. it creates 5 different playlists, daily, with the songs you added that are similar genres with one or two new songs that are also similar. there's too much to praise them about."
One of the best music apps ever. Everything I want in music since my first Walkman in 1980. First thing I downloaded to my new phone. All we need is a recognition button.
"Reopens the door to decades of lost music. Very acceptable sound quality, especially if you tweak your equipment. Recommended."
Is there an option to remove the videos? its ruining my experience of this app. I just want the artwork not MTV. It also stops you from viewing and editing the queue. It's a really poor feature.
"Simple and works great! Suggested small change: I think the settings button should be persistent across all sub menus and not only present in ""Your Library""."
"the app briefly lost a critical piece of functionality, ruining the user experience for me. It has been restored, and once again Spotify is my running buddy. It still acts weird with play queues, but I can deal with that, since it's clear the service's focus is on playlists and radio stations."
"No problem for songs so far, but I found out that sometimes when I am trying to play a downloaded podcast episode, the episode fails to play. It is quite easy to take care of, just by erasing the episode, force stopping the app, then redownloading; but still it is annoying."
love the fact I can have albums with the click of a button. great selection considering not a lot of the music I listen to is rereleased they still have plenty. only problem I really have is skipping. but that could be many things like bad phone or bad carrier. I love it
"did you actually remove the 'all songs added to library' tab? are you serious? i honestly don't understand why'd you do that, unless you want to make users hate you. please bring the tab back. i don't remember who made what song in which album (and those are, i'm quite certain, not the criteria by which people memorize the songs), and searching like that is extremely inefficient."
"LOVE Spotify ‚ù£‚ù£ especially since we have the family premium. perfect for our family of 5. No kids arguing over sharing an account. our 3 daughters,my husband and I have our own accounts and best of all much more songs available and more affordable then pandora. we were so limited with songs on pandora and the price not worth it plus each account had to be paid separately, no thank you. Spotify is the way to go üòçü§©"
AMAZING!!! I can listen to every song by Queen with a touch of a button. I absolutely love Spotify. I probably couldn't live without it.üòçüòä‚ù§üé∂üéß
"Spotify is a classic, they've been in the game for years and played it well. for the most part I love the app, the ability to seamlessly switch between devices while continuing the same playlist is something I've used to great convenience and all the buttons are in places that logically make sense to me However, a recent update - involving moving gifs on songs - occasionally removes the only access button to the play queue during those songs with moving images, which is incredibly infuriating."
"I love Spotify. The perfect music experience in an app. Excellent interface, great song suggestions based on your listening habits, and all around great design."
Good music app it is the best one out there. Some useless ads which are annoying but they're just a minor nuisance now and then.
"really great experience with spotify!!!! I like that there are ads, but there aren't so many ads within playlists that ruin the whole experience!!!!!"
"Spotify is a pretty amazing app, i love using it and the way it connects to ur gaming systems and gives u so much qualtiy control from equalizer to file kbps rate is just awesome. I have premuim and really enjoy it."
"i love spotify this app has any song you like.For example, billie eillish,cumbia,hip hop different song and if u drive and hear music at the same time i promise it feels like a dream happening. for me it did. no adds but if u listen to one commercail u get 30 min of add free music and if u buy premium you can hear muisc when ur driving if u have no wifi its pretty cool. i honestly rate this 5 stars."
Honestly it's the best place to find high quality music. UI is easy to use and aesthetically pleasing! The free version of this app is hardcore bad though but I understand the need to make money so whatever. Good app.
I have found just about everything I want on here so far and i love the organization of it. The only reason its not 5 stars is because they have some kind of feature that keeps the music quieter when I Bluetooth to my car or head phones.
"App is fine, but it would be great to have a folder where you could access the music you've downloaded to your phone quickly without having to go through your playlists/albums!"
"Every 30min. or so they'll show a short commercial U have to get through,but to listen to almost anything anytime with only a cell is pretty cool. My data does seem to vanish pretty quickly though."
"love it. designs playlists based off what youve listened to, has almost all the stuff i listen to. the music is limited to mostly english music only. add music in other lsnguages (french, japanese, spanish, etc) ill rause my rating to 5 stars."
"the amount of adds is a piss off every 30 minutes so you only get about 3 or 4 songs inbetween adds and they go for quiet a while, and not being able to download the music unless u r a premium member is wrong. I was a premium member but I was being bill for 3 subs because i had it on 3 different devices and didn't realise for over 6 months so it was costing me close on $ 45 - a month. I was pissed off to say the least but was unable to contact spotify to inform them and possibly get premium memb"
Everything you need and more! The app is so fluid on any of my devices new and old. Spotify has been killing it for years and I will always continue to use it.
"This is a great app. It works with your PS4 & puts mixes together based on what you listen to & like. My only complaint is they just simply don't have the amount of music that an app of this magnitude should have. There are quite a few songs I have tried to find such as Freddie Gibbs Sellin' Dope, (for example) that they just don't have."
"I've been using spotify for a while now and to be honest i really love it and been using it everyday.But there are still many problems,for example,i noticed Spotify drain my battery a lot even when it's offline,Spotify UI is amazing but i don't know why there are some features on the pc version is not available on mobile especially karaoke mode and i think the search bar in playlist should be always on and more importantly some classic songs that i search is not available."
This is the equivalent of radio station that only plays the music you like. I have discovered a few new artists via their recommendations. Wouldn't be without now.
"We've been fans & a patron of Spotify for several years now. We're definitlely gratful for all this service offers, for patrons and artists. It's our underaranding that Spotify has earned little profit. If this is the case, acknowledging the reality that the business still exists and has grown over the years too offers testiment to the dedication of Spotifys founders to supporting the music industry from a place of valuing and appreciating the musical arts tremendously. üôè‚ú®üíöüå†"
Simple and minimalistic design! This music service is easy to use and is worth the monthly subscription! everything works perfectly and i rarely have issues.
"I'm a huge fan of this app, the only thing that keeps bothering me every single day is that some songs are way louder than others, they almost feel distorted (eg the whole Album Hot Fuss by the Killers). The ""Normalize Volume"" button in the settings does nothing about it unfortunately."
"Never write reviews in Play Store. But with this app I'm really getting happier every week. Last months changes significantly improved music suggestion algorithms (or is it because I started to push like/dislike song more often) and already for around 6 weeks I genuinely enjoy at least 3/4th of the Discover Weekly playlist. Fresh music and endorphines every week! Thanks a lot for your work, guys!"
"great service, great app, very nice UI. but not without its problems. last versions have been causing huge battery drain on my phone. also, it got very slow. even on 4g connections. also, it makes you wait when you want to listen to downloaded music on slow connection while it's loading"
"Having been a paying member for like 4 or maybe more years now, (which since im a cheapskate I don't do lightly) i can honestly say spotify is probably the best music apps there is. It has great common sense to it in terms of user friendliness- basically it is really easy to do what you want in terms of finding, playing and organising songs etc. It seems like a lot of thought has gone into making the best user experience, and semi regular updates keep that true. Spotify is a real G."
"Very good music app. No hidden fees, ads are short and not frequent enough to ruin the musical experience. I highly recomend Spotify."
I've used Spotify since college. As an educator I really enjoy being able to quickly find songs appropriate to my lessons or to an ensemble performance. Highly recommended.
personally I love the app great selection and all however... I cant use my debit card to pay for premium and it's quite annoying. I'd love to get premium but dont have and dont want a credit card sooooo... yeah. again I'd love to get premium but I cant....
The features are very intuitive and surprisingly helpful. Seeking the next song loads very fast. Very enjoyable to use.
"As an avid music content consumer, I was almost immediately sold on the concept and have been a Premium customer for a number of years. A few UX suggestions: ‚Ä¢ Please look into the ability to remove a track from a playlist, while ON the track card. Currently have to either sieve thru the playlist, locate it, then remove; or use the search bar ‚Ä¢ Stop advertising new music on a pop up screen for artists (who are mainly irrelevant to my playlists) - I have Premium to avoid obnoxious popup Ads"
"love the dark theme, nice and intuitive to use. my one criticism is just that you're unable to swipe on a song to the right to queue it on android, like i could on my old iphone. would love to see that feature integrated on android as well :)"
"intuitive and simple application. however there are a number of gaps. for example, I am unable to add podcast to a playlist"
"Honestly for me as a developer who uses many platforms i love the fact you can seemlessly sync your current song across EVERY. SINGLE. OPERATING SYSTEM. they not only have linux snap but also a snazzy web app. works great on wear OS and windows and those icky apple things too. Oh it sounds excellent too, and i havent been able to find an artist yet!"
"Came back from Amazon Music as the UI is slicker, works better with Android auto and is more compatible with smart home hubs. Also better features. Now have family plan too. Flawless performance. Quite happy."
"spotify has a 50% off for students that go to university which is great but what about highschool? highschool is one of the most stressful things, and the worst thing happening is that its finals week and your parents wont pay $10 for premium!! bit frustrating? sure university/college students need to pay for taxes and mortage. but maybe highschool should be saving up for future school tuition NOT $10 for premium. thanks premium please update"
"Good quality music, however if you do not have premium it does use up a lot of data. Also it is quite hard to find playlists."
"excellent streaming app! perfect for anything, and everything music-related. all songs, all genres, all of it is available on spotify!! graphics display, info, personalization are all welcome bonuses. overall, pretty near perfect!!! so easy to use, and i deff recommend downloading :))"
"When I tried to play music in Samsung Music on Spotify tab, it opens Spotify apps instead of playing directly in Samsung Music. I love both Spotify great song recommendation and Samsung Music great UI plus edge lighting so true Spotify integration would be great even if it were limited to premium users because I'm a premium user myself. As a premium user, ads are of no concern so true integration without redirection to Spotify wouldn't hurt right?"
"i review spotify with 4 Stars because I face a unsolvable problem with equalizer. If someone have faced the same problem and and solved it,please read below and help me .When i use the application from my car's source the volume is really low , while coincidentally , when i change to FM , without any change to the options of equalizer, the volume is higher about 40%. The same problem appears also while i connect AUX. I tried to change the loudness from interior menu of spotify without any result."
"The app is okay, "" upgrading to premium for seamless streaming of my favorite songs and artists.. I can get with that!"". My only issue is when i stream my spotify to a gaming console Via wifi; It seems to cut out or fade when the bass plays in most songs. 4/5 stars seems a little gratuitus."
Best music app ever designed. Low bandwidth high quality sound... Would be nice to have video on it. Ideal car cars. Better than any radio station
"I absolutely love spotify. You can't beat $10 a month for what you get. Music is great. UI is great. They make Pandora and Serius XM look like a waste of money. I can't wait to see Spotify more heavily embedded in things like car audio, because it is about all I listen to."
"great app, but in my opinion, needs a ""quick add to playlist"" button where it auto adds the song to a playlist set up previous, so if you press the button it doesnt take you to the ""select a playlist"" page"
"I really like this application. It's not quite as nice as the PC client, but it still gives a good experience. And $10 per month for all the music I love with no ads is a great price."
I highly recommend spotify to anyone trying to find a music app. Free to listen to songs. One suggestion though. Having a play button as well as the shuffle would be nice. I know this is possible with spotify premium but making this a possibility without spotify premium is one of my top suggestions. Great app!
I used Deezer for about 6 months before this. Spotify has better playlists but there are things that the Deezer app did better than the Spotify app. I quite like the feature of being able to pause and play from a different device over the internet (even if I never use it).
Really love Spotify. Super easy to find the music I like. The app offers good recommendations also. Tried Amazon music but quickly came back to Spotify. Plus they gave me a free Google mini.
Have been using Spotify for a couple weeks now. So great! Love the curated playlists and how it becomes more intuitive as I keep interacting. It would be awesome if you could get song lyrics as you're listening (and singing along!)
"Annoying that you have to pay for it, but I guess all good things must be earned! Regardless, quite compact to store and carry my music wherever I travel."
it's great I have premium so I get offline music which is great for snowboarding but the only con I have is the sort button they need to bring it back instead of going through a menu.
Great service with a lot of flexibility compared to other streaming services and large amount of devices support it which gives you more use out of this service and has great quality music. The user experience is excellent at most with small features to help the user save data if on a mobile plan.
"being old school with music delivery and never having a device suitable for download etc I had not really explored Spotify. best Christmas present ever is my new tablet, having a week off work, I discovered that my favourite radio station has the one play list on repeat day in day out. SPOTIFY HAS OPENED MY EYES, choice and control and some excellent memories are reignited! I love it!"
"Like to listen to a wide variety of music, spotify is the ticket, simple,straight forward in the process, fexible in building different playlist, and choices are a plenty! well done spotify take a bow! üòâ‚úå"
"The interface is a bit clumsy on the app (compared to the desktop version). Searching by criteria (geography, genre etc.) is a bit difficult. Integration with other devices is often unintuitive. I do enjoy the recommendations."
This is the most amazing app ever. The playlist they build basd on the songs you listen to is the fantastic. I havent heard a song I dont like on this app in like three months. Whoever created Spotify created a masterpiece Thankyou
"Intuitive, great library selections and suggestions. Great user interface. Seemlessy play across devices around my home. Big ups for Spotify"
"I love the fact I can use this app and still use my phone to cruise the net, answer texts or schedule appointments on my calendar while it plays in the back ground on my wifi sound system."
"I was really anti Spotify for a while, having to pay for the privilege of listening to music I already have. Just went premium for 99p and it's completely blowing my mind. I'm discovering music every day, the interface is really intuitive, and saving music kind of feels like I'm keeping it. Game changer..."
"Oh man! I hate always choosing songs to play. With spotify, I just give them my type of music and I trust them in choosing the songs that suits my genre. üòâüéß"
I've used this app almost daily for over 2 years to build personal playlists and keep up with new album releases. The song recommendations have kept every day fresh and given me so many more artists to love. I have no idea how I lived without it before >‚àÜ<
I really love this app it is a easiest way to listen to music!! Ive traveled to many places and was still able to play the music I love!! I really reccomend spotify premuim as well it is a big help!
i absolutely love this service and its app. It runs smoothly and rarely glitches. It's a great way to build playlists and fibd new songs and artists.
its a good app with premium but wothout premium there are songs you cant listen to and quite a few adds but other then that it is a solid app but if your not looking to spend money go to soundcloud there are less ads.
I really like this app I can play my own music and create my playlist with many different artists. I just love the option of playing from my phone to my tv with just a push of the button
anniversary 1 yr premium. much love üòç spotify. found a lot of joy in music in 2018 with you. suggested enhancement : visualization for casting to television. ( love the mobile enhancement with visuals on select songs.) main suggestion... improve UI for edit of Playlist on mobile. not easy to search track in Playlist or remove or move. yuck. must fix.
excellent app and library. needs more equalizer options that are quickly accessible. shouldn't need to dig through several menus to access it. otherwise app works perfectly
"Very intuitive and easy to use, I can't believe I am only just using it now. Limitless collection, including international songs too!"
"Reliable when casting, good UI, easy to sample / listen to both new and old music and good value for money. What's not to like?"
"Great app. I'd like big buttons for playing an album (replacing the queue) or adding it to the queue when browsing an album, same for a playlist when browsing a playlist. Right now there's a lot of deleting of individual tracks when deciding to listen to another album."
Offers a great selection of music to suite for most people's interests. Very intuitive and beautiful app design. Love it!
Love that I can find my favourite songs and build them in my customized playlist. Being able to listen to them offline was a great feature.
"It's all good but there needs to be a shuffle button on the queue screen like it is on iOS. Hate going to my queue, checking the upcoming songs out, going back and pressing the shuffle button off and on, then checking the queue again. and repeating til I find a good order. Ya know?"
"Love spotify, never any issues and good value! Easy to use, I can listen to all my favourite music at the press of a button, love making playlists as well! üëçüéµüëå"
"I had android and Apple and I can say the Apple one is way smoother then the android one and it doesn't make sense why there not the same.the android on you have to always go to the top and press the menu button and press find in playlist if you want to find a song where as Apple you just swipe up and boom the search bar is there, kindof feels like there holding out on android.. Just my 2 cents still a solid platform for music one of the best of not the best but they held out on Android"
"Spotify offers a really good range of playlists tailored to my tastes from a broad range of artists that I'd never even heard of and provides quite a good representation, though not exhautive of what I like from progressive rock. It can get me everything I want but always offers a good range of music that I am actually very happy with especially for study and sleep."
Great variety of songs to choose from. Accurate recommendations. Only critique is that finding podcasts to play/download is difficult. The UI is overall very easy to navigate.
"LOVE this app! Any song I can think of, Spotify has it. I can quickly download, create a playlist, and then relax and listen for hours! 5 stars definitely!!!"
"Best streaming service, app needs to mature somewhat. Browsing music is not as intuitive as it should be. Love being able to send my mudic to different devices in the house."
Love it!! had pandora but its annoying that i could never just search and listen to one song. spotify i can search for a particular song and build custom playlists of songs i want and from recommendations from spotify!!
"Cleanest UI, most complete collection of music, and most enjoyable music subscription service I've used, and I've used Amazon Music, Google Play Music, and YouTube Music."
"Really like the built in playlists based off music genre, activity, etc. and the option to create your own. All positive experience so far."
"The best user experience music app out there, But without hi res sound can't compete with the rest. Waiting for this to happen asap!!!!!!!!"
The app getting stuck in offline mode has been an existing issue for over 2 years now. Spotify has STILL not resolved this issue that CONSTANTLY happens where even with wifi and signal your app will get stuck in offline mode. Simply adding a function button saying 'Go Online' would fix this but NOPE. The 30bil market cap company can't figure it out. I'm days from selling my stock and switching to Apple. This is ridiculous.
"Using the app for almost 2 years. Overall good user experience. Only came across one minor glitch, which was fixed. There is some music from certain artists unavilable on Spotify."
"very good, but the ads need to be toned down a bit, playing two 30 second ads (sometimes up to 4) back to back really ruins the experience"
Spotify is a great app and I reckon everyone will love all the cool features as well as the app itself. The only things that needs improvement would be the downloading be cause it can be quite slow at times and the details on the songs. Apart from those the app is awesome and if ur thinkig of getting it I would recommend it for sure!
"Everything I wanted and more. Building playlists, experiencing new music are both excellent. Well done navigation. Excellent sound quality. Highly recommend."
"all the ads are incredibly annoying and completely ruin the experience, until you buy spotify premium. That was the best app purchase I've ever made and I use spotify constantly now. Love it! - I know that sounds like an advertisement, but seriously, if you like music, just do it."
One of the better music streaming apps. I enjoy how seemless it works cross-device (ie. playing a song on your computer from where it left off on your phone) and the auto-playlists are quite on point. My only gripe is the lack of Widgetry - refer to Black Player for a how to on that front.
Love spotify but i hope one day they will add an alarm button so u pick a song and the time wait for the current time and boom the song u chose will ring bc some people find it hard downloading songs for ringtones on their phone so to me the alarm button would be helpful.üëçüëç
spotify is the best music app ever. it is free for all listeners and there's no subscription required. although if you do want to pay you can get offline music and a lot of other benefits.
"It's really nice and I would really want to advice everyone to go for premium. You can listen to music even without an internet connection and the downloads are not a problem. Before everything else, I think the best part about Spotify is that it's legal. You can listen to your favorite artists guilt free, knowing at the back of your mind that your helping them as well."
its great but i dont undsrstand why it skips through the song when i tap the power button.... this just started about 2 weeks ago and i dont know how to fix it. i will rate 5 stars for fix in next update
"Artist deep dive during sign up is extremely interesting and found some real gems that hard to find and even harder to remember, but when you see them it's like meeting an old friend again. Wish the mood selections were built more like theme genres then emotional moods (montage theme for desk job vs happy at work). Decent derivative shuffle so songs do stay in same vein well together. Wish it co-existed or paired it's strengths with Google Music because they both do good in the others weakness"
"Amazing, no matter what you require and whoever music wise spotify is without doubt the best app out there...with lyrics and the history behind the artist aswell its sure brilliant.."
"I actually quite enjoy Spotify! I use it both on my phone, game console, and computer! I just wish it wasn't so expensive to use Premium, especially since I'm on a budget. I only pay for it, because I hate ads in after every other song."
"UI is mostly great, I only get confused where to find stuff every once in a while. The download to device premium feature has been amazing and is the reason I purchased it."
Love it! Easy interface and lovely design. Would recommend to anyone who loves organization and appealing visuals. Very cheap as well.
"It's a nice app for you to listen to music on, but I can only shuffle play when I'm on my phone, which can get in the way. I may be missing a setting but I think the original setting should have it to play in order first. If I'm listening to songs that require to listen in order to get what it means (like musicals) I can't listen to them in order, which gets in the way sometimes, but some songs I just like to listen to in order if they're from a video game that I like."
"Awesome app for music, especially since they offer a student discount with hulu included. Just wish they let you add a whole playlist into another playlist and made sorting them easier, the recent update ruined the navigation"
Its really good for new albums and music and if you don't want to have some adds in your music check out the quick add for thirty minuets also if you don't have the time to listen to Spotify check out amazon music its just as goodüëçüëçüëç
Great UX! Just really wish there were an option to use the 15 sec forward and backward while listening to music (this can be done when listening to podcasts in this app)
"It's better than play music because, I can just push the song I want and just plays instantly but , I have to push the play button over and over on Google play music and that's why I like spotify."
"Great app and can mostly find the music I'm looking for but my only problem is that when you're listening to a song in the ""All Songs"" part of Your Library there should be a button to press that takes you straight to the song in that playlist that you were last listening to when you closed the app or you just get taken straight back to that spot in the playlists once opening said playlist"
"i love this app! if you dont wnat to pay for premium, you can get the app on your labtop and skip, go back a song, and pick the song you want. you can do almost everything that has premmuim on you computer, ezcept to doen lode stuff/songs and you do have to lissen to some ads"
"Love this app with my heart especially as a student with the 4.99 discount that includes premium, showtime, and Hulu. My only complaint atm is that you guys removed the filter button at the top of a playlist so now I have to go to the menu to choose the find in playlist button which is just super annoying."
It was a great app until they got rid of the search bar at the top of your own playlist and instead replace it with a 'Find in playlist' option in the menu bar! Also the scroll button being at the very top of the playlist is null as it always open the menu unless you scroll down a little! Annoying!
"The free user experience: The ""FREE"" version is usually one of the most unsatisfying experience of any given paid app,I need not to explain further. In Spotify's case, it's one of the fairest experiences with other music apps I have ever encountered. It gives enough freedom to do things you would ever need and has mini demos for the premium version. The paid user experience: Hands down one of the best premium music streaming service ever. HIGHLY recommend for those who love to listen to mainstream songs. Customer supoort: I have never in my entirety on this good flat planet received better or even rmotely close to the Spotify customer support. Honestly one of the best things about Spotify. TL;DR: 10/10"
"Basically happy with it, but there's always room for improvement. Like building a true Randomizer for shuffled play. Too often you hear the same songs..."
"For some reason the song listed on my notification bar isn't the song that's actually playing, and this is an issue that's been happening for quite a few days now. Other than that, the app's great."
"Spotify is the best music platform, in my opinion. They put a lot of effort into playlist that suit your tastes, and spotfiy premium downloading is smooth. :)"
"Spotify is excellent. Almost all the songs are here..and knows what a person what music suits best for them...payment wise, i hope we could pay easily with our load account. Thanks and more power!"
"My app of choice for music. Aside from a few of the benefits from having a subscription, it's got a decent UI and innate dark mode. Great selection of music, probably one of the better mainstream services for finding SOME obscure songs, but definitely not all."
"exquisite. Weekly and daily, different songs in recommended playlists. It's good, for people listens to other songs that isnt trending, it's like-new,even if its already out in the market LoLz..PeAcE!"
"its the best music player hands down i have been using this on every platform i have , PC,xbox,mobile they all work the same with just the difference of the interface which is ok and i love the dark and green theme it suits me as a dark theme guy and just the amount of songs in spotify's music library is by far the largest i have experienced and they have got every official release in as soon as it comes out i would just ask to add more unofficial songs like some remixes of some songs aren't present but that's only 3% of my music so it wouldn't annoy anybody overall thanks Spotify for such a great service"
"Good app. Only problem (yes I have pressed the shuffle button) my playlist is not shuffling, it is so frustrating. I press shuffle play, does not shuffle either."
I just really started using it today so I can't really say as far as recommendations it wouldn't be able to give me any yet probably but I really love all the selections that I have in unable to experience new music at the touch of a button.
"Great app, such a nice and easy way to get to all your favourite artists. There are some features that might be better though, it is quite difficult to make playlists. It would be nice if you could turn your queue into a play list"
Excellent app but PLEASE dont erase the quick option to search songs inside playlist. Now you have to follow three steps to search a song. Two weaks ago you had the option of searching above your playlist.
"If there was an Application Mount Rushmore, Spotify would be all 4 heads, and they would currently be sculpting a fifth just to put them in there again. No app will ever live up the majesty, efficiency, altruistic, and benevelonce that this app provides. Using any other music streaming app is not only a disservice to yourself, but to the greater good of the music loving world."
I love using Spotify and have for a while a now. I've noticed that the search tab at the top of the playlists is gone though and I'd really like to have it back. Having to take that extra step to search for the button to search a song seems a bit much.
A quick tutorial option would be great. A visual guide that remains active if you want it for those a little technological impaired üòÇ
Have been using it for years and I really love it! Its so easy to build playlists and i especially like the download option. Its really great for long car rides or any place you may go that dosent have the greatest wifi or data connection.
"I love this app. However, when given to get 30 minutes of ad free listening for one ad, hit ""No thanks."" Apparently 30 minutes is equivalent to two songs."
"I love Sporify, but the app is not intuitive for me to use it. Also ot has problems with connectivity, often shows that it is offline, but the internet is on."
"A great way to stream all your favorite music! The new update looks quite appealing, and the student discount makes this a great value for students to listen to music while studying or anything else!"
"Spotify is a great service, whether you have a premium account or are listening free. While it doesn't feature *every* artist, it features a heck of a lot, whether you're a fan of pop or more underground artists. I have had no difficulties finding my favorite performers, and Spotify's even turned me on to quite a few I'd never heard of before, like The Cog is Dead. They've also got a ton of great podcasts like NoSleep, Scary Stories Told in the Dark, and We're Alive. Seriously, Spotify's damn good stuff."
"Why it's really often that the song stopped about 1 or 2 second before the song completed and then the song wont next unless we press the next button by outself? It reduces the chance we can skip 6 song in one hour, please fix"
"Best music app overall, have tried quite a few but this is the best one yet. Perfect layout easy to use very simple. So much music of all kinds. Even discovered artist I've never heard of. Best music app love it!!! Would give 10 stars of I could."
"I like the app and been a premium subscriber. I like how I used to be able to sort a playlist very quickly with 1 button, but recent updates make it that I have to click on the three dots, scroll down then click sort. Please bring it back to the fast and easy way"
Everything I'm looking for in a premium music streaming app except lyrics and 2 buttons (one for fast-forward 10 seconds and the other to rewind 10 seconds)
The best music streaming app. You can find basically any song you could think of. It's extremely quick and the quality Is perfect. Amazing.
Quick and simple to navigate. Downloading is a great option for when offline. Enriching the holiday experience!
I am so impressed with spotify. I love that there are zero interruptions. I can quickly load the queue list with my favorite songs.
"Suggestion: You should add a Download button for a single song, instead of saving the whole playlist or album for offline streaming just to acquire that specific song."
"Would prefer the interface to be a bit more fluid, like that of the IOS version where you can swipe to add songs to queue etc. But apart from that it's perfect üíú"
"Spotify is my best companion. Love the usability, the intuitive interface, the overwhelming music offer and the customised approach which package music according to my tastes, listening habits and preferences. It's just great!"
"Spotify is an amazing app if you like listening to music and creating custom playlists. With the click of a button, you can download your music and listen to it anywhere. Spotify has a wide variety and many genres of music. Overall it's a great app! Definitely recommend :)"
"Most reliable, intelligent designed and easy usable streaming service out there. Premium is worth every penny. As for the android app itself, it uses minimal resources and can be used as a remote for other logged in Spotify instances, supports SD card downloads and is all together very intuitively designed without losing the possibility of detailed configuration and edits to your playlist."
"Great song suggestions, love checking my discover weekly every Monday. Used to have some GUI issues, but this past year's updates have really improved the interface. Wish every artist would put their songs on Spotify!"
"This app has changed. my whole listening habit .l can listen to all music I tried to listen to on the light programme , home service and. Luxembourg, nearly 70years ago.Absolutely great .Thanks"
Its a really good app just make it more clear hoe to download individual songs and not the entire album lake place a small tick next to the song to download rather then a save button hidden away
This app is awsome ..iv used dezzer always .and Amazon'.however prefer the old Spotify now my self ..also produce music my self and design sounds and samples so will be hitting Spotify with them real soon lol. Thanks guys for excellent service cheers
"I like the app quite a bit but the whole paying for premium to get skips is kinda stupid, and the adds like boi chill with the adds. But if you do pay for premium it's a good decision."
"Can you make purchases available via phone balance with phone porviders in Saudia Arabia? This feature is already used and applied in other applications. I know many friends and family and other people who don't own a dept card or a visa that would love to have this feature so they and myself could enjoy the amazing premium features and its luxury. Please take this in to consideration, much appreciated."
"Great selection of artists. Quite good at guessing what I'll like. There's ads, but fewer than on the radio, so they don't bother me all that much."
I love Spotify. Been using it consistently for over a year and it's given me nothing but great music. The algorithms it uses to recommend new music suited to me are very accurate
"PRO: Perfect for variety, Larin dance and yoga classes I teach. Can make several playlists, can set the space or time between songs, can set up a on the spot playlist with queuing. I upgraded to Premium because of my regular need. It is sooo worth it and cheap. CON: 2018 songs are late in being available."
"Well designed, fairly minimal unnecessary notifications (ads). Content is good, although the Spotify recommendation engine doesn't seem to be as good as Pandora."
"Love how Spotify manages playlist and the latest recommendation of the songs really good, the simple UI makes it easy to use . Keep make it better"
"Ive been with Spotify premium for 3 years now! Love it to bits! Especially that it includes an equilizer which other apps or subscriptions do not (apple music, Google Play music)"
Awesome app. Can find any music quick and easy. Makes terrific playlists for you as well. Someone put together an incredible algorithm to pull thos all together.
"Spotify premium is great! I get it half price as I'm a student. I love all the playlists I can make as it suits my needs like walking to uni, or working out at the gym."
"Great app, although the latest update removed the feature where I could double tap the search button and start typing. Now I have to press search, then tap the actual search bar at the top, then type. Seems minute, but it's the little things ya feel me?"
"This app is intuitive, convenient, and has such a wide range of music and podcasts, that it's addictive as well."
"Way better than Apple Music, this gives users the chance to understand what they are buying. It offers a variety of music, unparalleled UI and famously drafted playlists that can relate to a users past experiences. All in all, a terrific app,and I would highly recommend purchasing premium."
I think every one should get this app even though it has some adds it is not that bad and you can pick more music if you want and if you don't like a song you can just press the button that has the line going through so I give this app a 10 out of 10 what do you guys give this app
"BIG love for this app!! I paid for premium version straight up and because I'm with Optus I get free music streaming with Spotify so it is absolutely awesome. I love that it shows you similar bands to the ones in your playlists. Can't rate this app high enough! So worth premium.. no adds and you get the luxury of downloading songs within the app for offline use. My kids and I listen to this all day every day, it's even got playlists for my toddler and baby. So worth it!"
"Spotify has all the music anybody could want, the the intuitive ability to suggest artists that may make you a new fan. I've broadened my list of music I enjoy with Spotify greatly over the past 3 or so years."
"Well designed, get what you pay for with a solid catalogue and good playlists and radios. Well-designed options and settings, and the 'very high' quality is decent. Would get 5 stars if would offer access to at least some live concerts at least by major artists - TIDAL are much better in this area. Thus, I like this app!"
"Good app with lots of musix variety, but please fix the randomise feature! It never gets through an entire playlist without recycling the same songs mutiple times. Atleast add an option to manually slide songs up and down your own created playlist, or a button that randomises the full playlist so you can then listen through chronologically, ensuring you hear all your songs. When I'm paying for the full version, these request really should be standard"
"Good but missing quite a few famous, well known songs which I'm surprised about as there are kareoke versions of the songs on spotify. Could certainly be improved."
I use Spotify daily and absolutely love having access to the millions of songs available. The interface is great and it's easy to get to songs that I'm looking for quickly.
"The content is great, design intuitive, and I love being able to explore so many diverse genres of music."
"This is a great music streaming app. Although, without premuim, you are pretty limited, so that temped me to purchase it. And it is TOTALY worth it. With premuim, this is the best music streaming app out there. I HIGHLY RECOMEND SPOTIFY (premuim)"
Spotify premium is the best music platform. Easiest to organise your own way but also intuitive to your music tastes. The best selection of music out there is spotify premium.
"Nice app and easy to use! The ads are understandable for the free version, but the only suggestion is to make them more suitable for the type of playlist people are listening to. I was listening to a ""sleep/relaxing"" playlist and got really annoyed by a noisy and loud ad."
Great for making exact paylists. Great for finding stations to find new related music. Cool suggestions. Good selection of chip tunes. More intuitive than Pandora.
"Spotify is a quick and easy way listen to music for FREE. However, ads can pop up, but not very often. Definitely a good place for music!"
"I love this app but the new ui makes it harder to find new music! I understand the drive to simplify everything in modern software, however you've just limited the app. All I can do now is scroll through genres or use the browse tab to find fresh beats. Besides that, great app. I use it on the daily"
Great music selection and auto adds to playlist in library. It's never difficult to find music to suit your mood.
Just subscribed to premium. It's good. Music is all in high quality even though I listen through a cheap headphone haha.. And the download is fast too. My complains is you should have settings to play only songs in search results in Playlist. And also let user skip song in the Playlist ui. Just my suggestions. üòäüòä
UI needs work. Distinguishing between downloaded and non-downloaded songs / playlists still isn't as easy as it should be.
"I really like Spotify but after a few last updates ""now playing"" notification doesn't work at all. Maybe it's caused by 8.1 android but hey, please fix it. It's annoying when I have every time when I need to pause or play music go into the app, Bluetooth headphones buttons doesn't do anything....in previous versions it worked well."
Free is for me. Ads a bit annoying though pruce is right (free). I will stop listening immediately if charges are ever required. Diverse music and wide variety.
Pretty good. I switched from Apple Music. I think the selection of playlists is one of the strong points. I also like how podcasts are built in.
Just difficult to change albums when teaching aqua aerobics!! I'd like to have button to tell me how to do these things!! a helpful hints area
"Spotify is my number one go to when listening to music on the Aux, its low data and battery usage make it an excellent way to blast tunes without having to worry about anything."
"I've only been using Spotify for a short time, however I do like the app quite a bit the ads aren't too long and the selections the song is pretty great for the most part. There's some older stuff or obscure stuff that's harder to find but still good."
"I've had Spotify for quite some time now and although the free version has ads the paid one does not and it's worth every penny, huge database and great music ""intuition"". Thanks guys!"
"I side it all the time, and I love it. But I really wish it had a built in sleep timer like Pandora and Audible and other streaming apps. I'd give 5 stars if they added it. But we've been asking for it for years, to no avail."
"Best Music streaming app. Some less known artists or certain albums are still missing but most things are there. Also missing some features, I would like a ""party mode"" where you can either lock it completely without entering password or allow quing but not changing playlist without the password. A feature to que playlists and/or temporarily combine playlists would also be cool."
"It's great at suggesting songs! You don't get unlimited skips with the free account, but i haven't even cared lol. Would give it 5 stars if 1) you could access settings from any screen, and then return to that screen with a tap of the back button. Currently you have to go to the home screen, then re-navigate back; 2) if you guys had gift cards!! Like Google Play; some of us don't use credit cards OR PayPal. If you guys had retail gift cards, i would absolutely switch to Premium, and make it my primary service over Google Play. Other than that, excellent app"
"Honestly I've been using spotify since the OG Rogers phone deal you could get a few years back and I haven't looked back since. Library has pretty much anything you need besides some underground stuff from like Soundcloud and the UI has done nothing but improve. Only real change I'd like to see in the future is maybe a way to view listening stats in the app with more stats being recorded than currently available. All in all the only music app I'll ever pay for, you have my loyalty spotify"
"It is lack of plenty of the most on-trend Chinese, and other songs. It also requires Premium account to unlock its worthiness. However, it can be a good application if it's opened to the Chinese country. I'll cause it to be a great platform with great amount of conveniences and lifestyle."
"Spotify on Android is a seamless, fluid pleasure that pumps music into my ears on demand. Connects flawlessly to all my devices, regardless of whether it's the car, Xbox, or Bluetooth speakers. The ability to download music and podcasts for offline listening makes for soothing and relaxing commutes."
"Nice. Works well. Although I have found that many artists complete works are not available. Found more on old MS Groove. Plus user interface needs some work, clean up, simplify, make navigation more intuitive, and add more artist background info."
"How a company deals with problems is a good reflection of how good the company is. The 8.4.75 update that was rolled out mid October made the app unusable on my Galaxy s8 with constant app crashes. I contacted them and was pleasantly surprised in how quick and responsive they were, e-mailing me back and providing feedback on how the fix was progressing. Once the 8.4.77 update, which solved the issue, was released I was offered a refund on my last month's subscription. Well done Spotify. You made an error but how you dealt with it more than made up for what happened."
"'New to this app. but V. impressed so far,. Pretty good shuffle lists with searched songs and quick results. 9.9/10. (Well Nothing's Perfect! ;-) ...... Is it?) ‚≠ê"
"This app is great for listening to music and making playlists. However, I wish that phone app's podcast features worked better. I wish for: automatically downloading X# of episodes (on/off wifi only) ""mark played/unplayed"" button, and retention of the ""sort by"" and ""show only unplayed""."
My favorite music app hands down! Love love love it! Never crashes and I find lots of new music to love. Make playlists to suit your moods or enter a mood or genre and find music to suit you. Perfect!
I do quite enjoy this app. I am able to find playlists for all sorts of moods. But I would wish we had the option where we can play songs from all the artists that we have as our favorite. It was alot easier to go to when I didn't know what I felt like listening to.
"Love Spotify, best decision I ever made when going premium. However, there are quite a few songs/bands I like that aren't on Spotify, I don't know why that is, but I've no clue how to do anything about it, if possible at all."
"Amazing, we use it pretty much everyday, music to suit everyones needs, our 2 year old loves the playlist I have made her, I listen to podcasts when doing house work and lately I have been obsessed with the beautiful piano playlists while cooking,showing and studying üëå"
I have been very pleased with Spotify since I went with their premium package. Before that there were too many ads which I guess served the purpose it was designed for and that is to aggravate me so much it would inspire me to invest in the premium package. Good app.
My most used app. Great design and the discovery playlists are great. Wish lyrics could be done in house but musixmatch is fine for now.
"Very powerful, full-featured app particularly amenable to genre and title tailoring as well as playlist development to suit the taste of every discriminating listener/user."
"I have enjoyed this app a lot through the years. Though what has happened to the ""browse and radio"" buttons on there. Its confusing and less ease of use"
Many new songs featured in Spotify compared with other apps. My best company during alone time. Always enjoying it to the max. The only down thing is it quite pricy for the premium future.
"The music selection is good but not as full on some areas as Google Play or Bandcamp for more independent artists. Overall it is a great player though, nice streamlined UI and quick to use"
It's perfect It has all the weird fringe rock and nu metal I love. Plus it pairs me up with tons of new stuff based on the good older rock It's easy to use It builds workout mixes for me around my music preferences And it gives you all your music based on a playlist so you can like songs or dislike them after you've gotten a chance to listen to them without breaking pace
"Perfect to use anywhere! What I love best is when I browse other apps, Spotify continues playing...unless I close the app or press the ""pause"" button."
"App is slightly glitchy. Sometimes says it's in offline mode and I can't search, but it isn't and I just deleted the app and redownload it. Happens quiet frequently on my Google pixel."
"First time i am actually reviewing. Its convenient, well designed, and completely worth the modest price. No more using youtube for music."
"The ads is quite annoying (free user) which i think its effective to get subscriptions. Tried to subscribe but had some issues with the payment. Other than that, great app!"
"So far very good. Sometimes while listening, abrupted by portions of another music & this ruins listening to the music of my choice. These are sudden interruptions which occurs depending on the music - like listening fragments of 2 songs simultaneously. Can't complain since it's free app."
"I like this app but feel ¬£9.99 is a little too much to pay for Premium. I recently had a problem with my account & the customer service was excellent, the problem was sorted out very quickly"
"App is great! I listen music all the time! Only problem I have is that if I'm using another app, it'll act as if Spotify isn't open and won't show what song is playing but it'll play the song. Quite annoying, but other than that it's wonderful!"
"A very good app where you can access all of your favourite songs whenever you like. All of this, in the touch of a button. AMAZING app"
"I love Spotify but please, when I click 'no thanks' on an ad - don't make me watch 2 full length ads. Seems a bit counter intuitive to say the least."
"Spotify is my favorite music streaming app. It has some falses such as very limited downloads (trough having premium, which is definitely worth it), it doesn't support Siri, Google Assistant... Spotify is slowly improving user experience and over app functionality. I think/hope many today's issues will be resolved in the future."
"Spotify is my new goto for all music from yesteryear to modern, the search is quick and direct. and the algorithm for recommendations is pretty good too and will only improve i believe, great app guys!"
"Easy UI, convenient and can listen songs even when offline. Looking for more songs and artists. Some of them not in the list."
"Great app, recently had some difficulty with it but support@spotify had it sorted in minutes üëç Have come across some great new music thanks to playlists designed based on what I listen to."
"It's Spotify. It has lots of good music. The UI could be dialed in a bit with Chromecast, but I don't know any other complaints about the app."
They told me they would never try to charge me for use of this app then told me I had to uninstall it from my device after they tryed to charge me. But that was when I was in Alaska. We shall see how it works in Louisiana. Great selection of music. If you can remember the name of the songs your in luck. That or they start you out on someone else play list.
"Absolutely the BEST music app out there! Spotify wins my vote, hands down! And the premium version is most definitely worth the small monthly fee. You have the ability to build as many playlists as your heart desires and its ad free. Plus the variety is astounding!"
"Yo I do love Spotify which is why I'm rating it as a 5, but for some reason theres now an older version of Spotify on this store? You can tell because the logo is using an older, less ""flat"" design and it's missing tons of features. It's kinda funny that some people haven't clocked on it's the wrong version haha. Either way you can get the latest ver on the Amazon store - so don't fret too much people."
Really good for customizing and making a playlist that has only your favorite songs. I think it allows quite a few skips on a playlist.
"Now I can listen to great songs while pooping, and I do mean it. I normally poop for a long time because of, I don't know because I'm not a doctor. I should have become a doctor if I study a bit hard, but everytime I got anxiety, I wanted to poops. You know how anxiety you'll get when you see blood. I can't even stand blood from a mosquito bite. And living in warm tropical country doesn't help much because there are alot of mosquito here. The warm weather made it hard for me to sleep at night, so I listen to Spotify then also..."
"Nice app for listening to music. Has a wide variety, and cool features like music queuing, and getting to see what my friends are listening."
Brilliant application! Great place for finding all your popular music ! Can be quite pricey but I'd recommend getting student discount ! You pay ¬£ 99 for the first 3 months then afterwards you pay only ¬£4.99 per month !!
"Spotify is great! I love the app, it's got a great UI and almost all the features of the browser version."
"I love that Spotify finds new music for me. I used to have to go to a club, or hope to get lucky on youtube. It has a hard time distinguishing between industrial and metal, though."
I think it's pretty good not thtavgreat guilty but it's good enough to listen and also where u can listen to music without Wi-Fi it would be 10 times better for be honest I still think it's pretty amazing though keep up the great worküòÅ
Over the last 4 years spotify has been my go to app for music. I couldn't be without it! It has hiccups every now and then but they are quickly fixed and it is a seamless application.
"App has a gr8 selection of off--beat alt jazz & classical as well as 60's/70's/big hair. $ is right. Never have issues with access, sound is gr8, site is easy to navigate. HOWEVER, site caters to the millenial crowd. There are other demographics with wallets. The AI Spot uses for song recommendations based upon my musical preferences isn't even close in most instances. I pay no attn to the social side of the site . Social is sooo 20 minutes ago LOL."
"It's quite difficult to get premium by using the app, I'm sure it's a bug on the app since my connection are fast enough. Other than that it's very good"
Great app. Always has the music you are looking for and everything is free. The only downfall is that it does require a connection unless you have premium. The premium is a great deal for a lot! Definently reccomend this for your music entertainment.
"I think Spotify is a great app for music, I have used Spotify for quite a while now and it's great to find the perfect music your looking for!"
The app itself is amazing! Very intuitive and great overall experience. Support team also very attentive and quick.
"I use spotify constantly. So incredibly well designed and easy to use, 100% recommend to anyone and everyone."
I prefer the ads over the inability to skip more than 5 songs on free version but I guess with premium you don't have either problem overall it is good to listen to music on I also quite like the podcasts
"Been using it for years! Easy to use, intuitive, clever! Love starting radios from tunes particularly, always learning about new artists a'la Pandora!"
"Tried all the music apps and this is by far the best and always has.been, links to tripple J app (Australian radio) and you can add the songs wherever you like, links with Sonos and Google home. Used to spend at least 80 quid a month on music and now a small price of 9.99 gets me all and more , honestly can not rate it enough."
"Could use a few more features like easier ways to get to artists without having to click through so many menus, and new filtering options. Something more modular would work better I think because it's a very text heavy UI, but overall it works good and there is huge selection"
"recommended by a friend, love it! room for improvement : a designated folder for downloaded songs for easy access when no data üòÅ"
Very easy to use stays playing music when screen is off so it can save battery and time easy playlist builder and millions of songs not just mainstream songs you hear on the radio.
"I have recently started using this app and it totally transformed the way I now listen to music, building playlist is smoothe and effortless, work simultaneously with my GPS driving app, I love spotify...simply the best..!"
Spotify is an excellent way to compile playlists and find new artists. I've built up a solid group of artists in my daily listening. If you're looking for a clean and easy way to find music spotify is the way to go
Seriously the easiest way to listen to music. Listen to your favourites (and they'll be there don't worry) and you'll end up with suggestions that are pretty well matched with the stuff you like. I've found so many little known artists that I've fallen in love with and I wouldn't have known they existed otherwise. Worth the ten bucks a month!!! The app is intuitive and comprehensive. Recommended
"Game changer! Thank you. Only thing I miss that YouTube has is finding really fresh quirky new music - BBC Radio 6 promoted tracks for example. Outside of that awesome. Also or me I have a good few similar style playlists, I'd love to be able to have control to add certain playlists together. Last thing promise which might sound a bit mad is curating your saved music by tempo - so for example its 5pm on a Saturday and youre preping food followed by friends arriving, then after food drinks begin to flow it's now 11pm and getting ready to hit the road to a bar etc. The tempo for me starts slow then gradually picks up - a lot of us will manually change playlists from chill to medium to upbeat. It would be so cool if I could pick a wave length and set a time frame for how that wave length/tempo change pans out. Its like a personal DJ where you decide if youre going down the rabbit hole or not and how quickly. Anyways love Spotify just as it is also - food for thought ‚úå"
It is a very intuitive program. I do wish it was better for android users to create playlists and edit the sequence of songs in the playlist. I also wish it was easier to save a song you like. Maybe just adding a check mark next to the title instead of the three dots to the menu each time. But I like it . I am discovering lots of new music. Thank you!
Great way to listen to music. Either build your own playlists or have them recommend music based on the bands and genres you like.
"For the most part, I like this app quite a bit. I signed on when it first opened years ago. I only have one big complaint: Maybe this has been fixed recently, but a couple years ago when Spotify got hacked, my account was destroyed & I could not get anyone to help me for weeks because I couldn't find out how. Eventually I lucked out & found out a place to email people and they did eventually help me. But my advice is, they need a customer service email and it needs to be common knowledge."
"As intuitive as can be, although synchronisation of settings between mobile and desktop devices can be improved (ie show last played consistently between either, private session on all devices running an account when activated)"
awesome app! would have liked it more if it was easier to add songs to your library or playlist with the click of a button. Because its a process now and i just dont have the time to sort 2k songs into a playlist by tap holding selecting etc.
I've been with Pandora almost since their conception. The Spotify algorithms are as good or better. Loving it so far...found quite a few of my new favorite songs.
"I use alot of music streaming apps, but i like this one because i like Mexican regional music and Spotify since its the more mainstream one gets them way before anyother app. I also quite enjoy the ps link it has, i can change my tone in gaming without leaving the game screen"
"The app is great. Has quite a complete music list. Very enjoyable to be your running buddy. Great sound. Great vibe. But, sometimes you need to manually shuffle the music even though you have put it on shuffle. Maybe because I haven't gone for a premium account. I am not sure. Overall, it is a great app!"
I love spotify but I often get quality drops that ruin the music session. Like the music is suddenly off key and sounds like there's an underwater type of effect. I thought it was my mobile network but It also happens when I listen on PC or tablet. Wonderful appoutside of that.
"Spotify has been a game changer for my life. All the music and podcasts I'd every want to listen to, in a great intuitive platform. Love it."
"I've tried all the streaming services and this one is by far the best. The player is superb, it does it all, good eq, crossfade and volume levelling across tracks. Easy to use, the playlists are intuitive and the library has pretty much everything."
No UI or battery issues to report. Seems to compress data well as my data usage isn't that high considering I use this app a lot in my car and on the move.
Spotify playlists are great and you can also make your own playlist to suit the occasion. Spotify is the best thing created for music lovers!
I have to give it up for the wicked awesome customer service. They're quick and ready to take action and help you in every way with the coolest attitudes! üòÑ I've been using Spotify for 4 years at least! Love it! Keep on rockin! (That's what they said hehe) ü§òüòé
"It's good, some of the settings are not as intuitive as I'd like since I prefer not to stream constantly. I'd like easier ways to select downloaded songs and create playlists"
"Great idea this app was. I just hope it becomes ubiquitous and universal, so that it could become the musical library of the world. Awesome, considering the offline mode."
"If they could get a built in equalizer tied specific to the app, it'd be perfect. I know license issues are a another story but, premium handles that perfectly"
Please do add some of the new features like a timer that we want to stop the music without play/pause the button and reminders to play by itself with selected times that we want. That'll be perfect!
"Im a constant Spotify user for quite some time already. But until today, theres always an error where Spotify wont detect my internet connection. I always had to force close my app and reopen it in order to temporary fix it. Spotify, please help me!"
"Great music app. Great design, easy to find what you're looking for. We'll priced subscription model. I use Spotify at home, at work for music and during my commute for podcasts that I can listen to offline."
I quite enjoy Spotify since I have been using it for quite some time now. It is definitely my main and favorite music app/source. I have been pleased with it overall.
Great selection with lots of hard to find artists. Easy to sort types and likes of music. Find myself building and listening to playlists more than I thought I would.
Awesome ! Having all the music in the world at my finger tips is incredible ! App has great recommendations and is very intuitive too ! Love it!
"Spotify has allowed me to step back into my youth and re-discover all the bands and artists that guided my interest in music. Its all there, simply search,press and enjoy."
Wide range of music that doesn't have many ads that ruin your music time so you can listen to music without the premium service.
"Discovering new or classic music has never been easier. You can save songs and make your own playlists or listen to ,,radio'' based on a song you like or an artist. Of course the commercials ruin everything but you can get rid of them with 6euros a month. Plus you have one month trial without commercials before deciding or not to pay."
"One of the beat music apps I've ever had. So convenient, love my recommended music/podcasts and easy to build/share playlists. Perf"
"I've used Spotify for many years. And even though it has some bugs, it's still great in comparison to other music streaming services. Love how I can take music offline and get playlists made for me from music I like. Can easily find the music fit for the occasion through User and Spotify made playlists, and make ones myself. Easy to use and great GUI. 5 stars and easily worth the money for premium."
The sound quality is superb when streaming over quality equipment. Spotify stays in the lane with a selection much better than other streaming apps.
"I like this app, but I really wish there was a ""song preview"" button that could be pressed and play the main chorus of the song. That is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5."
"Love Spotify and its intuition by playing songs related to the ones I play at the beginning lf my session. I'm just obsessed and I keep recommending it to everyone. Though, it should try to get more Asian music and instrumental."
"Good app, but pauses for no reason sometimes. Not sure that I'd call it a crash, but I can't continue playing music again but pressing the play button on my headphones, have to open the app and press play. That's my only complaint."
"It's great, we pay for the premium version with no ads which is worth it in my opinion! Sometimes the ""shuffling"" doesn't quite shuffle properly but not too bad. I like browsing through the alley created playlists - found some great music that way!"
I bought the premium and for some reason my music will just stop. Never paused it or hit any button's but it will just stop randomly. Dont like that after I paid for music to not stop. Other then that good app and has all my songs
"Very intuitive, very often the song you seach for starts playing immediately... Advertisment to song play time ratio is reasonable in my opinion... Great app!! And I rarely find apps that I would recommend!"
"It's a great app because you can listen to any music for free, but it requires data. However, if you're looking to play a specific song in Mobile, this isn't the best all unless your wanna pay $10/month on Premium."
"I want to download some playlists using my data but when I go to settings and try tapping the button to change it so I can download using my data nothing happens.. and yes my data works.. when I tap the button it remains grey like its disabled, it doesn't switch to green like when I tap other options... there is nothing I can find for support in the app for this matter.. I will change my review if fixed because this is a very good app otherwise."
"Zero complaints. However, Spotify should help us differentiate between playlists and stations, and should add a like/unlike button in the playlists, as also allow the user to unlike a previously or accidentally liked song."
"Would like to be able to play songs in order rather than being forced into shuffle mode. Otherwise, the app is good. Not too many audio ads (the pop-up ads are a little intrusive, though), and a fairly intuitive interface."
"Fantastically Amazing, not sure about your pre made playlist, I did not like them, mine are fine .Need more original copy not (ie not deluxe or remastered )but over all very good thank you !!!!"
Wish it would quit stopping out of no where. Stops playing at random times. And its not just me or my phone. Happens on all of my devices and my friends all experience the same problem. Other then that I enjoy the app
I like this app because you cam listem to all songs without downloading them and yoi can also find you genres that you didn't listen to before. If you're using something like the family thingy it's also quite cheap. It's also great for students.
"Been using Spotify for a few months now. Haven't had a single problem so far! Very clean-looking UI, has a great majority of music I listen to, and is very high quality! If you are looking for a music app, I'd recommend spotify over all else."
"Spotify delivers solid back-end performance, meaning, the AI working in the background builds solid playlists.. BUT, to find them, don't listen to the first choices, dig a little deeper by going to the higher numbered lists (like Daily Mix 6), and you will be rewarded.Go to Artist Radio from there and you will be rewarded further with the more eclectic gems.. Enjoy.."
"Over all I love Spotify. The only gripe is the search function which after several searches stops working, requiring you to close and reopen the app which is annoying"
Customer service is amazing. Great access and very easy to build playlists. Very consistent quality music. Just love it.
Some random but semi frequent bugs such as songs randomly stopping (requiring an app restart to fix) stop me from giving five stars. Premium is great value for money.
"Great app. The recurrent ads are pretty annoying and intrusive. Not as bad as pandora though, but still frequent enough to be a nuisance."
I absolutely love this music streaming service. I've been using it for years. The free version of the app gives you a good taste of whether or not you would enjoy premium although you get bombarded by ads for premium quite frequently. Nevertheless I highly recommend this app to anybody that is a music lover like myself.
"Even though I am not using the premium version, the app is very good and, unlike many other apps, does not require the premium to be used enjoyably. I recommended it to all of my friends who are not using it and soon enough I'm planning on buying premium."
"It's a good music app but it has a lot of ads though it has is 30 minute ad free thing but you have to have 2, 5 second ads and a 10 to 15 second ad and you have to stop your music and you have to reactivate it to get that luxury"
"Spotify is super easy to use, the layout is intuitive so it's easy to browse and/or search. The music playlists and recommendations are quite good... maybe not what I want 100% of the time but better than any other app I've used. I pay for a subscription but to me, it's totally worth the investment if you have a huge love of non mainstream music especially. Totally recommend!"
"The interface is pretty bad but usable. The redeeming factor is it works quite well with Google Assistant devices (Google Home, Chromecast, etc.) But this app is pretty bad and not as good as the iOS one. Marking playlists and queues is a pretty big pain that can be undone by an accidental key press (in comparison to Google Play Music)."
"Love it. I build my play lists, that I can download, and listen to even when I'm offline. It's an endless source of music and really comfortable to use."
"This app is nice if you want to listen music. Especially if you have the premuim, you can download music and listen where ever you want without wifi, and its free for 1 month then you pay!"
"Good performance paired with tricky, hard-to-find, and ever-changing settings. Offline mode surprisingly hard to use. Squirrelly music quality settings."
"Love how this app will suggest new music based on what I've chosen to listen to. Also, love that Spotify has podcasts! It helps make my work day go by so quickly."
"Great app, great design, easy to use, awesome deals for students. Only thing is that the app will crash occasionally on my Samsung Galaxy S8- I'm not the only one with this issue so it seems like it is unique to the S8"
"I'm extremely happy with Spotify. I was concerned I would spend fruitless hours trying to making it compatible with my music devices, happily I have to keep telling it to stop connecting to everything that plays! Well done, it's great not having to use iTunes. (the you need a. Degree in computer science to use)"
"Generally good, sometimes gets confused about whether it's online or not, and even worse sometimes forgets what it has downloaded, requiring a reinstall and redownload."
"This algorithm is fantastic. Not only that, it's very fast and the recs come quick and consistent. Outstanding. Worth every penny."
Overall been great. Wish UI worked as well on adroid as it does on Apple. Adding things to que and removing songs from playlist bit more time consuming.
Awesomeness! Pick ur playlist by selecting artists and songs you like build ur favorite songs up keeps track of your style of music suggests amazing other music in daily tracks menu. One commercial every 30 and 10 skips an hour but after that it's amazing for free. If you can afford premium then you're muck Better off still amazing for free too. Get it now!!!!!!!!!!!
"The Android app for Spotify is a pretty solid experience on the Huawei P20 Pro. The UI is very good for both looks and use. Audio quality options are nice for adapting to different bandwidth/storage scenarios. Of course, the service is missing the social aspects of great predecessors (RIP rdio), but you can still share tracks through other apps or SMS."
"As with any software there are a few bugs and probably some compatibility issues with certain devices. For example, I be had a few issues with the App's quick menu not functioning properly or at all, but other than that it's a pretty great service."
Pro version definitely worth it - gives you great music quality. I'm using Spotify to rebuild my iPod library. Apple is way too greedy as far as I'm concerned especially since I primarily use a PC or android ph9ne for music. I can't find every song from my iTunes but the majority are there.
"Good app, high selection for free, disappointed at the limited capacity to make and enjoy playlists on the free version, but aside from that I'm quite satisfied."
I wish I could rearrange songs and they got rid of the stupid shuffle play button. Makes it impossible to organize because it scrambles everything. At least be able to turn the thing off.
"It's really good to have an spotify premium account, but still there are some playback bugs and the UI is getting old and boring and the lyrics are not lyrics but they are stories from genius."
Could be a 5 star rating but you keep changing functions that were good and mess upp quite often with the codeing for communication between devices. Put som more love and recognition at the people who build this platform.
"Good app, I spend loads of time on it. I don't mind the ads. Good range of music choices. Please add a button to see how many minutes of music you've listened to that day / week / month!"
"It's pretty good. I was using the free version for quite a while, until my brother got me a gift card for three months of Premium. I've downloaded sooOOOOOOOOOoooo much music for offline listening now and I'm spoiled with the unlimited skips, so I'm gonna be just fine with paying for it once the gift card runs out. 9/10 let's get the SleepyCabin Podcast on here"
"First app I've used to purchase music beyond iTunes. I've lost touch of keeping my music organized and up to date with since the demise of free music software, so hoping I can build a new permanent accessible library with Spotify's technology."
"Perfect app for building playlist, and storing them without using space on your device. Great selection of any genre of music you want and could possibly think of!"
"Little issue with certain buttons not having prompts or the ability to undo, so if you click something, you'd better mean it, but otherwise does everything I was expecting and then some."
"I've not yet been unhappy with it. Reacts strangely with my LG phone as far as will quit playing randomly, but i believe that is more about the processing power of the phone. Great app!"
"More intuitive to interact with and and more correctly intuitive digital dj decision equations. A wider and deeper variety of music than most, simply the best.."
"Very good, easy to use... has a good mixes of songs that were built by fans. The only disadvantage that i found was the absence of the songs lyrics"
I love the ability to control what I listen to and build custom playlist that suit any occasion. Keep it up Spotify!
"Honestly, I find a lot more indie bands and musicians on here than anything. All the big names dislike their pay model, but unknowns get way more exposure than they would w/o it. Listen to artists you don't know then hit the radio button for more."
"A simply amazing app! Runs great, easy to use UI, incredible music quality. The best way to enjoy your favorite songs, whichever genre or artist they might be from."
I love this app but the only thing is that sometimes it crashes and I have to uninstall the app then reinstall. It also won't let me share any music when I click the share button.
"I love this app. Let's cut the bull poop, the Spotify, Pandora and YouTube music users are more divided than America on the presidency. I prefer Spotify even though they all work the same, and the main difference is the UI. DOWNLOAD THIS APP"
"It has improved a lot through the years but could still use a few more features. For example, there's no button to clear the song queue instantly."
Super user experience. Able to play on one device and control playback with another. Seamless transfer from one device to another.
I'm a spotifyholic. Excellent platform. Once in a while it doesn't quickly pair up with my Bose sound touch but I fix it by turning my wifi on and off
Brilliant range of music to suit all ages and tastes. Found albums and tracks I thought were lost forever. Couldn't be happier. Thank you
Hate the 6 skips per hour system. Also random songs in an album is annoying. And if you skip you can't even find your own song in your designated album and waste all 6 skips.
"Great music selection! Can even find a tonne of not so well known international artists! And discover weekly can have some really good suggestions. However, the app istelf isn't the best it can be yet imo. It has little quirks here and there that can be a bit annoying."
"Quick and easy to use. Probably the best music streaming app for 10 bucks, unless you get the family pack which makes it even cheaper."
I couldn't live without Spotify. I am a student and subscribed it with their awesome payment plan. The premium features are just way to good to use. The in-built cards with facts and lyrics on top of each song is what makes Spotify stand out and makes sure there is no Competition for their rivals. Spotify ‚ô•
"I've been a premium Spotify user for almost 2 years now and I love it! Spotify truly knows me. My personal mixes are rarely bad and thanks to Spotify, I've found quite a few is my new favourite artists and genres! DON'T HESITATE. Download this app. Get a premium subscription. Find new music. Simple."
I love my classical music and have been very pleasantly surprised by the choice of performances Spotify offers. Streaming quality is excellent and downloading for offline listening is quick and easy.
This app sometimes bugs out and I have to restart it but that may be more my phone than the app. I love the UI of this app and the music they offer. I use Spotify atleast 10 times a day.
"As a digital designer, you can feel the passion and effort going into this app. It is definitely created for the user experience. They are my favourite music app and they probably always will be if they keep existing."
Build playlists and download to your device for when you are offline. Great app with what seems to be unlimited music selection.
"I like this app compared to most other apps I have used, but the adds and amount is not suitable for my taste, it says 30 minutes of ad free music, then you get an ad after two songs"
"Love my premium subscription, they have nearly every song I've looked for. However if you don't plan to get premium, the adds and restricted skips are quite annoying like any other app"
"I love Spotify. Premium is so much better, however. You can skip music, build playlist, listen to radio stations built on an artist and so much more. Huge music lover so Spotify is on all day at work."
"The app seems to have been less well than usual after the updates. My playlist takes a while to load songs (downloaded playlist), and doesn't load all of the playlist. Sometimes the forward button doesn't work so you have to pause the song for a few seconds"
Easily the best music service out there. Quality app with almost no bugs to speak of. The support for the app is also great as bugs are fixed very quickly. The UI is clean and simple to use. I have nothing but great things to say about this product.
Spotify has been an active participant in my life every day for the past two years. I can't imagine not listening to playlists or keeping up with my favorite artists without it. I genuinely enjoy using it and would recommend it to anyone.
"I've been a Spotify Premium for user for years now, and I'm incredibly satisfied with my user experience. Only rarely have I not been able to find a song, and the Spotify algorithm for finding songs I like is absolutely amazing. Well worth the monthly cost!"
"I love this ap but I think the layout/navigation need updating. When I hit my ""back"" button, it doesn't continuously go back to the last page. After 2 back clicks you end up on the home page of your phone. Annoying!!"
"I spend at least 4 hours a day on Spotify. Well worth the ¬£10/month fee. Course, I wish it was cheaper, but hey - the offline mode is great. I just wish the 'built for you' piece, when playing music in your library, didn't use data. The song is in my library, there's no need for that."
Wasn't sure it was worth the subscription at first but you are quickly sold on the potential of Spotify. Most of the time the trickiest part is figuring out what you want to listen to.
Good selection of music and the app is fairly intuitive. Some minor navigation issues and the library is missing some artists (or earlier releases from existing artists) that one might reasonably expect to find. Good overall and better than others by far; my streaming service of choice.
Easily my favorite music app. The playlists specifically designed to users musical preferences are my favorite part. Fridays and Mondays are my favorite days of the week thanks to Spotify!
It's Spotify. The app has been quite glitchy recently songs just seem to pause themselves and when trying to play songs on Bluetooth it sometimes goes off on its own tangent.
"I have been using Spotify for 2 - 3 years now and I like. these day there seem to be so many bugs when using the interface, sometime Spotify refuse to close when you exit the app and more. I hope it get fixed. Except these bugs, it's quite good."
Lately I have not been able to search and download new music not sure if they have over expanded themselves and have not built enough data centers to handle the traffic.
Love getting all my music from spotify! Easy to make your own playlists and quickly! Have a family plan which my whole house is able to use and it is a pretty great deal I think :)
"Best music app on the market (paid or free) if you're into finding, collecting and listening to your old found songs or discovering new ones. I love building my lifetime playlists. I hope there around forever."
Spotify Premium is genuinely the best investment I've ever made. On it 24/7. Wish they paid artists more. Has occasional glitches that can be super annoying but I love it!
"Amazing capabilities, certain UX things just don't make sense and can be a little confusing at times. Still the best app out for this type of listening by a good bit"
"Really liking it, but it's hard to figure out how to do simple things like clearing my queue etc. It can definitely be more intuitive."
"Only pay ¬£5 a month because I get a student discount and it is well worth the money. As long as my phone has the storage I can download as many albums and podcasts as I want, and there's a massive variety to choose from. It's easy to find new music that I like as well because the app actually suggests things suited to my tastes"
"Great app, apart from a few glitches, like the notification song play button not working properly sometimes, and the songs name not tracking to the current song"
"It's quite a good app free, or with premium. However I wish you could access songs you pressed dislike on to undo it. I have heard its quite a common issue"
"Tbh this app is the best thing to use to listen to music besides mp3 juice. It's great to use, I found sum of my old music that i thought i would never find again but i found sum of them... u guys should get this app trust me you'll love it."
"Best music, talk, news & podcast app I've used! Lots of features, very intuitive and never invasive. Man... The future is finally here!"
"Works super great with the xbox, seemless, good quality audio via Bluetooth or headphone. I have found a lot of music because of it, I had such a bad view of Spotify before I used it, it's worth the money to have that music at the touch of a button on all my devices, just makes life easier."
"Best music app I've used. You can listen to podcast here, build playlist of your favourite music and share it. The auto playlist are great as well."
It's a good app you can't use it as well if you don't have the latest version and can't download music if you have premium on a older version I actually had quite a bit of trouble today to the point I've had to delete and reinstall the app. In general the app is ok but if you have premium it's good.
"Great music app. However, in recent releases it randomly stops playing either between or in the middle of a song requiring you to have to unlock your phone and restart the music."
"I've had this problem, and I know my sister has also had this problem. Music will be playing and all if a sudden it will pause. You have to press the play button again for it to play again. It would play for a few seconds and then it would pause. We love Spotify, but we don't know why this is happening to us."
I've noticed that the music I like which is loud music is making itself go quite with each update to the app can you make the app have an opinion to make the music loud btw I listen to my music at full volume.
"Good, except for one issue. The app is very quiet. Soundcloud, in comparison, is much louder and does not require me to turn the volume to almost max."
Great service but this app is kinda bad. All kinds of annoying UI issues that really take away from the enjoyment. Using for over a year and it never gets better.
"I just wish the payment and family sharing methods were less confusing. My family couldn't get it to work, and when I wanted to upgrade to premium for myself after unsubscribing previously, there was no button for a single account. That is to say that I had only the option to pay the family price."
"EDIT: I got it fixed thanks to the help section :) Just uninstalled then reinstalled it. - - - I loved this app so much, and now my phone won't quit warning me that it is sucking up tons of battery, so it puts it to sleep and causes all kinds of problems with functionality. What happened?! :("
I've been using Spotify for almost 4 years. If you're looking for what you want when you want this is the app. You can build playlist or search through other playlists üíØ x better than Pandora
