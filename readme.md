Spotify Review Analysis (Google Play Store)


=======
# Spotify Review Analysis (Google Play Store) with regard to App Design
- Scraped the data with google_play_scraper (126166 reviews)
- Filtered reviews for certain design-words (11701 reviews)
- Created wordclouds for different ratings (1-5)
- Analyzed the wordclouds

Key Findings:
- Frequency rating containing design words- 1: 38228, 5: 36357, 4: 17761, 2: 17406, 3: 16414
- The reviews range from 2022-07-28 to 2018-09-12
- One has to analyze the reviews containing information about design manually to find repetitive feedback on a common aspect
- The information content seems to vary a lot within the reviews
- The wordcloud is not the ideal way to analyze reviews from the PlayStore
- A more specific approach (qualitative interviews) seems to be the better approach
