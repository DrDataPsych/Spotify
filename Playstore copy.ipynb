None; apart from on Spotify you control the music you want to listen to when you want to listen to. I love this app. I'm downloading again as I had to free up space on my phone.

       "61688  A great app for listening to the music of your choice and even adding your own playlists. Adverts are included but that's why we can get this top app for free! Adverts don't bother me; if you listen to the radio then there's adverts on music radio stations so what's the difference? None; apart from on Spotify you control the music you want to listen to when you want to listen to. I love this app. I'm downloading again as I had to free up space on my phone. Now I can reinstall again. Happy dayz...oh yeah! Thank you Spotify for this amazing app.   \n",
